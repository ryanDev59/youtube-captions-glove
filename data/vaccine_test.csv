0,had a great time at the marxism socialism conference okay you're good now you can send an email really just it's only about 10 more kilometers guys keep up come on hurry up come on not gonna burn those burgers off like this i'm louis spears i'm here at the marxism 2019 conference in melbourne because of course it's in melbourne and uh we're just going to have a look around see all of the events there's a big program on today so we're going to talk to some people and just find out all about marxism socialism and what these people have to say i also hear that there's a counter protest by the proud boys great when you're not on anyone's side let's go and talk to the people we're outside the marxism 2019 conference uh there's a couple of demonstrations outside already we've got the the proud boys here uh doing a counter rally preaching for the for the pros of capitalism and then over here we've got uh all of the marxists and uh to be honest i'm feeling a little bit torn because my haircut matches these guys but my malnourished body matches these guys so i don't really know which team to choose here if you look through the history books as we all know every socialist revolution starts with selling tickets to a conference so it's off to the box office and the price of tickets to the marxist conference depends on your personal income if you had a job tickets were 130 dollars if you had a high paying job there were 160 but if you had no job they were still 90 now socialism as we all know is not well known for its corruption so this system would be impossible to cheat so i decided to put it to the test unwedged forty dollars cool thank you appreciate it system for my own benefit i felt like i was starting to understand socialism but it was time to talk to other people at the marxist conference and you're here at the uh the socialist conference why did you come here 2019 i don't know i honestly think i just wanted to hear a couple different speakers a couple different perspectives so you consider yourself a bit of a leninist yeah probably a leninist matter i'm sure you know who vladimir lenin is yes i do yeah great mustache yep not so much the best human rights record but a great mustache now at this point i've only been at the marxist conference for five minutes but as soon as we pulled a camera out the conference organizers surrounded me and my camera guy to make sure that i don't say anything negative about socialism and i think it was this harmless joke that made everything go wrong so what what don't they want to talk about uh so things surrounding the ussr they won't have any legitimate conversation about it like i'm not gonna well neither would the ussr either themselves so at least they're consistent because of that fairly tame joke i was told by official organizers that i had been banned from the conference for harassing people and the two guys i interviewed with their permission were told that i was a far right content creator if joking about the ussr is far right i suppose tearing down the berlin wall was the biggest alt-right uprising of all time i've been i've been kicked out told i'm not allowed to come in which is uh which is a shame got told i was harassing people because i got an interview with two boys who are very happy to have an interview so uh you know come down lots of friendly accepting people here open to many points of view it is 55 though do you guys know if the ticket price gets distributed at the end i guess they just keep it i would say the best thing about getting kicked out of an event is you can walk down the street and you get an entourage right they won't let you go on the curb but you can walk down the street so i might just walk up and back for a little bit this might be the best exercise these guys have gotten for a little bit this is this is great guys this is very funny it's time for the great marxist marathon on your marks get set it was at this point the marxist realized i might be taking the piss however i had one final trick up my sleeve could i go back to the box office and ask for a refund i just wanted to get a refund for my ticket price that's all right immediately i started to become surrounded by gender fluid front fringes things were starting to feel more crowded than a communist breadline but somehow even less hygienic are you good now i just wanted to get a refund there's no refunds not really much point to you being here okay right i'm not sure if you've noticed you're not really making friends policy is generally no reason no refunds okay you can send an email though do you guys all talk with sarcasm was it just you my plan to get a refund had failed however it seemed like these socialists were in desperate need of some good old-fashioned exercise after all they have a revolution to pull off soon so to get these ladies moving i decided to tell a lie i did park i did park down there so can i get to my car um i reckon you should head back that way back this way i can't get to my own car i just think heading back that way is probably for the best i think i might just go this way though well you can cross the road as well as your car over there my plan was working these ladies were finally getting some exercise in now just how far could i get them to walk parked on this side of the road though have you so yeah it was working after a quick warm-up it was time to run some drills is this really how you're spending your weekend yeah this is how you're spending yours you guys are being meaner to me than you are to the proud boys is this because i've got the same haircut as them do we have to walk slow look how long my legs are man we had now been walking for 500 meters the communists were beginning to get suspicious so where's where's your car my car yep it's the red one just there another 100 meters to go keep up comrades there's a lot of marching to do when you've got a revolution to run finally after 10 minutes of walking we'd made it to the car and next to the car were some of my harassment victims i actually got the train here but hey when when we got that interview was that harassment these are the only boys i've spoken to harassment sorry guys for harassing you i just wanna yeah we got a photo man all right as you can see these two victims of my harassment have developed some form of stockholm syndrome and it seems my workout has turned these ladies into fans one two three sorry for harassing these boys do you accept sure all right cool thank you all right have a good day boys enjoy it how are you guys harassed i feel i feel a little bit harassed to be honest you weren't harassed at all like genuinely yeah that's that's cool this isn't about you that's right this is about fitness i should just leave i'm trying to leave i told you i'm trying to get i'm trying to get to my car see it no i didn't i took the training but really private property is more of a concept isn't it i feel like this is clearly to these ladies it doesn't matter that there's no car at the end of this walk what really matters is the journey itself i swear man marathon here i'm gonna do laps at this point we'd been walking for 15 minutes and some of my clients were getting a little bit annoyed i decided this would be the perfect time for a motivational instagram story i had a great time at the marxism socialism conference here a few of my friends they're just escorting me away making sure i get to my car safely apparently i was harassing people for asking for interviews and opinions on socialism but um i think really what happened is they saw my hair cut and they must have gone hitler 2.0 so um just it's only about 10 more kilometers guys keep up come on all these short-legged pants can't keep up with me hurry up come on not going to burn those burgers off like this finally after 40 minutes of walking they've had enough bye bye just kidding time for another lap ladies well that was eventful wasn't it thank you very much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed it make sure you share it around if you want more of these as well we love doing the field pieces they are please do share it with your friends if you liked it subscribe we'll be doing more very very soon and uh big thanks to the marxism 2019 conference organizers i cannot wait to bring fitness to the 2020 conference uh and uh please do let me know about my money as well i would like my refund you guys don't need it i mean you're all communist what do you want money for you don't need it so send it my

 palms aren't sweating. When you walk into the surgery room, the O.R , as a new student and you
 haven't been there a lot. Your palms just start spraying sweat like it's sprinkler fluid. Sprinkler fluid? I remember when I was a resident. I was nervous doing a procedure and I was putting on his

 your hands like this, or like this, or like this, because you can't drop them too low because that area is not sterile. You can't put them on your face because that's not sterile. So you have to like keep
 everything like this. And if you sneeze... you have to sneeze forward. The worst thing that you can do is turn to the side and sneeze. Because at all this sneeze stuff all this sneeze stuff.... all the sneeze particles comes out onto the patient from

 to getting a circumcision. There are health risks to
 getting a circumcision. The health benefits are
 pretty few and far between. But if some people for religious reasons want to get one and there
 are some health benefits. We do do them. Let's make a circumcision video. No, wait, that sounds bad. Let's make a video
 discussing circumcision. - ""I pass this every day, "" ""and it always seems like

 are rotations going?"" ""what I say 'living the dream'."" (laughing) ""what would mean"" - ""Dr. Any drugs?
 Patients in the E.R: Nope (laughs) - I'll have young folks come in and they look like they just
 came from a rave concert from Ultra Coachella
 burning man, whatever it is. And they're like, ""I don't feel good Doc"" and I'm like, ""well tell me what's
 been going on would you?"" - ""Oh, I just came back from this concert' ""We were raving all weekend."" - Well, ""did you do any drugs?"" - ""No."" - Did you drink any alcohol no... tell me let's talk about it. How can I help you if
 I don't know the truth. - ""Vaccines cause adults"" (laughs) - I'll take all the
 immunity got thanks Pam. I would wear that shirt. Vaccines cause adults. You know what's funny? I could totally see an anti
 vacs person seeing that being like, ""oh my God
 you believe in that too"" - ""when a patient's
 blood pressure is off."" ""So the attending asks
 you to take you manually,"" ""thinking it will
 somehow be more accurate"" (laughs) - It's so easy to check blood pressure. You should know how to do it do not lose your art of the physical exam. - ""Do you need another
 stool sample doctor?"" ""I didn't even ask for the first one."" - ""Doctor: your wife is pregnant."" ""No, she isn't I was wearing a condom."" ""Yeah, but I wasn't."" - Why all the things about doctors cheating with their patients wives. I can't understand. - ""Ask yourself."" ""Is she actually thick?"" ""Or is she just suffering
 from lumbar lordosis"" - Whenever you say lordosis or kyphosis that's actually the
 curvature of the spine. And if you have extra kyphosis, or extra lordosis, it accentuates that curve. - ""Doctor: you're going to be a vegetable"" ""for the rest of your life."" ""Patient: I'm vegan so that's amazing."" (laughs) - Speaking of vegan... I'm about to make a 30-day vegan video... Shhh.... I can't believe I'm doing it. I'm giving up the meats.

0,"Let’s say your car breaks down in the middle
 of the desert, or in a howling blizzard. Your phone battery is dead, and you didn’t stock up on food
 and water like you maybe should’ve. How are you gonna get out of this one? If you find yourself in a survival situation,
 you’re going to have certain priorities: water, not dying of exposure, not being
 mauled by wild animals, and, y’know, getting back to wi-fi as soon
 as possible so you can watch SciShow. For most folks, food can
 actually be a lower priority. But there’s a lot of bad survival info out there. Some tips seem too good
 to be true, and they are. Others are ingrained enough to be
 common knowledge, except they’re wrong. So here’s a list of 8 survival tips
 you definitely shouldn’t follow, and what to do instead. First up: water. What about all the snow that’s piling up
 in the blizzard? That is made of water. Snow can be safe to eat, especially if it’s
 freshly fallen. While it can collect contaminants as it falls,
 things like soot from wood fires and coal plants, that generally won’t be enough to
 hurt you. Snow that’s already on been the ground for
 a while is riskier, since it might have accumulated, like, who knows what, pollutants
 from the road, maybe, you know, you can insert
 your own yellow snow joke here. But eating snow might be a
 bad idea for a different reason: It has to melt inside your body,
 and that uses your body heat. Water has a high heat capacity, because it has pretty strong bonds holding
 the molecules together. So you need a lot of energy to break those
 bonds to boil liquid water or melt ice. Energy your body would otherwise
 be using to keep you warm. Plus, you’d have to eat a lot of
 snow to get enough water, since piles of snow contain a lot of air. So to keep your body temperature from falling
 too much, find a way to melt the snow first. But the worst way to do that is to like hold
 it against your skin to melt it. Don’t do that, it’s still going to cool
 you down. If you’re in the desert, don’t count on cactuses
 as, like, secret jugs of fresh spring water. There’s a lot of water in there, yeah. But there’s also a bunch of noxious chemicals. Cactuses use an unusual type
 of photosynthesis, called CAM. CAM photosynthesis uses way less water than
 other kinds, so it’s handy in the desert. CAM plants gather CO2 through pores at night
 and store it in the form of organic acids. Then they can close those pores during
 the day to minimize water loss, using the stored carbon to get on with the
 light-dependent parts of photosynthesis. For storage, they mainly use malic acid, which
 isn’t so bad for you. It’s in various fruits, although too much
 can irritate your mouth. But many CAM plants also make oxalic acid. Oxalic acid is toxic, because it binds to
 calcium, which can mess up your body. It can also build up in your kidneys
 in the form of calcium oxalate, the stuff kidney stones are made of. In addition to the acids, a lot of cactus
 flesh contains alkaloids, which are a diverse family of plant chemicals that generally aren’t
 nice to eat and can really affect your body. Cactus juice won’t get you high, like it
 did to Sokka in Avatar: The Last Airbender. But it can make you sick enough
 to cause puking or diarrhea, which will dehydrate you
 and make matters worse. Fishhook barrel cactuses and young prickly
 pear cactuses contain few enough of the unpleasant chemicals to be kind of edible when raw. They still don’t taste good,
 but they’ll do in a bind. But you’d better be pretty confident in
 your botany skills. Bodily fluids are also mostly water, so you
 might think you can recycle them. Drinking urine might help you
 survive ever so slightly longer, but it’s only safe to do for a day or so. That’s because the waste products
 in your pee are waste for a reason. If you put them back in your body, they’ll build
 up faster than your kidneys can eliminate them. And that can send you into a state similar
 to kidney failure, with your body unable to process all of the potassium, nitrogen compounds,
 and calcium you’re throwing at it. As for blood… it’s sometimes
 safe to eat in small amounts. In certain places, it’s fairly common,
 but that’s more for its protein and iron content
 than as a source for water. In large amounts, which you’d need to stay
 hydrated, blood contains more iron than your body can handle, and it becomes toxic. Your body tries to store it in
 places like your heart and liver, but that can lead to organ failure and death. Plus, you’re at risk from bloodborne pathogens. So going full vampire to survive is probably
 not the best idea. But let’s say you’ve found some water, and
 now you need a way to get home without GPS. And maybe you’ve heard that moss always
 grows on the north sides of trees. This is one of those things that’s true in
 general, but not 100% reliable all of the time. So it’s not so useful for navigation. Here in the northern hemisphere, the northern
 side of a tree will get the least sunlight, thanks to the Earth’s tilt. That means the northern side of the tree is
 most likely to be shady, cool, and damp, all things that moss likes. Mosses are non-vascular plants,
 which aren’t as good at retaining water as other types of plants. They essentially lack the plumbing
 to transport water inside of them, so they need all the moisture they can get. So if some other situation is creating good
 conditions on any particular side of a tree, moss can grow there just fine. It’s not necessarily pointing north,
 it’s just the nice-for-moss side. You’re going to need some shelter too,
 or at least a way to stay warm. And you might have seen people
 in old-timey books or shows giving a swig of booze to warm
 someone up, especially in a blizzard. This one almost seems intuitive, because alcohol
 brings a flush of warmth to your cheeks. But that is the exact opposite of what you
 want if you need to stay warm. Alcohol is a vasodilator, meaning it opens
 up the blood vessels near the surface of your skin, probably by altering your brain’s
 blood vessel controls. That increased blood flow is why you might
 feel or look flushed when you’re drunk. But it also transports warmth
 towards the surface of your skin, where it can conveniently diffuse away from
 your body and into the colder air nearby. Thanks, thermodynamics. When your body is trying to stay warm, it
 actually constricts those blood vessels to try and conserve warmth in your
 internal organs and your brain, which need to stay at
 37 degrees Celcius to keep ticking. Don’t undo that hard work. And if you’re cold, rubbing yourself to
 stay warm seems intuitive, the friction generates a bit of warmth. But once frostbite sets in, that is a horrible
 idea. On a cellular scale, frostbite means ice crystals
 are starting to form in your tissues. And ice crystals are sharp. They can puncture cell membranes
 and other cellular structures, not to mention freeze the water
 those cells were using to live. Rubbing will jostle those sharp chunks of
 ice around, and cause them to rupture nearby cells. That’s going to make things much worse. Also, even though it’s painful, it’s not
 good to thaw those frostbitten toes if they’re still at risk of refreezing. More ice forming again will do more damage
 and risk more permanent loss of tissue. Frostbite mostly affects the extremities. If hypothermia actually sets in, meaning the
 body’s core temperature has dropped below 35 degrees, the key is careful,
 slow reintroduction of warmth. Plunging a victim of hypothermia in a hot
 tub could cause irregular heart rhythm or even a heart attack. The proper way to treat frostbite
 and hypothermia is, like, by a doctor, but when that’s not possible, caution is best. Try to sit tight, and don’t risk doing more harm. Finally, on your way home, it’s best
 if you can avoid being mauled, bitten, or stung by anything. But if you are, be careful
 what advice you listen to. Like, that one myth that tells you to like,
 slice open the snakebite and suck out the toxin. The effects of snakebite vary based on the
 kind of snake and the venom it’s packing. Some bites may cause severe
 tissue damage and internal bleeding, while others are neurotoxins, there’s a bunch! Snake venoms are fascinating! So in reality, this so-called “treatment” will
 increase the risk of the wound getting infected, possibly spread the venom into the
 victim’s bloodstream much faster, and not actually remove very much venom. In other words, don’t do it. An article published in the
 New England Journal of Medicine in 2002 strongly discourages incision
 and suction for snakebites. Instead, they recommend keeping the
 wound below the level of the heart, keeping the victim warm, avoiding tourniquets
 or any kind of restrictive clothing or jewelry, and getting to the hospital as soon as possible. Hospitals can administer
 antivenom to neutralize the bite. Antivenom is made up of antibodies that
 are carefully made to bind to the venom and stop it from having effects on your body. Since different snakes make different
 kinds of venom, one of the main things is to remember as much as you can
 about what the snake looked like. You don’t need to, like, catch the snake
 and, like, bring it along with you though, that’s not gonna help; nobody’s gonna
 like that. And some kinds of antivenom work for multiple
 kinds of snakes. It depends on the exact cocktail of antibodies. So you’re best off leaving the treatment,
 hey, to professionals, because I don’t think you have a venom-binding
 antibody serum in your back pocket, and if you do, that should be refrigerated! And last but not least, suppose you’re
 stranded on the shore instead of in a forest and got a nasty jellyfish sting. Should you just… pee on it? Besides sounding totally gross and weird,
 it’s not worth it. Pee doesn’t work, and it might
 even make things worse. Jellyfish tentacles contain
 stinging cells called cnidocytes, which discharge tiny harpoon-like stingers
 when they touch you, plus the venom. And some of that venom can poke holes in cells
 or cause all kinds of biological mayhem. But not many of the cnidocytes on a stinging
 tentacle fire when you first touch it. So the trick is to get it off you without
 triggering the thousands of others. The myth claims that urine
 will neutralize those cnidocytes, so they don’t go off and sting you. But certain chemical changes can
 fire off cnidocytes as well as touch. Like, alcohol is known to trigger them. And at least one study has shown
 that urine can do so as well. A 2017 study published in the journal Toxins
 found that many popular sting treatments, including scraping the stung area with a credit
 card or shaving cream, don’t work. Seawater can help you rinse them off, but
 it won’t chemically prevent them from firing. That’s where jellyfish live, after all. Instead, they found that a good
 dousing with vinegar is best, which is just the chemical acetic acid. That will actually neutralize the ones
 that haven’t stung you yet, maybe by bringing the pH too low
 for them to function. Then the tentacles can be carefully
 plucked away by tweezers, and heating pads will help
 ease the pain of a sting. Now, you may never need to use any
 of these tips, I certainly hope you don’t, but there’s a lot of misinformation out there,
 and emergency survival is something you don’t really want to take chances with. So a little bit of scientific rigor is maybe the
 best way to know if a tip could save your life or make things much worse. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow! If you want to keep learning more about

-1,"10,000 years ago, a deadly virus arose in northeastern Africa. The virus spread through the air, attacking the skin cells, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes of its victims. The unlucky infected developed fevers, vomiting, and rashes. 30% of infected people died during the second week of infection. Survivors bore scars and scabs for the rest of their lives. Smallpox had arrived. In 1350 B.C., the first smallpox epidemics hit during the Egypt-Hittite war. Egyptian prisoners spread smallpox to the Hittites, which killed their king and devastated his civilization. Insidiously, smallpox made its way around the world via Egyptian merchants, then through the Arab world with the Crusades, and all the way to the Americas with the Spanish and Portuguese conquests. Since then, it has killed billions of people with an estimated 300 to 500 million people killed in the 20th century alone. But smallpox is not unbeatable. In fact, the fall of smallpox started long before modern medicine. It began all the way back in 1022 A.D. According to a small book, called ""The Correct Treatment of Small Pox,"" a Buddhist nun living in a famous mountain named O Mei Shan in the southern providence of Sichuan would grind up smallpox scabs and blow the powder into nostrils of healthy people. She did this after noticing that those who managed to survive smallpox never got it again, and her odd treatment worked. The procedure, called variolation, slowly evolved and by the 1700's, doctors were taking material from sores and putting them into healthy people through four or five scratches on the arm. This worked pretty well as inoculated people would not get reinfected, but it wasn't foolproof. Up to three percent of people would still die after being exposed to the puss. It wasn't until English physician Edward Jenner noticed something interesting about dairy maids that we got our modern solution. At age 13, while Jenner was apprentice to a country surgeon and apothecary in Sodbury, near Bristol, he heard a dairy maid say, ""I shall never have smallpox, for I have had cowpox. I shall never have an ugly, pockmarked face."" Cowpox is a skin disease that resembles smallpox and infects cows. Later on, as a physician, he realized that she was right, women who got cowpox didn't develop the deadly smallpox. Smallpox and cowpox viruses are from the same family. But when a virus infects an unfamiliar host, in this case cowpox infecting a human, it is less virulent, so Jenner decided to test whether the cowpox virus could be used to protect against smallpox. In May 1796, Jenner found a young dairy maid, Sarah Nelmes, who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand and arm caught from the utters of a cow named Blossom. Using matter from her pustules, he inoculated James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of his gardener. After a few days of fever and discomfort, the boy seemed to recover. Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy again, this time with matter from a fresh smallpox lesion. No disease developed, and Jenner concluded that protection was complete. His plan had worked. Jenner later used the cowpox virus in several other people and challenged them repeatedly with smallpox, proving that they were immune to the disease. With this procedure, Jenner invented the smallpox vaccination. Unlike variolation, which used actual smallpox virus to try to protect people, vaccination used the far less dangerous cowpox virus. The medical establishment, cautious then as now, deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. But eventually vaccination was gradually accepted and variolation became prohibited in England in 1840. After large vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the World Health Organization certified smallpox's eradication in 1979. Jenner is forever remembered as the father of immunology, but let's not forget the dairy maid Sarah Nelmes, Blossom the cow, and James Phipps, all heroes in this great adventure of vaccination who helped eradicate smallpox."

 What do we have here oh no no those are cashews. So is this like a bowl full of
 death to you? Yes, well cashews aren't as strong of a reaction for me but I am
 allergic to tree nuts. It's not fun, it's not fun at all. Hey smart people, Joe here.
 I recently invited my friend wheezy waiter to come by and talk about food
 allergies. Just one, they're not real cashews, they're stunt cashews. Of course
 you should never trick a friend with the food that they're allergic to, but it's
 okay wheezy waiter and I are friends, and I'm
 a doctor. These days most of us know someone with a food allergy, some food
 they have to avoid eating, or even coming into contact with in order to avoid a
 dangerous reaction or even death. But why are people allergic to food? And why are
 food allergies on the rise? It's nuts. Maybe I'm just getting old but
 it seems like food allergies are more common than they used to be. Well we're
 not imagining things, scientific data backs that up. The
 percentage of children with food allergy has definitely increased in recent years.
 I'm allergic to all tree nuts so I'm allergic to walnuts, pine nuts, almonds,
 cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pistachios -  here in Texas - pecans
 everywhere. Not pecans no pecans I always say pecans, but you've taught me it's
 pecans. Yeah I play the right way yeah. That stuff ends up in a lot of different
 foods, so I imagine you have to have accidentally encountered this stuff before.
 I have accidentally encountered almost all those that I listed. What happens is my mouth swells up, my throat swells up, I get hives, I get hives
 in my lungs, I can't breathe, horrible stomachache, and it lasts for
 three hours. But I don't think about reading labels and that's a whole
 difference about how we navigate the world as things that I don't have to
 think about and you do. And especially now it seems like the nuts are cropping
 up in everything like barbecue sauce or cocktails, like drinks now like to have
 walnut bitters in them. To make matters even more confusing, adults can also
 become allergic to foods that they never had issues with as children. I'm Emily
 Graslie I am the host and creator of the YouTube
 channel The Brain Scoop and I work for the Field Museum as their Chief
 Curiosity Correspondent. So I saw on Twitter recently that you aren't getting
 along with certain kinds of nuts very well anymore. Yeah I've never had a
 problem really with any sort of food you know, but otherwise never have had
 any sort of allergy whatsoever then a weird thing happened. Why don't we try
 almond milk for the first time? I never tried it. The next morning just routine
 morning on my way to work I had my bowl of cereal, poured the almond milk on it
 and I got to work and I noticed that my nose was just dripping like a
 faucet, and I realized I was hot and itchy, and I noticed that I was just
 absolutely covered in full-body hives. I just was like this is really weird.
 Now a true food allergy is different from a food intolerance. This is really
 important like if you're lactose intolerant and you can't digest cow's
 milk. It can make you feel really sick Aches,  pains and digestive troubles,  that
 kind of stuff. But if you're allergic to milk, it could kill you. A true allergy
 is when your body's immune system has a reaction to the food on a molecular
 level. It's your body treating food as a germ or an invader, which actually
 doesn't make sense. Let's look at how this works. Food is made up of lots of
 different molecular bits like the fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. We're gonna
 focus in on the proteins - everything we eat has proteins and they come in a
 variety of shapes. Our bodies usually digest food proteins down to their most
 basic units, but some food proteins don't get completely broken down and they
 escape into the body where they meet the immune system. Now it's your immune system's job to recognize protein shapes that come from dangerous invaders - viruses,
 bacteria, things like that sneaking around your body. But peanut butter
 should not cause this reaction. This makes no sense. Cobras, jellyfish, really big wasps. Maybe. But not deliciously roasted
 legumes. Molecules called antibodies stick to the foreign food molecule
 leading to the release of a chemical called histamine. Which makes you really
 itchy, or if the reaction is bad enough, it can cause anaphylaxis - where the
 entire body just goes haywire. From dizziness to swelling to your ability to
 breathe. So I started looking up like can you just develop an almond allergy or a tree nut allergy as an adult - you can and I said
 well what could cause it. The only unusual thing was this almond milk, so I
 immediately made an appointment with an allergist. We needed to determine if
 almonds had specifically caused this allergic reaction. So honestly we did
 this food challenge and nothing happened. Nothing happened so you're sitting there
 now and you still have no idea what triggered this, what it really was, or
 what you might meet again that could give you a problem. And it could be
 nothing, it could be something else that I ate. Emily had an allergic reaction to
 something. In cases like these even doctors can be stumped. In the meantime
 he told me when I left the office that day that I needed to operate as though I
 had a life-threatening tree nut allergy. So he prescribed me epinephrine and
 I have an epinephrine injector that I have to carry with me everywhere. I
 have to spend the next year carrying this around with me, and maybe have to use it on some mystery food that we don't know. I keep coming
 back to one basic question, why would our bodies bother to have such extreme
 reactions? Reactions that could kill us after a handful of trail mix, or a glass
 of milk. The truth is we don't know why food allergies exist - there is a leading
 theory and I should stress this is just a theory, that allergies might
 exist thanks to parasites. The part of our immune system that recognizes
 allergy causing food also reacts to certain wormy, buggy infections.
 Humans are a lot cleaner than we used to be, back before hand sanitizer and indoor
 plumbing, and you know, science. Today we don't have as many parasites entering
 our bodies, so maybe that bit of our immune system is just bored - 
 so it's overreacting and attacking foreign-looking proteins in our food
 instead. Our clean, sterile, no dirt eating lifestyles could be behind the rise in
 allergies of all kinds. But that's just a theory, a parasite... wait that's not my catchphrase What am i doing? Peanut allergies are the most common food allergy, affecting nearly 1 in 40 kids in
 the US. In all, we know of at least 400 proteins for more than a hundred and
 seventy foods that cause allergic reactions with eight foods
 accounting for 90% of those. Now a lot of people are allergic to shrimp and other
 shellfish, and a lot of those people are also allergic to little bugs called dust
 mites. Now shrimp shellfish and dust mites are all invertebrates and all of
 them trigger allergies thanks to a protein called tropomyosin. Well they
 share that protein and it's very different from anything our bodies make.
 This is an example of cross reactivity, like if you're allergic to cashews you
 might also be allergic to pistachios or mangos since they're all in the same
 plant family. I'm telling you evolution explains everything. So how can you avoid
 food allergies for you or your kids? Well, just a decade or two ago doctors
 recommended not giving young kids foods that commonly trigger allergies for at
 least the first few years of their life. But that was actually the exact wrong
 advice. Food allergy rates continued to rise, so doctors changed their
 recommendations. Today's advice suggests parents should slowly introduce common
 allergic foods early, and in small amounts - and it seems like it's working.
 Food allergy rates have stopped rising at least. I mean we're parents now mm-hmm
 How does your having an allergy affect what you're introducing your chile
 - if it were up to me I probably would be incredibly more wimpy about it,
 but my wife my wife is introducing all these things. She introduced all the all the nuts to her so far and she's not allergic.
 So yeah, and I got nervous every time.  Which is fine. 
 If you already have a food allergy, unfortunately there's no cure. We're
 developing treatments like getting the immune system accustomed to allergy
 causing foods in small doses, there's even a sticker that acts almost like a
 nicotine patch for peanut allergy. But please remember always talk to a doctor
 before you attempt any treatment. Sadly with food allergies there's still more questions than there are answers. We know what's causing them, we know a little bit about how to prevent them, but we don't know why they
 exist or how to cure them. It's really stressful to not know what caused it
 and to not have any reliable way of testing what caused it. You take for
 granted when you don't have a food allergy - you can go wherever you want
 ready to eat anything and so you're automatically your world like shrinks
 quite a bit. Every restaurant you go to, every lunch that you eat, if you didn't
 prepare it yourself I'm wondering like is this gonna have something in it that
 could kill me? And am I allergic to almonds? And if it's not almonds then what is it?
 Are people taking me seriously. That's a big concern that people who have food
 allergies. But, it can be life-threatening.
 Is it frustrating that people can't give you an answer about why this happened.
 Yes, yes I would love a cure that would be great. Do you've a cure are you gonna introduce? A cure, well it's called exposure therapy.
 But every scientific question that we know the answer to today was once a
 mystery just like this an answer barely out of reach, in the fog of not knowing
 yet. Someday we'll figure it out. Some nuts
 are just tougher to crack than others. Stay curious."

-1,"Recently there has been
 a lot of talk about measles. What does measles actually do,
 and should you vaccinate against it? Or is this just hysteria? Measles is a virus: a hull of proteins, RNA, plus some more proteins for reproduction. It cannot reproduce by itself;
 it needs a host cell to do so. To understand measles, we have to
 understand the immune system. You might already have seen the visual system we developed
 to help here. Now, let’s focus on the parts of
 the immune system relevant to measles. The measles virus enters humans
 through the nose, mouth, or eyes. The measles infection starts in the lungs. Measles is especially good at infecting
 the body’s first line of defence: macrophages, powerful guard cells
 that protect the lungs from intruders. They enter a cell and take it over. The virus reprograms the cell and transforms it into a dangerous
 virus production center. Once a cell is filled with viruses, they leave the crippled cell
 and begin the cycle over again. But the immune system has
 powerful weapons against virus infections: natural killer cells. These cells basically patrol the body
 and check other cells for infections. If they find an infected cell,
 they order it to commit suicide. This is so effective that for
 the first 10 days or so, you will not even notice that
 you’re infected with measles. And now, the reason why measles
 is so powerful. After a period of fighting and dying, macrophages alert the brain of the
 immune system: the dendritic cells. The job of the dendritic cells is
 to collect samples of intruders, travel to the lymph nodes, and then activate the heavy weapons that eradicate the infection very fast
 in a team effort. But the measles virus uses
 a dreadful tactic. It infects the dendritic cells and uses them as a Trojan horse
 to enter deeper into the body. The infected cells travel to the next 
 lymph node to alert other immune cells. Once it arrives, the measles virus spreads around the
 virgin T and B cells and infects them. It attacks the very system that
 evolved to fight it. Now, things happen very fast. The lymph system spreads the virus
 everywhere and it enters the bloodstream, infecting cells while traveling. Measles infects organs like the spleen, the liver, the intestines,
 and, most importantly, the lungs. The symptoms range from a very high fever, headache, sickness,
 bronchitis, and, of course, a rash. In the lungs, the immune system was
 doing pretty okay. But now, millions of viruses
 attack a second time and kill countless cells, wiping out
 the defense systems. In this phase, you start coughing out
 millions of measles viruses. Measles is so contagious at this stage, that if you meet someone
 who isn’t vaccinated, there’s about a 90% chance
 you’ll infect them. Without the protective army in the lungs,
 other bacteria or viruses that would usually not stand a chance can
 now enter the lungs and develop into harmful parallel infections that
 can cause pneumonia, the most common way to
 die from measles. Your body’s immune system is now
 seriously wounded. Various protective systems are hurt
 and disrupted. The virus spreads everywhere, infecting
 the skin all over the body. The typical measles rash now
 becomes visible. And in some cases, the measles virus reaches the brain and causes
 a brain infection. If it does so, the chances of dying
 are between 20 to 40 percent, and there may be long-term damage. But your body is far from giving
 up at this stage, and it fights back agressively. Some dendritic cells survive
 long enough to activate the anti-virus forces of the body. Plasma cells in the lymph nodes
 start producing billions of antibodies, tiny proteins that mark infected cells
 for destruction or clump the virus together. Killer T cells flood the body
 and kill infected cells left and right. After 2 to 3 weeks, the body usually gets the upper hand and overwhelms
 the infection. But the immune system is now
 seriously weakened, and may take weeks or months to recover, leaving the body vulnerable
 to other diseases. But, if you make it, you are now immune: the immune system remembers
 the virus forever. Measles is no joke. Although 84% of all humans are
 vaccinated against measles, 122,000 people died because
 of the infection in 2014. Some people cannot get vaccinations, either because they’re too young,
 because of chemotherapy or HIV, or because they’re allergic
 to the vaccine. They need the rest of us to
 stop the disease for them. The measles vaccination is
 safe, cheap, and available. There are no benifits from having
 measles at all. You don’t strengthen your immune
 system and it’s not more natural. Most people who don’t vaccinate
 only want the best for their children, which is honorable. But if you ask yourself, “Am I putting the life of my child
 and other children at risk by not vaccinating against measles?” The sad answer is yes. Yes, you are. Let’s not play the blame game, though. Let’s work together and
 eradicate this virus. Together, we can get rid of these
 dreadful monsters and consign them to their rightful place:

person but we kind of lost that knowingly part and now we just have sort of romantic fantasies just look at the romantic poetry and romantic art and romantic films needing modern stuffing though all of those genres and they tell you if you can make yourself feel better by loving someone and a lot of people suffer as a result of that so true love I would say true love is are you feeling content are you feeling free are you feeling that you yourself are good enough if the answer to those questions is yeah yeah I think that's true love true love I think is connection so that's how Nina I am Perrineau your blend Co Antonio Blanco hey Russell first time post I guess wouldn't want to ask you it I'm all have no delusions of when in the back do you think there's only one for all of us because I've been trying to find someone and I keep getting screwed am I done I'll come on having a plan Cody Dallas which no I don't think there is one I think that she you probably love that person a lot but things sometimes have a timeframe that's expired and transpired and you should probably accept it or maybe you know there may be resolution you may get back with that person but either way the important thing I think is not to place as we've been discussing in this episode your inner peace of tranquility your completion your sense of yourself in the hands or heart of another so is inevitably will form through relationship attachment and love acknowledge that if you've got pattern of doing that to an extreme it will be damaging for you and that's be what you're experiencing so don't not only reason I think what there is is you yourself arriving at a place where you're able to have successful relationships people something I'm working on still and hopefully I'm getting better at so and what that meant is one other thing got done in order to do that was letting go of the idea of the one because I think then we get attached to or people that are kind of dramatic and exciting to happen look this is so really good for the mystic common peace companionship fun jewelry tranquility but for people that are very sort of some scintillating cinematic experience gee said how can I increase my sexual confidence without feeling like I'm lowering my intellect to fit social standard you mean by sexual competence we want to be confident more than having sex or confident about who you are having sex with or the type of sexuality I get what you mean you feel shy we know in sectors where I'm reducing from this to my bad it's like just go when I lost me erection or whatever it is you have to do if you're a woman in that situation only it just found it so a bit shy help us now because if you can't ask people who publish and benefit from anyway Russell my name is Nicole do you have any kids with some experiencing anxiety I'm pregnant my first shot very nervous about doing Bridal to have a healthy princely child I know the stretch is not help you though I love your channel thanks your time you'll be alright and I think it's probably natural for early in pregnancy you feel nervous and anxious but you will be very precious to protect so I think accepts these feelings that resists the feeling anxious and them feel anxious about very anxious remarks or bankers as okay I'm still me talk to other people about it and don't be lonely and good luck the affinity you'll be like Nicole James Montgomery hi Russell I was wondering how to find like-minded people and true friends I've been a small to medium sized town there's blue-collar and economically depressed and being a young creative guy I find difficult to relate to in and around me let alone befriend them do you have authentic friends with a great support system I feel alone and ambitious among the walking dead and the pinna mystic that's very poetic mate and it probably in some respect to be extremely good for your creativity you should probably continue to write about it but if you don't want to continue to feel down move and also look to create connections with like my people yeah I do create connections like minded people I don't define myself really around creativity more around emotional vulnerability a lot creatively born a lot of funny people but I think probably where I shall see my truth is sort of in the fact that I'm vulnerable so all them people wandering around in your blue collar medium-sized economically depressed counting I have that as well they're not okay but it is my course they're still feeling those feelings that you feel what you define yourself as what artistic pursuits could you be making I think community is certainly very important and you should find ways of connecting to people or moving to another place if you really feel like I just don't like these people but I feel like everything you need is around noon world hi Russell I was wondering to get any advice for an eighteen-year-old ADA will students find it very hard to find purpose in life and to make meaningful connections with people go to a very monocultural school and don't show the same interests as a lot of others such as shoes clothes and sport makes me feel like I don't fit in or belong anywhere and we know it's a few of these inquiries about people feeling like they don't fit in anywhere so was like perhaps a lot of people that I feel that when I was a kid I don't see in like everybody else and I think these are kind of natural feelings now reach out in different directions openly and honestly find things that you care about and pursue those things and be willing to step off of the pathway of your life a little bit only you can really find this path yourself I mean I thought that well I really like West and to start going to West them and make friends with them or I'm really into the Smith so go like a fish memorabilia auction and just go people this is good isn't it pursue with passion your particular interest and be open about them Joseph Campbell would say follow your belief interest is at your fingertips new world rich just reach out in any direction honestly and openly be led by your passion biobliss well that's um true news views we've used I don't we've enjoyed listening to me saying this stuff and the subtle echo has gone in the corner of the room reminding us that we are connected by infinite vibration and by unseen energy the steps will never understand with our limited consciousness because our capacity to understand is like a cup limited whereas potential knowledge and information like the universe itself is infinite subscribe to you know Institute that is a beautiful and filling it out I can use tools like to know this knows what how I want some tools like a Patrol
-1,"the number of measles cases linked to the Disneyland theme park continues to grow doctors weigh-in and sound the alarm vaccines are one of the greatest achievements in the history of public health we thought we had measles essentially licked so why is this disease coming back from the brink of extinction people are deciding they're afraid of vaccines and that fears putting the nation's health at risk how did we get to this point where personal belief is more powerful than science they get this monster shot we vaccinated our baby and something happened but someone's already sucked into that myth it's a very difficult thing to talk them out of it the greatest medical news in history dr. Jonas Salk discovers a vaccine that promises to wipe out childhood crippling and killing enemy polio in the 1950s the Salk vaccine was greeted with open arms polio smallpox diphtheria no longer a threat in the u.s. because of vaccines and in 2000 another watershed moment the CDC reports the measles practically wiped out tonight in the United States but that report proved overly optimistic measles are back more than 600 cases were reported in the u.s. in 2014 and another disease that looked like it was disappearing a generation ago is also making a comeback whooping cough unlike measles it's return is in part attributed to the waning effectiveness of its vaccine but it shows how the spread of a disease can impact the most vulnerable the risk of whooping cough may sound like something from the past but it's still very real today California reported more than 4,200 cases nine people have died all of them infants for San Francisco mother Mariah Bianchi those numbers are more than just statistics when her son was born in August 2005 as a nurse she realized something was wrong it was just like he was so lethargic and I knew that there was just something I'm like I can't keep him like he went to the doctor and she said I want you to go to the hospital as soon as he got there he went into cardiac arrest what she didn't realize was that the immunity from her own whooping cough vaccine had worn off and she'd infected her newborn who was too young to be inoculated and they started CPR right away for probably about 45 minutes or so as a nurse I'm thinking I know what that means your brain is not getting oxygen your body is failing and the surgeon came out and he said his chance of survival is very we made the most compassionate decision you could but we just said no don't don't do it just stop Dillon Bianchi died 17 days after he was born vulnerable people like newborns depend on the immunity of those around them to protect them from dangerous diseases to keep measles from spreading for example about 94% of a community needs to be vaccinated it's called herd immunity in some areas that's a concern here in Marin County California you have pockets of people who are not vaccinating their children there are certain schools and communities where that rate is as high as 50 percent and what I fear is that we have an epidemic of measles and outbreak and that we have children that are very ill or they die the measles vaccine has been so effective it doesn't seem like something we need to protect our children from you have this sort of fundamental paradox of vaccines that they've become a victim of their own success Saif manukan examines the fear of vaccines in his book the panic virus the current vaccine scares and controversies that were still dealing with today stem from a 1998 paper that appeared in The Lancet a very respected medical journal published out of the UK the paper written by dr. Andrew Wakefield claimed there might be a connection between the measles mumps rubella vaccine and autism in his press conference Andrew Wakefield stood up and said parents should not give their children the MMR vaccine period until we are able to get to the bottom of this the MMR vaccination in combination that I think that it should be suspended in favor of the single vaccines the notion that you would take a 12-person case study and make claims about a population as a whole is ridiculous this paper was historically bad and what the media and in the UK did was they ran with that it's a dilemma you know that's a sensational story follow-up studies of hundreds of thousands of children could not find any evidence that the MMR vaccine causes autism and investigations into Wakefield's original paper revealed he distorted the data and acted unethically he's lost his medical license The Lancet paper has been retracted but he had very effectively positioned himself as a murderer and in some odd way every piece of evidence that comes out against Wakefield sort of solidifies to standing in the community that still pays attention to him another reason fears about vaccine safety persisted is that complicated science proved difficult for public health institutions to communicate case in point their response when concerns were raised over a vaccine preservative called --them aerosol which contains ethyl mercury that's right mercury a known neurotoxin but ethyl mercury inflam aerosol is not the same as the toxic methyl mercury which is found in fish and accumulates in the body nevertheless the Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the marisol be removed and their messaging backfired in 1999 health officials denied a link between vaccines and the autism epidemic yet urge vaccine makers to take out the mercury just to be safe what the American Academy of Pediatrics said is we are recommending this step so we can make safe vaccines even safer as a parent if you tell me something safe I don't think that's on a sliding scale I assume that if you say it's safe it is safe for my child it's not safe safer safest there are almost two languages here there's the language of science and then there's English and in the language of science you have these signifiers like to the best of our knowledge as far as we know based on the available scientific evidence because you can't say anything with a hundred percent you can't prove a negative and so when scientists speak in their language and the rest of us translate that into English it sounds like they're saying something very different than they're saying based on what we know right now we don't think that there is an association but that's not saying with a hundred percent certainty there isn't one that is saying that based on the evidence that we have right now we don't think that there is one either because the reporter doesn't understand what's actually going on or because they're looking to generate a story they then take that and make it seem as if the scientist is saying I think there's a possibility that vaccines do cause autism well in fact that's not it at all news organizations should exercise judgment about what goes out over there err Brendan Nyhan is a professor at Dartmouth College who studies how misinformation spreads and the role of the media what's particularly important is to think about the overall scientific consensus where is the weight of the evidence and is our reporting reflecting that or not that's what's often gone astray in the vaccine debate it's time for everyone to redirect the questions toward finding the cause of autism it is not however vaccinations controversial subject is not controversial but controversial for parents who still believe not controversial Matt it's time for kids to country every day people can't be fact-checkers for every story about vaccines and the journalists don't give people the weight of the scientific evidence they're letting them down she got her vaccinations she ran a low-grade fever she got a little rash and then she stopped talking a false sense of balance was also created when scientific evidence was equated with people's personal experiences reporting fell into this on the one hand on the other hand fallacy this notion that if you have two sides that are disagreeing that means that you should present both of them with equal weight we've vaccinated our baby and something happened that's it Jenny McCarthy's had more to do with popularizing the notion that vaccines are dangerous than any other single person in the United States we begin of course with Jenny McCarthy the actress and entertainment personality her son Evan has autism she's very smart she's telegenic looking it's plain and simple it's no it's yes it is excuse me when I look at clips of her it's a completely unfair fight my science is named Evan and he's at home that's my son Jenny McCarthy has said many times and often as very loudly that you know her child is her scientific fact any scientists or any science reporter who's familiar with how science works would say that no any one person is an anecdote and the plural of anecdote is not data you know it's just a story but stories are powerful while vaccination rates are high nationwide there are some religious and ethnic enclaves and communities where well-educated upper middle class people live where a vaccine hesitancy runs strong I was interviewing an epidemiologist and he said oh yeah we completely know we're gonna have communities that have issues with vaccine uptake if we take a map and stick a pin wherever there's a Whole Foods and draw a circle around it and that's where we're gonna have problems he was obviously being facetious exasperated health officials are trying to come up with new ways to communicate with the public Brendan Nyhan conducted a study and watched how hesitant parents reacted when they were shown information from the cdc website stating there's no evidence the MMR vaccine causes autism the good news was it did cause parents to be less likely to believe in the myth that the MMR vaccine causes autism the bad news is however that it made them less likely to say they would vaccinate a child which is precisely the opposite of what we would hope to see what we found is that telling people the correct information wasn't actually effective that may mean we've reached the point where public health officials in the media can't even talk about vaccine safety without it backfiring but fears generated by the latest measles outbreak may help people understand more clearly the value of vaccines and what's at stake what does it take how many times do you have to tell people or talk about it we all have a role in helping each other to protect each other a vaccine preventable disease should not have killed my son Oh"
0,"so while after you eat these meals you have energy but the energy lasts a very short period of time and you're hungry much sooner and then you have to eat again and then you have to eat again and then you have to eat again it is a lot cheaper to go eat fast food that meaning it definitely you can buy a hamburger for cheaper than you can buy an apple that's very sad so you tell them you have to pay more in order to eat healthy you pay less in order they get that and to make you rich so for something I might die over it's unbelievable the poorest people in our country are the fattest people there's we've done something completely wrong on a Sunday afternoon in a New Orleans supper the Bucktown seafood festival is getting underway Bucktown is a tiny fishing village that has been here for more than 150 years it was almost completely destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 but it hasn't lost its touch for what it does best food is a big part of the culture in New Orleans and they tend to use a lot of deep fried foods and heavy sauces they'll tell you that while people in other places may eat to live here they actually live to eat with ruolan's most of my food begins with what we call a room in a roux is a combination of flour and oil and that's the basis for most of our sauces and as a result there's a lot of fat that's in the basic foods that we make from the soups to Gumbo's to your a two-phase how important is food to the culture down here it's what we live off of what I would you take the food away and just the city would die it's all about food and drink around here you know it's a certain way we do seafoods you know in a certain way we fry they like you guys behind it the way they fry where we take whole onions and you know if we fry all kind of stuff and make it taste good with the extra spice and then there are the extra kick that can't be good for you we can't be but it tastes good have you ever seen anyone eat one of those you know when I was younger I used to be able to eat one I couldn't touch 1/2 on one now it's a big sandwich the high fat deep-fried food culture here is delicious but has deadly consequences pressure and heart disease are major killers Wendy O'Neill was born in New Orleans after Katrina she says it's even more difficult to access good food let's see McDonald's for breakfast McDonald's for lunch McDonald's for dinner we ate McDonald's all the time we ate the trashiest stuff for Sidney impastato weight has always been an issue he's down now to 170 kilos from nearly 200 it's been a difficult challenge for his family to endure somehow we see an internal medicine doctor who has a plan that we can go to and but you know the prescriptions that he really needs we can't afford and the the specialist we can't afford to see the kidney specialist and so that's it's not a good situation I don't want to be the fat guy that was just another typical fat guy who died and well we loved him I wish she would've lost weight he would have been skinny and he would have lived I don't want to be that guy dawn has reached the point with Sidney is he believes an operation that would constrict his stomach with a band may be his best hope but no insurance company will give him coverage because his obesity is considered a pre-existing condition you know it is a radical approach but if he can't get it soon his body will be will not be strong enough to even have that done Don Sidney on alone consider the facts two out of every three Americans are overweight that number is expected to rise to three out of four by 2020 the United States is the world's baddest developed nation with an obesity rate double of that in many European countries one in three Americans is expected to have diabetes by 2050 minorities have been even more profoundly affected blacks of a 50% higher prevalence of obesity in Hispanics 25% higher wood compared with whites so how did it get this way obesity rates have been going up very rapidly in the United States but really only since about 1980 before that they were constant for decades a change in the way our federal agriculture policy worked which went from paying farmers not to grow food to paying farmers to grow as much food as they possibly could and the result of that was an enormous increase in the amount of food available in the country for consumption portion sizes went up as well best food servings are two to five times what they used to be this is the signature Burger King story Times Square in New York this particular mill has somewhere around 3,600 calories look at the size it would take around 18 hours of exercise to burn off this many calories I mean I still remember there was a Coke machine in the teachers lounge of my elementary school and it had these itty-bitty little bottles I think they probably were eight ounce bottles of coke and now I mean it's the average portion that you see if you went into like a convenience store would probably be a 20 ounce bottle that's sold as a single serving American food policy doesn't happen in isolation there are many moving parts that make up a complex puzzle large government agencies multinational corporations and of course lobbyists who try to shape the country's food policy as it comes out of Washington for the government to try to force changes to dictate to consumers in a free society what they do is not there's not a good record of that being successful all of this goes back to Congress and if you want to do something about public health in Amer what you really need to do is to change election campaign laws so that these big corporations aren't paying for congressional elections that's the source of corruption in American government two out of every three food stores in Harlem is what's known as a bodega now these aren't grocery stores they're more like corner convenience stores so rather than having fresh meat and fresh vegetables they tend to have a lot of processed foods sugary foods and especially sodas the city of New York has identified sodas and other sugar sweetened beverages is one of the main causes of obesity in an attempt to improve health and decrease consumption the city is requested it to year ban on allowing recipients of food stamps or snap to purchase the drinks the SNAP program is really not designed to purchase a person's entire diet but it's designed to give them more money so that they can afford nutritious foods and I don't think anyone in this country would argue that sugar sweetened beverages are nutritious foods while the request is being considered by the Department of Agriculture the beverage industry is fighting back it'll add $5 to these drinks that's not pennies that's serious money New York has fought a similar battle once before and lost when it tried to implement a soda tax earlier this year we can't afford no to the beverage tax the American Beverage Association spent more than 10 million dollars on their ad campaign defeating the bill people are entitled to treat themselves at a certain level they treat themselves with government money by their own by all means because soda is not the sole culprit of obesity and if you're gonna pinpoint what are the culprits obesity we're gonna have to eliminate maybe 60% of products we sell in our supermarkets today what about people say great eliminate them well then you have to do that across the board but the American food landscape is going to be totally different than what we know it today one drink per salt the supermarket is chubby imported from the Caribbean the manufacturer of the drink boasts that it was developed to target children and that it fits snugly in the palm of a child's hand the US has no rules or laws of ravenna soda from being marketed to children industry backers liked it that way an exciting new category in the soft drink industry was created when chubby was developed to target children that's a terrible idea but here I mean when was the last time you were able to see little Chubby's first of all Chubby's in washington DC it small little Chubby's this is the kind of poor practice that shouldn't be occurring should be regulated should be regulated yeah that's about seven donuts worth of sugar in there so see it doesn't they don't just the nutritional information on the bottle oh well then it's on the container if it's on the package otherwise it's not illegal to be sold United States I don't know where you got it tell me if I've got that in Washington DC okay why suspect you should probably do can call their own traditional information off their website okay 32 34 I'm not sure then depending on the place I'm just not gonna defend it that's a terrible practice should it be regulated should be regulated should children be protected from that protected that's what parents are for for many Americans economic times have never been worse but for fast food companies they've never been better while one in eight Americans rely on food stamps the stalks of taco bell/pizza hut Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's are at all-time highs for consumers stretching their recession dollars to buy healthy food has been tough especially when chains like Little Caesars offer a large pizza for only 5 bucks or the McDonald's McDouble their double cheeseburger goes for just $2 your mother gives you 5 dollars you want to make that stretch anything you're going to McDonough's you're gonna make that when you gave me some fries then I'm gonna get you something to drink that way you still have a lease of dollars to the maybe buy you some chips a little later growing up I had home economics in school and so they taught you what a healthy plate look like you have a starch a protein a vegetable and I think that's the information that children don't have and because they see in their environment unhealthy food and they see it's cheaper it's being consumed by everybody they don't think about an alternative but if you gave them the education maybe they would have the information to make the alternative choice the healthier choice at the Thurgood Marshall lower Academy an elementary school on 151st Street an experiment is underway to fight back against the array of bad food choices in the community dr. logic a Williams is a neurologist at Harlem Hospital he's developed a program that harnesses the power of hip hop music to teach children about healthy food choices hip hop is is the social epidemic and wants to use hip hop is is the life form amongst the youth one thing to program teachers is menu board literacy the ability to read a food label that ranges on the menu board they're inches and sizes and and it's very very complicated to your grandparents to your friends and about calories dr. Williams knows that the odds are stacked against them nearly half the children in Harlem are overweight or obese and this message has to be not a well-oiled well-funded fast-food industry that spent 4.2 billion dollars on advertising last year we are up against an incredible enemy for lack of a better words you know fast food industry makes money little small programs trying to make a difference in our city one block at a time one sweep at its ninth one neighborhood at a time if we can succeed here in a parliament we can pretty much succeed in any tough neighborhood across the world it's media day at the white house internalists from around the world are clamoring to see Michelle Obama's kitchen garden she's decided to make healthy eating and exercise the centerpiece of her role is First Lady we have to eliminate food deserts in this country and we need to do it now you don't need to travel far from the White House just a few miles to find what Michelle Obama describes as a food desert plenty of liquor stores but no fresh food southeast DC has one of the worst obesity rates in the country the food that you put in your body can either heal you or kill you on a Saturday morning the ward eight farmers market is a small oasis in an otherwise barren food landscape Lauren Vanderpool a Washington DC native and vegan chef is giving a demonstration teaching residents how to make a raw food salad are released into the water I was born in Washington DC I was raised in a food desert you know and people just don't know people just don't know they haven't been exposed they haven't left South East they're used to what they've been exposed to and what they've been exposed to is liquor stores corner stores and carry-outs chicken wings with mumbo sauce hot chips with blue juices if all else fails you and you can't find the small jugs of the blue juice we always have access to the gallon look at that so that's a gallon of blue juice no mountain artificially colored and artificially flavored how would you describe the the health of people who live in environments like this where we are right now in DC which is South East Ward 8 is statistically the most obese place in the country there's something wrong with that being in the nation's capital something extremely wrong with that what I find is that when you're eating foods and there are no nutrients in it you're going to want to eat more because your body is not recognizing the nutrients that you're needing so you're going to keep on eating your body's intelligence says let me keep on eating to try to get some of these nutrients but you're not getting any of it because you're eating fried foods you're eating dead foods you're eating foods that have no life this is the United States Department of Agriculture or USDA it represents the American food industry everything from small farmers to chain restaurants and in doing so it helps them sell more food but it also puts out the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and for a nation facing an obesity epidemic eating less food could be the only way out so how can this one department represent these conflicting interests the USDA whose historic role has been to promote American agribusiness is now also in the position of promoting healthful diets and that was never a problem before obesity became a problem it was all the and dietary advice needed to change to encourage people to eat less that the USDA came into conflict and those conflicts have played out over the years an example well the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which is the advice that the government gives the people about what to eat it never says heedless of anything I worked very hard on setting up the first review process for those to be sure that scientific authorities were calling the shots John bode was the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for food and consumer services during the 1980s now he's a lobbyist representing clients like Kraft Foods and McDonald's it's what's known as the revolving door between the food industry and the government agencies meant to regulate it for example michael taylor was an executive at the agricultural giant Monsanto before taking a senior post at the Food and Drug Administration or Catherine woteki who left the USDA in 2001 and later joined Mars the candy company that makes skittles and M&Ms and then was brought back by President Obama this year to the USDA and so the revolving door that causes some concern that's understandable the notion that our government officials would one day be a government official in the next day basically selling their influence and so stepping out for a year I think that makes good sense it does I mean this has been extended and so there they're no longer they're no longer yeah well do you know what they are they I'm sorry I don't feel comfortable trying to recite what they are now listen up America the cheesy bites pizza is back in 2007 Pizza Hut came out with cheesy bites pizza as you'd expect it's high in calories and saturated fat what you may not suspect is that some of the support for it came from a surprising source a trade group overseen by the USDA is there a conflict of interest when you're representing the cheese industry and you're representing the nutritional interest of Americans well I wouldn't presume to speak to that because that's not my particular area of expertise I will tell you that the Food and Nutrition Service a part of USDA that tries to encourage healthy eating in a school setting I has never taken it more seriously than we do today we pressed Julie Paradiso about this several times today the USDA is celebrating the opening of a salad bar at an elementary school in Washington DC it's a step in the right direction for a school system that has one of the highest obesity rates in the country forty-three percent of the students here are either obese or overweight this is very very atypical of what you see in the school system you know mostly it's processed high in sugar foods qahal Armstrong is an executive chef and owner of a local four-star restaurant he took an interest in school food when the White House chef personally asked him to make a visit yeah we visited Tyler Elementary on Capitol Hill and we went into the cafeteria and went into the refrigerators in the freezer and inside the freezer they had this box of turkey sandwiches you know this turkey sandwich for breakfast and it had about a hundred ingredients in it we were so shocked I took a photograph of the ingredients that were on the label wait turkey sandwiches like meat meat and bread the last time I checked and bread has four ingredients sometimes five so if then the kids why do they do this this student makes a food cheaper that brusky was shocked at what he found when he volunteered in his daughter's elementary school cafeteria so I went in and expecting to see food cooked from scratch and here comes all these frozen beef crumbles and tater tots I started taking pictures of the food for a new blog so the parents could see what their kids were eating it was mostly processed food that's partially because the USDA diverts raw excess food to large companies that return it to schools in the form of patties pizzas and Nuggets it's all about money and you know the so called value-added products where corporations can somehow get between you and you no real farm products and whip it into something that they can make money off of I mean that's really what it boils down to our health versus their money works part-time at a private school in Washington teaching children how to cook and enjoy food you seen real changes in the DC public school system less sugary foods and more fruits and vegetables my feeling is if school food is important because we're perpetuating a culture of junk food that is literally making kids sick the US government says the current generation could be the first in history to have a shorter lifespan than their parents the forces driving the obesity spike in America may be complex but they're not unknown the question is who's profiting from the current situation clearly not the children I think it comes down to money and I think it's a complicated multi-layered problem and I think it's something that's perpetuated itself throughout the years especially for people of color to be in a very poor urban area is not exactly a choice your money dictates that you need to live there and the same thing with what you buy to eat you buy this within your means the economics of our food structure are completely working against public health I mean you almost couldn't have designed a worse environment where you take your least healthy products things that are high in sugar and fat and salt and highly processed and you make them significantly less expensive than your most healthy products and a lot of families do are just in that financial situation where cheap food is so heavily subsidized so falsely inexpensive that they just don't know any better you know and I tell you once they once they find out what we've done with with their food system what we're due to their children hopefully they'll be open arms about it"
0,I want to first say that what I'm going to talk to you about today is theory not yet fact it's my best interpretation of what's going on in the body with water collaborating with light to do magical things it's not yet proven but I'm hoping research in the future will in fact verify that I'm right so I want to start with a little bit of a metaphor you look at a street in streets but provide the highways they connect the houses together people can travel you deliver goods but there's also power lines along the edges of many streets we don't see them we don't really aren't aware of them but they're of course providing electricity to all the homes and the businesses when you get into the house you see the walls they're providing structure for the house but the power lines are coming in and going inside those walls and they're going over to a plug where you plug in a computer and charge it up you take that for granted but the walls they're providing structure but they're also providing there the path by the conduit by which the electricity reaches the plug and therefore your devices it there's something similar going on in the body the body of course has this massive blood network that supplies Goods takes away waste products does very important things for the body but it's also a supply of the electrical circuit for the for the body and each individual cell has a cytoskeleton this is gives it structure gives it strength so it doesn't get smashed but that cytoskeleton is also a source of electricity the electricity coming in off of the network traveling through the cytoskeletal fibers to provide electricity to the internal of the cell so here's a schematic of a simple cell and this cell you can see these plus signs throughout going along these cytoskeleton pathways and those are protons and they're coming in from the outside but who's making those protons be available that's the structured water it surrounds the cell and the cell works very hard to maintain that structured water and when there's sunlight it will grow and that will make more energy but the plus signs are gathering along the edge along the interface of the structured water with the unstructured water outside of it and they can be channeled up into these caviola these little caves and then brought right into the cytoskeleton to provide those positive charges to certain organelles in the cell that need positive charge and in particular one of those is the lysosome lysosomes need to be extremely acidic in order to do their job and their job is to clear molecular debris very very important get rid of the garbage as they draw in these plus signs these protons they get lowered lower pH and now they can do their job if that electrical circuit is not supplying enough protons they can't do their job the debris gathers up and you get things like Alzheimer's disease from amyloid beta plaque there's also the mitochondria those are their source of energy for the cell they make the ATP and they also depend on protons to supply a lower pH in their intracellular membrane compared to the pH in the interior world they need that pH drop to drive the generation of the ATP that supplies energy for the cell what I'm saying in the most important thing in this talk is that structured water that is maintained outside the cell it's a special gel form of water it's not liquid it's not solid and it also induces this charge separation that creates a battery and what happens then is that the cell uses those protons to go into the cytoskeleton to supply the positive charge and the electron stay inside the structured water and they provide energy for another very very important purpose probably other purposes as well but one that I'm very focused on is the synthesis of sulfate and the reason why this is important is because a sulfate actually maintains the gel each cell decorates its exterior with lots of sulfates that are attached to these extracellular matrix sugars outside the cell and those sulfates are really important for maintaining this structured water so it's circular they're made by the energy that the structured water creates when it responds to light and then they maintain the structured water so when that system falls apart lots of bad things happen so here's a picture a very schematic of red blood cells traveling through capillary they're very crowded in the capillary it's a very tight squeeze they decorate themselves with sulphate outside their cell and they deliver that sulfate as they pass through the capillary they shed it and they're if they're for shedding negative charge and that negative charge is then building up along the capillary wall and it's very interesting because as they do this by the time they get to the vein and all of them are shedding their negative charge this creates a battery between the artery and the vein which then actually propels the red blood cell through the artery through the capillary because it's attracted to the venous side because of this battery it's attracted to the cathode and that will pull the red blood cell through so that the heart doesn't have to work so hard to pump and furthermore these layers these sulfated layers along the wall of the capillary very slick thick jello the red blood cell can just slide through almost frictionless effort to get through that capillary when these things break down the red blood cell gets stuck and you have a no flow situation so basically this folded change that's created by the red blood cell itself actually drives the red blood cell through the capillary and makes the blood flow properly so here's a schematic from a paper that I've written with colleagues and what's really interesting is that when you think about a red blood cell negatively charged moving through a region that's going to create an electromagnetic field and the body can use that as a signal and in fact the body does very very important signal the wall of the capillary and of the arteries releases nitric oxide these little guys over here nitric oxide nitric oxide is very important in the blood because it relaxes the muscles and allows the blood to flow so it's really interesting that as the red blood cell moves it triggers the release of the nitric oxide which encourages further movement really interesting process so here's now a capillary cross-section of a red blood cell we're getting a little bit more into detail here we have a bunch of things that were pointing to you can see the negative charge surrounding the red blood cell that's actually cholesterol sulfate cholesterol is an important part of what makes the sulfate work and the red blood cell has these cholesterol molecules in its membrane with sulfates sticking out that gives it that negative charge and they shed it sheds those cholesterol sulfate molecules as it goes through they hop over to the other side and go into the endothelial cells providing them with both cholesterol and sulfate you can see I have these little sulfate molecules showing around the interior we've got a few endothelial cells wrapping it around and then they have this complicated glycosaminoglycans in their extracellular matrix that's all these little strings there that's the sugar chains those things have sulfates attached to them and that's what's making taining that structured water that easy water that's going to make everything work very very well and then of course you have the protons gathering along the inside there and you have this battery created within the structured water that can provide energy to the so this is my provocative proposal cholesterol sulfate supplies oxygen sulfur cholesterol energy and negative charge to all the tissues very very important list of things sulfate has four oxygen molecules so this is another way that the red blood cell can actually deliver oxygen to the tissues you know it has the oxygen bound to the hemoglobin but it can actually deliver the oxygen in the form of sulfate and of course the negative charge and then the energy are very very important sulfate is synthesized in the skin and in the red blood cells and in the platelets using the energy of sunlight so if you look at the veins on the back of your hand hold those up to the sunlight you'll be making lots of sulfate and that will be combined with cholesterol to make cholesterol sulfate and then that will end up making your cells very very happy and them and we believe the molecule that does this is the same molecule that makes the nitric oxide which is very very interesting that we have written two papers now this group claiming that endothelial nitric oxide synthase Eno's a very very interesting molecule can make can oxidize both sulfur and nitrogen and it chooses which one to oxidize based on the situation in the current environment is constantly monitoring the signals for example the electromagnetic signals to decide which one to make on a case-by-case moment-by-moment decision so the skin then is a solar-powered battery and we are able to use a sunlight for energy just as the plants are but we do it in this very different way that's actually going to provide us with you know what animals have which is mobility and a brain we have a nervous system plants don't have that they use the sunlight very differently so this is my bold claim deficiencies in cholesterol and sulfates applies to the blood and to the tissues of the most important factor behind modern diseases and I have looked at many many modern diseases and I can see that in many cases what's happening is the body is attacking a particular organ or an organ system in order to get at the sulfate that's there in order to give that sulfate to the blood because the blood is deficient if the blood doesn't flow the body doesn't work so that becomes a number-one priority and various organs get sacrificed and that will explain different kinds of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's and Otto so Eno's unfortunately is very vulnerable and this is why we face a problem right now it has a lot of dependencies it depends on vitamin b12 which is cobalamin that means it depends on cobalt it depends on iron because it has a heme group it depends of course on sulphur there's a zinc Maalik is in Katamon there of course oxygen glutathione the anti antioxidant glutathione and of course sunlight and so because enos is vulnerable to many different environmental toxins as well such as mercury aluminum and particularly glyphosate which is the one I've studied the most which is in the pervasive herbicide roundup that's pervasive in our environment in our food in our water roundup i think is causing a serious problem for enos which is causing us to have this massive sulphate deficiency so enos in fact is a site it's a member of this class of enzymes called cytochrome p450 enzymes which both aluminum and glyphosate have been shown to suppress so how to stay healthy eat a strictly certified organic diet my husband and i have been doing this only for the last three or four years when we first found out about glyphosate it has done wonders for our health we totally believe in it get lots of dietary sulfur that means great foods like broccoli garlic onions seafood liver for example if you can get a healthy liver get out in the sunlight as much as you can I love to take walks on the beach in the water you're getting everything there you're getting the grounding you're getting the sunlight and fresh air so really really useful to take a walk on the beach in the sunlight in summary the human body uses sunlight to make sulfate which maintains gelled water surrounding cells that gel water induces charge separation and that supplies electricity to the tissues sulfate is essential to prevent a no flow situation in the blood that's why the red blood cells can scoot through so so easily through the capillaries makes the heart sing because it has it doesn't have to work nearly so hard enos is a magical protein that makes sulfate in response to sunlight but it's hardly highly highly vulnerable to both deficiencies in certain nutrients and poisoning from various toxic chemicals especially roundup so the path to good health includes a sulfur rich organic diet loss of sunlight exposure and frequent grounding and then two things that I would like to see happen these that need to happen in my opinion of course there are many but these are my two top picks one is to confirm that I'm right about eNOS making sulfate because so far it's just a theory we have a detailed written up account of why we think this is happening but it hasn't been proven Nino's oxidizes both sulfur and nitrogen and depends which one on the environment to be able to control the blood flow and give the blood just right to be able to move the second one which I haven't mentioned but which I feel is very important I believe that glyphosate is getting into proteins by mistake in place of glycine glyphosate is a glycine molecule with an extra thing attached to the nitrogen I've written papers about this and I feel the evidence is really compelling but it has not been shown and I believe that chemists ought to be able to design an experiment which would show that this is in fact happening thank you very much
0,when Joe was little you know he was first he was like a little skinny little surfer boy always liked to be outside playing outside he loved to be outside to get him in the house it was hard he was a happy-go-lucky little kid always smiling he was like my little best friend he never showed any signs of trouble at all that we would have a pond you know later on in life with him I knew he had a drug-related problem I didn't know how bad it was but it was terrible he got worse and worse and to the point where I couldn't stand him anymore I didn't want him into my house I didn't like him here I didn't trust him he wasn't my son I don't know who he was he was the devil really that's all I can that's the best way to describe him he was overpowered by a demon by this drug you want to spend three to seven years in jail Joe you want to go to rehab for you what do you think sounds bad yeah and on fentanyl he was he was pretty out of it his body would get so relaxed that he looked like he was dead you know he would lay back and his mouth would just drop open and and it was it's pretty it's harrowing to watch your son go through this Joey Joe let's go Joe Joe it was a really hard but like I didn't want to leave him so I just couldn't like you know get my ground I want to make sure he was okay too I've overdosed twice the first time it had it be fentanyl the second time my overdose was straight fat no all the numbers putting on the radio listen to music and imma but and then boom I woke up in the ambulance my aspirations were a start a family and everything I mean that's what I was thinking about but it didn't happen drivers gone the way I just started doing Parker's hats every day progressed from doing percocets every day to doing dope every day I mean I always I knew fentanyl was in it I knew it was cut with it I started knowing when it was totally fentanyl my buddy told me it was it's just fat and all and I only went to him because it was more powerful and you get more bang for your buck it's pretty scary because most people don't see what I see every day I manage a Crematory in downtown Manchester and the Fenton all I noticed a lot the ogre doses were coming more quicker it was a lot more of them instead of getting one a week I could get three a week and I a lot of times when I went and picked these bodies up I wasn't sure I was going to go out and find my son so we would pop here a lot of times at night I would be parked here until after midnight one o'clock in the morning we came down here to watch for him to see if we saw him sitting on the sidewalk in a stupor or just walking down the street in a daze and there were times that we did sometimes he would see us and he would give us a signal like stay back other times he didn't see us at all and we would be like chasing after him it got worse as time went on we tried many different things with him we kicked him out to give him the tough love because people said give him tough love kick him out we kicked him out that made it worse he got into trouble I was sleeping at the Trap House trap house is where you can get anything you want there's multiple dealers in there I got arrested once for crack possession once for attempted burglary and that was in the same day and I also slept in the cemetery behind a mausoleum probably one of the hardest things I ever did to throw one of my own children out of out of my house that I always had a shelter for him because you didn't know what he was doing out there he didn't dare come back here because he knew he'd be arrested and I told him you come back and I'll call the police you'll be arrested I don't want you under here you get better and I'll be fine if you want help we'll get you help if you go back down there and keep doing that dope you're gonna die I said so what's up to you a new person now his wife and I are trying to you know basically if he went to a halfway house they would be doing the same thing you need to get a job you need to make phone calls you need to be more responsible it's time to basically change your ways and is it tough yes it's very tough and he has told me that every day is a challenge for him an addict alone is in its worst company so it's like my mind is racing constantly so I have to figure out stuff to do to keep him mind busy there's a lot of things go ahead you know and it's a constant battle feel guys like a war though psychological warfare that's best this time series is definitely different this time with his attitude and the way he's actually like stuck with things kind of is just like routine is different it's better than the last time when he came out of my rehab he went right back to it I write music I listen music it's more of like a way for me to get away from the world I mean I hate the world the way it is so I write about it like a dream I know that I see me to just keep on going I'm here like a dream better ways I know that I see I hope he is intensive outpatient program Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays from 8:00 to 11:00 on Friday my mom you know she is off so she takes me unless my wife's sleeping because my wife so she works like crazy hours so I wish I could just walk but she doesn't like me to walk she knows how I am she knows that I'll just go right on track I'm basically just trying to support him to stay strong and to end in love them I will always stand by him and try to help him you know stay strong for himself and fight this addiction I will always support him you know and remind him of things he should do and shouldn't do I know but it's your responsibility to make it a it okay they didn't have so well then you need to talk to them I'll help you yeah I need to do to them yeah you do I'm vulnerable I feel about my situation right now I feel like I'm vulnerable I mean 60 days it's still I'm still new to it all that challenge are not going and hanging out with people that are you saying hang out with it's like maybe like three four times a day and I'm up from 8:00 in the morning till you know we're 10:00 11:00 at night three four times a day I want to go down there yeah shame is a huge part of addiction for the families because with shame you don't want people to know because people do look down on you I didn't let my family my sisters know for a long time and my one of my sisters said god I wish you let me know I would have helped you I've borrowed money from them Joey has borrowed money from them he pawned everything he can get his hands on basically and cash for gold is where he pawned my wedding band is set to three times because he told us that he owed people money and the last time that he pawned it I didn't have my rings back for a whole year I thought they lived we didn't have food we were ashamed you know we didn't want anyone to know our story every day he would go to his mother's work she'd give him money and more money and more money and he had more lives she called cried to me one day and she says I've given him everything she said all my credit cards are maxed and they want but they have money I said how much do you need how much have you given because she kept it from me she lied to me my wife lied to me first time so then I knew there was a real problem I never my wife never lied to me and she didn't want to tell me because I screamed I said don't give him any money you understand I used to scream every day don't give him any money you call me you tell me I'll take care of it but they gave him the money until it was all gone sometimes you and I are running scared through this life when we have no reason to be when you have Jesus you have everything that you need what I did to my family has been the hardest dealing with just because they're still there and it's like why how are you still proud that I'm your son how are you still proud to say I'm amazing you and I have a hurt world all around us looking for encouragement our neighbors are desperate to see us apply real love to real needs of real people in the real world he is starting to come back to us I see a lot of the old Joe a lot of the younger Joe in him we are you know he likes to laugh a lot now I think something clicked maybe that switch went on in his head and maybe he wants to change maybe he saw the light maybe somebody came down maybe some I don't know but right today is my son is back again this is me this is who I am this is what I want to be I think I can do it I feel like we can do it I'm not gonna say that I got this it's still worth saying you can say you never got it you
0,"(♪♪) >> Mark: Tonight on the Fifth Estate. (♪♪) >> Mark: Get your knives and forks ready. This is the battle for your belly. >> It's garbage, right. You don't want to put garbage in your body. >> Mark: It will challenge what you believe about food. >> People want simple solutions to highly complex problems. >> Mark: And who you can trust. >> Dark corners. Dark shadows. Lies. >> Mark: Are we being fed the truth about what we eat? Is there anything inherently wrong with eating wheat? >> The short answer is no. >> Mark: And should we be more careful about what we put into our bodies and our minds? >> This is one of these arguments that has one smidgen of scientific fact to it, which is then exploded into a whole blob of nonsense. >> Mark: I'm Mark Kelley and this is ""The Fifth Estate."" Tonight, the war on wheat. (wind blowing) (♪♪) >> Mark: Take a long look. What do you see growing in this field? A symbol of Canadian prosperity? The foundation of the world's diet for the past 10,000 years? Or do you see something darker? A toxin in a sheep's clothing. The foundation of many of the diseases that plague us. From diabetes, to multiple sclerosis, to breast cancer. What you see reveals which side of the war you're on. (♪♪) >> Mark: It's a cold January night in Halifax. >> The scene... Seasons restaurant at the Atlantica Hotel. A private dinner is being prepared for a very select group. It's the perfect setting to talk about food. Especially the grain that's on everyone's lips, but nobody's plate. Over candlelight and red wine the well-heeled discuss the future without wheat. >> Welcome to our restaurant. We're going to showcase food tonight that doesn't need any wheat whatsoever. >> Cheers. (background chatter) >> Mark: Here sits Dr. William Davis, the world's most influential anti-wheat Evangelist. He's changing not only what we eat, but how we see food. >> You know what bugs me? People are not given the full benefit of all the information that there really is available, that empowers you in your own health and your family's health. >> This is a salad. We have a lemon dressing. We have an avocado foam. >> Avocado foam? >> Mark: No that's avocado foam. For the uninitiated, like me, the evening is like a boot camp to galvanize the anti-wheat warriors. No beer. Yes to wine. No pizza. No bagels. No bread. The dinner party conversation reveals how the trenches are being dug. Are you wheat free? >> Yeah. >> Mark: What difference has it made for you? >> Weight loss and energy. >> You wake up in the morning and you don't feel tired. I haven drank beer in four and a half years. >> Mark: That's a serious commitment. >> Yeah, it was. >> Mark: And it was because of the book? >> Yeah. >> Mark: Wow, you're a believer! (♪♪) >> Mark: The book they're reading is Wheat Belly, written by Dr. William Davis. It's the bible of the wheat-free movement. Nearly 3 million copies of his book sold in 33 countries. More than 100 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. Not a diet book, but a manifesto. The gospel according to Dr. Davis: Wheat is killing us. We must fight back. Word spreads quickly he's in town. >> He's the author of the number 1, New York Times best-selling book, Wheat Belly Total Health. Please welcome, Dr. William Davis. (applause) >> Mark: Like in city after city all across North America, hundreds of people show up for Dr. Wheat Belly's sermon about the sins of wheat and those who eat it. >> Could I get a little poll? Who's read Wheat Belly, or at least seen some of our TV spots, etc, have some understanding? >> Mark: At first, Dr. Davis comes across like a friendly old uncle, sharing some homespun wisdom about wheat. >> I didn't set out on this path to make myself the enemy of wheat. I didn't say, I hate these darn grains. I'm gonna pick on them. And kick 'em. I really set out to help people empower themselves in health. >> Mark: But then things suddenly get serious. Wheat, he says, causes 70 to 80% of all known diseases. >> Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes in children, type 2 diabetes, seborrhea, psoriasis, dandruff, acne, joint pain, arthritis, arthralgias, hair loss. >> Mark: The list goes on and on and so does he, for full effect. >> Autoimmune alopecia, depression, eating disorders, on and on and on. If all of these, at least some, if not most of them are caused by grains, what happens if we eat no grains? I'm going to propose to you that many, if not most of these diseases disappear. They go away. >> Mark: Wheat, he argues, is not what it used to be. It's a genetically modified monster he calls Frankenwheat. And who's to blame? Well, big food companies and big government for unleashing the beast on unsuspecting consumers. >> Dark corners. Dark shadows. Lies. I think that's what we have in the world of wheat and grains. >> Mark: His message is alarming: don't trust government food guidelines or food scientists. Instead, trust him. >> This is our chance to pull back that curtain, expose the whole thing to the light of day. All right, thank you very much for listening. (applause) >> Thank you very much. >> Mark: This is the drumbeat of the war on wheat. >> Dr. William Davis is a cardiologist and the author of the best-selling book ""Wheat Belly."" >> Please welcome, Dr. William Davis. >> Welcome to the show. >> Welcome Dr. Davis. >> Mark: He uses the platform of the TV talk show circuit, touting his shocking message. >> Wheat is making us sicker than ever. I don't think anybody should be eating this. >> Mark: And claiming he has science is on his side. >> They've created this thing that is extremely destructive for health. (♪♪) >> Mark: But when you hear his back story, Dr. Davis is an unlikely warrior. He was a cardiologist in Milwaukee, trying to lose a few pounds to help fight his type 2 Diabetes. >> Mark: Tell me what your life was like before the Wheat Belly phenomenon exploded? >> Mark, I wish I could tell you that I came at this in a huge flash of insight and understood the entire terrain of all thi -- I did not. I stumbled and bumbled my way here. >> Mark: He admits he never conducted any of his own scientific studies. He just cut wheat from his diet. He says his blood sugars tumbled. His extra weight melted away. He urged his patients to follow him. And the anecdotes began to pile up. >> Patient after patient came back and said, well I did that, yes, my blood sugar's much better but I also lost 43 pounds and I didn't do anything else. >> Mark: Would you consider that you're waging a war on wheat now? >> I'm waging a war against misinformation in health in which one of the major and most destructive messages is to create a diet rich in healthy whole grains. You know Mark, I think this movement is so large. It's such a huge, earth-shattering, world-changing, life-changing perspective. I don't think any one person can take all the credit. >> Mark: But you would consider that there is a movement afoot right now? >> No question. >> Mark: The movement he spawned has shaken an industry to it's very core. 56% of Canadians now report they're cutting down on whole grains like wheat. (crackling) >> Mark: That means cutting out one third of all food: like bread, breakfast cereals, pastas, pastries, pretzels and beer. That's a big slice of the pie. Kelloggs and General Mills report a huge drop in cereal sales. Weston bakeries shut down factories and Maple Leaf foods sold its bread division. >> Have you tried gluten-free Chex Oatmeal and new Chex Granola mix? It's gluten free. Chex. Full of... >> Mark: And now, gluten and wheat free products are filling store shelves with more than $6 billion in sales last year. All of that a win for the anti-wheat movement. >> I had told myself there was no way this could be true. How could a world of nutritionists, dieticians and my colleagues get it so utterly wrong for so long? Uh, well, once you start to peel back this onion, you start to realize it is quite rotten. It's quite rotten to the core. (♪♪) >> Mark: Could he be right that everyone else has got it wrong? Well his book cites some 295 studies as proof that wheat is indeed killing us. Coming up, we take a look at whether the claims in his book are solid science, or paper thin. >> When you find something in a book that is absolutely wrong, then it makes you question everything else that is in there. (♪♪) (♪♪) >> Mark: Saskatchewan, the breadbasket of Canada, the land of the wheat kings. (♪♪) >> Mark: They've been growing the grain here commercially since the 1880s. >> Here there was rich hard kernels of health. The wheat falls beneath the knives. >> Mark: Over generations, wheat has migrated from prairie farms to processed foods. >> There no other cereal like Nabisco Wheat Honeys. >> Mark: To kitchen cupboards. >> Wheat Thins taste really good and they're full of natural whole wheat. >> Mark: Generations of TV viewers were fed the same message over and over again. >> Cream of Wheat gives you five times more iron than any leading hot oat cereal. >> Have some Wheat Chex, Tim, they're good for you. (♪♪) >> Mark: And when the summer sun shines in Saskatchewan, the wheat fields glow. To farmers here, that's the glow of money. Saskatchewan now provides 10% of the exported wheat in the world. A war on wheat is an all out assault on a 2 billion dollar cash crop. Now it's true millions of people do get sick eating wheat. People with celiac disease. But that's about 1% of the population. Others have allergies and sensitivities to wheat. But Dr. William Davis insists Wheat is bad for all of us because, it's not your grandparents wheat. He says it's something much worse. Modern wheat's dirty little secret? Wheat proteins - gluten and gliadins - that he claims, have been modified by scientists and now act like a chemical on our brains. A chemical we get hooked to, like junkies. Modern wheat, he says, is an opiate, like heroin. Creating food addictions. >> Modern wheat is a perfect chronic poison. It's literally an opiate or an opioid. Gliadin partially breaks down and becomes opiates that bind to the human brain. >> When you find something in a book that is absolutely wrong, then it makes you question everything else that is in there. >> Mark: We asked Joe Schwarcz to examine the science behind Wheat Belly. He's a chemist at McGill dedicated to demystifying science and debunking big claims. >> Is there any evidence that wheat is addictive? >> No, certainly none that I've seen, and if it is addictive it is not because it contains any of these peptides. Those peptides are also found in spinach, they're found in dairy and a whole range of other foods. >> Mark: He says opioid peptides are produced when some foods are digested. But just because they can bind to opiate receptors in the brain doesn't mean they produce a morphine-like effect. >> If we're going to say that -- that is addictive, it would be along the line that people like foods that have wheat in them. >> Mark: But that's not a physical addiction? >> It's not a physical addiction. And I know of no evidence of physical addiction. (♪♪) >> Mark: Turns out Dr. Davis bases this claim mainly on one study of rat brains, done on dead rats in 1979. To date, there has been no study on humans that conclusively proves wheat is addictive. It gets a lot more dangerous than that. Dr. Davis says wheat also causes cancer. >> The wheat of today is by far, hands down, the worst possible thing you could eat. High blood pressure, heart sisease, dementia, cancer. >> Mark: Colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer. He says women with wheat bellies have a 400% greater likelihood of getting breast cancer. So let's follow his logic here. Research has indeed linked obesity to cancer. But lots of things can make you fat. Davis concludes that because wheat is one of them, it causes cancer. But the direct connection has yet to be made. >> Mark: he makes the link that wheat causes breast cancer. Have you seen any evidence of that? >> I've never seen any evidence of that. I mean, there's four new scientific papers that come out every single minute of every day, 365 days a year. You know? How is it that they missed the connection between gluten and breast cancer, you know, having worked for decades in this area? >> Mark: But it's not just physical illness. Dr. Davis also links wheat to mental illness - from depression to dementia to schizophrenia. He devotes an entire chapter to this astounding claim. >> PMS, depression, bipolar illness, paranoia,anxiety, acid reflux, irritable bowel syndrome, depression, on and on and on. Why do we observe the phenomenon of paranoia and hearing voices -- auditory hallucinations -- recede dramatically when we take the wheat out of the diet of our schizophrenic patients? >> Mark: The study Dr. Davis was just talking about was conducted in 1966. And once again, after almost 50 years of research, no one can point to any definitive study that specifically links wheat to schizophrenia. >> It's relatively easy when you know some science to cherry pick the data and to make it sound much more compelling than It is, and -- especially if you can kind of portray yourself as kind of the knight in shining armour who's going to save the population from the clutches of this unholy alliance between big pharma, big food, the agriculture industry, academic scientists, who, for some reason, want to undermine our health. This is one of these arguments that has one smidgen of scientific fact to it, which is then exploded into a whole blob of nonsense. (♪♪) >> Mark: But the big question: Are we being terrorized by genetically modified Frankenwheat? It's the foundation of the Wheat Belly argument. >> The wheat of today is nothing like the wheat of 40 years ago. It's not wheat. I call it Frankenwheat. Nobody, no human should be eating this modern creation of genetics research. >> Mark: Modern wheat, he argues, is a crude result of experimentation, a frightening brainchild of agricultural scientists. (♪♪) >> Mark: Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan wanted to see if that's true. Has wheat's basic protein structure been altered? (♪♪) >> Mark: This is the only lab in The world doing this kind of research and one of the few labs that smells like fresh baked bread. Here at the University of Saskatchewan they've been studying wheat for more than a hundred years. Everything from how it grows, to how it bakes, to how it tastes. This is bread grown with wheat developed in 1935. This one from wheat developed in 1991. (♪♪) >> Mark: Hmm. You'd never know the difference. (♪♪) >> Mark: Okay so, it tastes the same. But deep down is it really still the same? So show me some of the differences here, if you can, between these grains. >> So first thing, this is red fife. >> Mark: The research is being led by Dr. Ravi Chabbar. He's a wheat geneticist. He's paid to advise the grain industry. But he says this project is being funding by a federal government program which invests in: ""the world's most accomplished and promising minds."" >> Mark: And this is the... >> The oldest. >> Mark: The oldest. >> 1860, yeah. >> Mark: 1860. (♪♪) > Mark: Over time, yes, wheat has been modified to produce high yield crops. But what about its proteins - gluten and gliadins? Well, researchers studied the genetic profiles of 37 different Varieties of wheat grown in Canada since the 1800s. It may look different over time, but research shows it's not Frankenwheat. Chabbar's discovery? For all intents and purposes, it is your grandparents wheat. >> What we want to say is that between the ancient wheats and the modern wheats, they are very similar. They're very similar. They're nutritionally good because proteins, you need proteins, right? >> Mark: How can someone just stand up and say wheat is bad, wheat is toxic? >> That is that person's opinion. (♪♪) >> Mark: But it's not just any person's opinion. Dr. Davis has won the unqualified trust of millions of people. Coming up, we find out why. >> The truth is not easy to sell. The trust is not sexy. The inconvenient truth of healthful living is that it does require effort. (♪♪) (♪♪) >> Mark: Wheat feeds more people than any other single source of food in the world but that's Changing. Fast. As the war on wheat convinces more people to eat wheat free. (♪♪) >> Mark: More than half of Canadians say they are cutting back on grains like wheat from their diet. (chopping) >> Mark: The movement is winning over more and more intelligent, Influential, and nutrition conscious converts. >> Mark: And food is their life. (♪♪) >> A little flavour, a little colour. >> Mark: Meet Rachael Hunt and Rachel Bies, two women with a shared enemy, wheat. >> Mmmm. >> Mark: Now they're educating others about the health benefits of going wheat free. Bit by bit. Bite by bite. >> And then we did quinoa brown rice pasta with organic ground chicken. And a bunch of seasonal vegetables. >> Bon appetit. >> Mark: The Rachels started Gluten freedom week in Toronto. >> You know when you've been hit with gluten. It's like within 45 minutes, it's like, boom. >> Mark: A public awareness campaign to convince restaurants and food retailers to join the movement. >> And are you fully gluten free now? >> Yeah. It was so difficult but it changed my whole way of eating. >> Mark: And it's not just people who are going wheat free, so are entire businesses. Like this one. It's called ""Feast."" That's an acronym for ""fabulous eats for allergic and sensitive types."" Like Rachel and Rachael. Show me some of the gluten-free products here that I could try and taste because this is all new to me. What do you really love here? >> Coconut bacon. >> So good. >> Mark: Coconut bacon? >> It's honestly addictive and I go through about one of these a week. >> Mark: Let me see this. Here goes. Mmm. That's good. So why did the Rachels go wheat-free? Well their reasoning is ripped right from the pages of the best seller ""Wheat Belly"", written by Dr. William Davis. >> It's not all wheat, it's our wheat in North America. It's been genetically modified. It's not our parents wheat from the '50s. It's now this, you know, some people call it Frankenwheat. It's addictive. It's garbage, right? You don't want to put garbage in your body, so... >> Mark: Neither of them has been tested to see if they have Celiac or a wheat sensitivity. Neither had a doctor prescribe a wheat-free diet. They trusted their gut on this one, and for them it works. >> My energy levels, my mental capacity, my -- even my skin my digestive system. Everything started to just work as it should work. I'm more productive in a day than gluten Rachel. (laughter) >> New and improved Rachael is Gluten-free. (laughter) >> Mark: Truth is, for most people, Wheat Belly isn't about a new lifestyle, it's about losing weight. And you will, at least in the short term. By losing the wheat, you dramatically reduce your carbs and calories. So why then is this book making such an impact. Well, it's one part celebrity author, a side order of celebrity endorsements, and a heaping helping of hype. (sizzling) >> Mark: Fantastic. What do we have here? >> We have our pumpkin ravioli. And we have the gnocchi here. >> Terrific. >> Mark: Yoni Freedhoff is a family doctor in Ottawa and a diet expert, who runs a nutrition clinic. He doesn't believe in fad diets, or miracle foods. Or Dr. Davis. >> Mark: So I guess this is wrong on every level in terms of a wheat-free diet? >> I don't think Dr. Davis would join us for this meal. >> Mark: Dr. Freedhoff says Wheat Belly is similar to other carb-free diets that cut out bread, pasta and potatoes. The big difference? Dr. Davis. >> Mark: Good. >> This just took it to another level with a very charismatic doctor, who has a presentation that to me is reminiscent of an Evangelical preacher. You know with -- you can be healed and away you go, and I think that is, again, it's what people want to hear. We want to believe in magic. >> Mark: If none of this has been proven, why do so many People believe it to be true? >> You know, the truth is not easy to sell. Um, the truth is not sexy. The inconvenient truth of healthful living is that it does require effort. >> Mark: Dr. Freedhoff says he would never recommend this diet to his patients because he believes wheat is good for us. >> Unlike what Dr. Davis has been saying, there's no question that diets rich in whole grains have been shown to be protective against a myriad of diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and just mortality as a whole. There was a study published just a couple of weeks ago that reconfirmed that fact. >> Mark: And it's not just Dr. Freedhoff. Many medical associations won't endorse the wheat belly diet. If you don't have celiac disease, even the Canadian Celiac Association won't endorse a gluten-free diet. Neither does the American Heart Association, the Obesity Society or the American College of Cardiology. And Dr. Davis is a cardiologist. (applause) >> I think what's driving this Is a tidal wave of change. We have sparked a movement. >> Mark: But there is one Influential community that does support the wheat-free movement. Celebrities. Take a look. Their food choices are the staple of morning TV talk shows. >> People including Hollywood A-listers like Anne Hathaway and Gwyneth Paltrow are eliminating the protein found in wheat, rye and barley from their diet. >> Cutting out gluten does seem to be gaining in popularity. Even Chelsea Clinton opted for a gluten-free wedding cake. >> Mark: Dr. Davis' wheat free philosophy has attracted high profile disciples... >> Miley! >> Mark: Such as the pop star, Miley Cyrus. Canadian basketballer Steve Nash. And the chief glutenista of all, actress Gwyneth Paltrow, seen here on the Dr. Oz show. She has 2 million followers on Twitter where she promotes her Gluten-free lifestyle. >> I felt great. I had lost weight and I though there really is something to this. So what I do here is... >> Mark: She has let the world know she won't consider feeding her young children bread, pasta or rice. >> Mark: Bon appetit. >> Mark: Lots of people look up to Gwyneth. Tim Caulfield, a health policy professor, isn't one of them. >> This is great. >> Mark: This is great. He questions the impact of celebrity on science in his new book: 'Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong about Everything?' He even did her 30-day cleanse to see if it would make him a believer. It didn't. From your experience who do people trust more? Is it the food evangelists like Dr. Davis or a celebrity like Gwyneth Paltrow, or is it a food scientist who's out there? >> This is an excellent point. I think that there is a trust issue that's going on. But in addition to that it helps reinforce that eating gluten as a form of self-expression or part of a community that eats gluten-free. You know, I drive my Prius, you know, I recycle, I'm gluten free and I think that's part of why this has become so popular. >> Mark: Caulfield says people may not trust food scientists, but they do trust their friends and neighbours who swear Wheat Belly works for them. Don't these anecdotal examples; don't they become sort of a body of scientific evidence? >> First of all, a bunch of anecdotes added together does not make good data, right? They're just -- it's just anecdote plus anecdote and having a whole bunch of it doesn't make it stronger. >> Mark: You know what makes the claims stronger? >> Just because you're going wheat free doesn't mean you need to go taste free. >> Mark: Powerful platforms like the Dr. Oz show. Two doctors united in the war on wheat. >> In fact, there are so many adverse components of wheat, I wonder why we even try to eat this stuff. >> Mark: Sure, Dr. Oz got into trouble recently, scolded by a US senate committee for making fantastical claims about another diet. >> I don't get why you need to say this stuff when you know it's not true. >> My job, I feel, on the show, is to be a cheerleader for the audience. So my show is about hope. The Wheat Belly diet's never been easier or faster -- >> Mark: And hope was what he was selling with Dr. Davis. >> Complete relief within 5 days. >> Within five days. >> Mark: Unchallenged claims broadcast to Dr. Oz audience in 118 countries. (♪♪) >> Mark: Here at Stanford University in California, one of the world's leading scientists says enough is enough. >> How can we guarantee quality when we have not just a few scientists but a huge -- >> Mark: Dr. John Iaonnidis made his name researching scientific research. And take it from him, he says Dr. Davis cannot claim to have science on his side. >> This is one example where a big claim is made practically on thin air. I mean, we're not even talking about science here. It's not scientific studies that lead to that claim. It's mostly a belief system. >> Mark: But he agrees scientists are being drowned out by celebrities and pseudoscience in the war on wheat. >> I think that scientists have lost the rock star battle. (laughing) >> The public have not been used to listening to science. They have been used to listening to movie stars, and no numbers, just big claims, big quotes. >> Mark: Without science, what are we left with? >> I don't think we're left with anything. I don't think we can really have a meaningful, rational life and expect to make any progress. >> Mark: Coming up, we go against the grain with Dr. Davis. Have you ever sat down and wondered, looked up and thought, what if I'm wrong? (♪♪) (♪♪) >> Mark: The debate about Whether wheat is good for us, or killing us, plays into a much bigger food fight. Although we've been consuming food since the dawn of humanity, we still can't seem to agree about what is good for us. >> A new study raises the possibility -- think about this -- that high milk consumption may be linked with more bone fractures and a higher death rate. What? >> Mark: Just turn on the TV: Food science can be confusing. >> For decades we've looked at cholesterol as the number one public health enemy. But now, new research, they're always bringing out new research. >> More research, including one study out today finds saturated fat isn't so bad after all. >> Mark: It's easy to see why people don't know what or who to believe about food. So, are more people questioning science? Absolutely! A recent survey polled 3000 scientists and 2000 everyday people about current controversies from vaccines to climate change. But the biggest difference in opinion between the two groups, it was around food. Despite widespread support from scientists, only 37% of the population believes food that's been genetically modified is safe to eat. And into that chasm of doubt walks Wheat Belly author Dr. William Davis. He says he is leading a war on misinformation, while claiming wheat has caused 'more human disease and suffering than all wars combined.' He blames experts who support eating wheat for creating a 'collective madness' larger than the Salem witch trials or the 'fear-mongering of the red Scare'. Their nutritional advice makes 'bleeding with leeches' or 'frontal lobotomies' seem quaint. >> When I've actually engaged... >> Mark: Despite selling millions of books, and winning over millions of converts, the anti-wheat evangelist insists the battle is just beginning. Do you think you are now in the process of winning the war? >> You know, it's more like the war on terror. It's not something that has a discrete start and end. It's going to be an ongoing process. I think I'm part of the conversation driving that. You know, I feel bad for those people. They're just trying to do their job. I don't think they're bad people, just as the tobacco executives of the 1960's and 70's, you know, who under Congressional testimony said, you know, well, I did it because I needed to pay my mortgage and my son's tuition. They're just nice people trying to do their job. I don't think... >> Mark: But do you equate somebody growing wheat or selling wheat products with people who sell cigarettes? >> I would if it becomes increasingly clear that this is stuff that humans never should have eaten in the first place. >> Mark: One of your biggest claims is that wheat has killed more people than all wars combined. Do you stand by that? >> Yes. You know, we can't be real precise in the numbers, but think of it, how much diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disease, ulcerative colitis, crohn's -- I could go on. We're talking about hundreds of millions of people, or more, over the years. >> Mark: Okay, so let's talk about a real person: me. So I'm a wheat consumer. I don't over-consume. I have a healthy diet. I have none of these health issues. Why not? Why am I healthy if I eat wheat? >> There's going to be great individual variation. There are people -- there's an occasional person, Mark, who escapes all the effects for a lifetime, but they're very uncommon. Much more common is this, someone thinks they're escaping the process, the problems but are either unaware of the problems or they're developing slowly beneath the surface of perception so it's a very tough cause/effect to connect. >> Mark: But hold on. His whole war is about cause and effect. Is he feeding us a message that hurts us or helps us? Your critics will say, at best, you're peddling hope, at worst, you're spreading misinformation, and profiting from it. How do you respond to that? >> Oh, the same way I'd respond to their arguments. They're -- they misinterpreted the data to begin with. I believe they're the ones who've not looked at all the evidence. >> Mark: Have you ever wondered, look up and thought, what if I'm wrong? >> I did up until about three years ago, because I have the wonderful benefit of seeing it play out. If I did this in ten people and it worked in all ten, that'd be Interesting. One hundred times, that's getting real interesting. A thousand times, wow, maybe we're on to something. Ten thousand, a hundred-thousand times, over and over and over and over, you see success play out. Experience would suggest that we've stumbled on to something that is incredibly effective, yet flies in the face of all traditional notions of nutrition. >> Mark: Wheat Belly is packed With anecdotes, stories of miraculous weight loss and transformational health changes. So we asked Dr. Davis if any scientists or medical associations have endorsed his 'grain-free lifestyle'? He said no. Researchers will tell you that on the pyramid of evidence, anecdotes, they're not only on the bottom, they're in the basement. It's like hearsay. Does an accumulation of anecdotes actually really equate to science? >> No, absolutely not. So I try to make that as clean as I can. That is, anecdotes are provided for human interest because it makes fun reading. People want to hear about people like themselves, but if I wrote a book only about the science, Which by the way, I'd love to do, but sad to say, most of the public would not read it. (♪♪) >> Mark: So, is Wheat Belly just an entertaining story carefully crafted to sell books? And if so, what about the millions of people who believe in the gospel according to Dr. Davis. So are we digging in? >> Yeah. We've got three different types of patties here. >> Mark: people like Rachael and Rachel. People who are so inspired by what they read they make dramatic changes to what they eat. >> Mark: That's good. There's a lot of science out there that challenges the science that William Davis is referring to. >> Right. >> Mark: Are you skeptical about those studies? >> Absolutely. Who's funding the studies that are saying that wheat that's processed, heavily processed wheat is good for you, right? I'm skeptical of people that are putting things out there that are making a dime off of it. I'm skeptical of anyone that's... >> Mark: But isn't William Davis doing that? >> Absolutely, but people aren't -- if people are going to start following or taking out gluten, I don't think people are going to be worse off for it. >> Mark: I think the big issues at the end of the day for a lot of us, all of us, no matter where you stand on this, is trust. >> Yeah. >> Mark: Who do you trust at the end of the day? >> Your body. >> Yeah. I think at the end of the day, it's just trusting your instinct and what makes you feel better. (♪♪) >> Mark: despite the fact the vast majority of scientists and health organizations don't support much of what Dr. Davis says, more and more people are giving up wheat. They say they're doing it because it makes them feel better. And maybe that will be the deciding factor in the war on wheat. (♪♪) >> Mark: you may not agree with everyone or everything you heard on the show tonight. So we encourage you to go to our website and add your vo"
0,save all the good things for camera and when the cameras are rolling just to kind of introduce why we're all kind of here on a Saturday afternoon I host the show here called minority reports it's a digital show and we're doing an episode based around like the political ideologies of the black community and how they differ and where they overlap and so we've brought you know a nice eclectic group of brown people here to kind of discuss politics and how we all come to our political ideologies as members of the black community in America hopefully what this will do is allow our audience who probably wouldn't find themselves in this type of an environment to have this type of a conversation to learn something so with all that being said three words or less when you think of Donald Trump what is the first thing that comes to mind and Rob why don't we start with you strong make America great can we come back to me oh his ancestors wildest dreams very scary trash man anti-black necessary hmm I just think unicorn in the sense of just causing so much discussion the reason why Donald Trump is in the spotlight right now is because of our past failed governments for the simple fact that when the Republican primary happened there was like 16 different candidates and don't get me wrong there was like really good ones really stature to the point that everyone in this group would be like oh yeah I can see why he won but in Donald Trump became our opportunist and knocked down every single person week by week like it was Larry watching a different season of The Apprentice look what has America done that a guy from the outside can just walk in there bing bang boom it's and take down these iconic structured politicians that we look up to throughout our whole lives draining the swamp as it was yeah but can we talk about that though like this whole notion of like a guy from the outside like that's part of my issue right like if you really know how this country is being run like the country has always been run by rich billionaires so like he's not from the outside this country has always been run by Pharma this country has always been run by banks this country is literally run by the industries that he made his millions and billions in so like this whole thing like oh he's a political outside no because politics has always been run by capitalism which is the system that has always suppressed minorities so like that's it's capitalism has always I don't think so I do have to jump in and take a little bit of umbrage with this idea that capitalism is some sort of system that oppresses minorities up to this point and also I don't like saying minorities we want to talk about black people like let's just talk about black people because I'm not a minority I just wanna make that point all right absolutely so so when we look at capitalism as as something that has oppressed minorities or is oppressing minorities we removed from ourselves the capacity to use capitalism in order to little bill in our communities in order to move forward for ourselves yeah by show fans who here voted for Donald Trump all day from I didn't know vote in the 2016 election tell me why I didn't blow in the 2016 election because war wasn't my life I didn't feel like either those candidates had earned my vote I considered myself a Democrat at the time I loved Hillary Clinton in the entire - if you really want to get into it I voted for Bernie Sanders on the property in the New York State Hey for the black conservatives how do you align with white conservatives when they speak mallove black people just in terms of how especially states speak of black men you know how you stand with them when they are continuously how do you do that it's over and continuous from the Democratic Party as well so so people even late anyway you go you races there gonna be some races all over the place so now it's like okay yo watch your mouth like I'm not okay we're not going that route what is your reaction when you see a black person wearing a mag ahead I think it a last part when you see a black person wearing a mag ahead three words or less what is your reaction go for it three words or less there's the story I don't know that's poor I don't know there's a story independent-minded brother oh I got one word it's bold that's so funny he said brother boos oh cringe cringe you do you looks good on you can't fit on my head what is your perception of black conservatives believing in Trump's rhetoric just morally I don't understand because morally just him as a person as a as an entity just seen it's just super corrupt and his ideologies I don't understand how anyone can go can be about it but especially especially a black person just as identity as a black person I don't understand it the thing about it is is that he asked me about conservatism and then you took a de trop like later for those of us who identify as conservative right I want to hear about your treatment within the black community being an outspoken black conservative and then I want to hear about the perceptions that you think people have of you whoever wants to start well I'll start with myself because like so look you're gonna hear and I'm gonna let bevel and speak to the black perspective but I'm just being from the gay perspective so all right because I came out as a black gay conservative about six months ago I have been treated horribly by other gay people the only friends that have dumped me are quote-unquote friends that have dumped me for for being conservative Republican have been the gay ones the people who give me the most believe on social media have been the gay ones the people that call me the nest is all kinds of like Oh house Uncle Tom like all this stuff like these have been gay people are the people from the quote-unquote tolerant and inclusive LGBTQ community all right so this is what my experience has been and in being somebody that has been an advocate and still consider myself an advocate just not in the way that they want me to be I was very shocked by that because I think that when I came out as conservative they like to push forward this this this veneer of inclusion and tolerance and that dropped like that so it was the nastiest treatment that I had ever seen and I never expected it and you never expected as a gay person until it happens to you for me like it's thought about my high school friends everybody was unfriended me on Facebook because you know I was talking about the Trump election and I went to the inauguration and all of that so my fam and then they trickle down to my family I just won't speak to me even now I got honest that don't talk to me because I'm I wanna be right so it's like I get this stigma all the time all right now oh you you want to be writing you don't move to New York City and now thank you you are up there with the big city you want to be right that's it seems like when I speak of what I speak of is only the fact that I just want to be right and that's so far fetched from the truth I've been called the bed wench I've been called and I mean I'm talking my from my black brothers who own a they are they paid who took my black Queens and all this stuff like that but the moment I don't agree with nothing ain't talking about now I'm a bad witch now I'm and now you're not saying I'm all this other stuff and it's just like I mean to be honest with you ain't nobody been busting up to say none of this stuff in my face and ain't not going up well this is via social media we know this but at the same time is just like hatred is the nothing but hatred and you know for me it's like even when I deal with liberals who may have their little mind settle with anything I gonna disrespect them and call them all types of names it's like I've gained all that fly-in disrespect and it's just like because I want to be white this is what I did so does anyone well I I said made a statement on online I got pretty a lot of people commenting on it was I didn't see true racism in this country to our came a conservative guys I've seen hate what hate speech come from people you know about left hard time I hate so much I saw true hate coming from the left and it was white people calling me up with Tom pre-med white good tell I'm not black enough which is you called them out on it and say they're racist that's like think about like well yeah I'm kind of being racist that's how racist the Left still is yeah and then I had like she said my hunts don't talk to me anymore I have high school friends could use a childhood they don't want you know don't talk to me on a of me and a lot of white friends as well now I'm gonna talk about his black friends I'm talking about people on the left in general you just have that hate in our heart in my opinion and it's just uh you know that's I mean it's so interesting that on the left like the whoa keys is what I call them these are the people the woman's give me the white liberals of the left missile base to tell a black person how to be black and how you were supposed to experience pink as a black who here voted for Barack Obama family everybody well twice campaign for him in a week well so did I she had a great campaign not instead of vote for a semi personal question did anyone vote for him just because he was black not just but that was a big reason I put yeah see how them it's really funny because I'm a conservative and I will admit that I voted for Barack Obama in 2008 purely because he was black I did you know I'll admit it and in the reason why I voted for him is because I was so open to in and so available to be used by all of the systems that made that person president right and for all of the systems that that were promoted to me this idea that just because he is biracial african-american whatever you wanna call it that he is going to somehow have my best interest at heart that he comes from the same experience that I did know I come from the same source me let me tell you something I've got the lacking for an Akron Ohio okay this person was born and raised and wealth and privilege his entire life and the idea hmm that this person was somehow more connected to me because we certain share the same skin color is crazy but I bought it and it was sold to me I bought and I mean it's a mistake in a way that I voted for mainly because he was a black man I think yeah it was a mistake that's lame yeah and uh and eight years later Lee a mistake that's the one reason why I'm conservative now because I said when I was young more naive I will go in to vote for somebody cause of the way to look and look what it did for me absolutely nothing so I make sure next I make a vote it's gonna be with some substance it's gonna make sure where somebody's gonna have what they're saying and what their actions is what I make because their vote and as we move forward by show of hands who is disappointed with the Barack Obama presidency what's the point with I mean we put a black face on a white imperialist nation and expected that change was gonna happen my grandmother my ancestors especially my grandmother my grandfather they were sold that that was what the American Dream was supposed to look like that a black man could come in this country could that black people could come from chattel slavery and achieved the highest position in the land unfortunately the way that these systems of oppression work especially K through 12 we're often taught that leadership what's gonna lead black people to liberation is gonna come from a white man oh and you know so like when we then had a black face up there it really felt like oh oh we really close like we really really close but then it was a lot of unlearning that a lot of us had to do a lot of unlearning that we all still currently have to do to understand that our oppression you know where our pressuring came from and the fact that like we're never going to be led to liberation in a binary system a binary system for black people is literally always going to be choosing a lesser or two evils no matter how you slice it or dice it whether it's a Republican in office whether it's a Democrat in office I'm always choosing my death either as a blunt-force blow or death by a thousand paper cuts and it tends why I guess in general black people always lean Democratic is because that death is by a thousand paper cuts as opposed to what I'm dealing with right now where I'm watching HIV funding being stripped as a black queer hiv-positive person where I'm watching trans people losing all of their rights in this country as an LGBTQ person what are trans people losing take it so we can start with in 2017 the Office of National AIDS policy was taken away there is no more not Office of National AIDS policy transgender women including especially black trans people are the highest infected people of HIV in this country including black MSM so you had that office taken away you then have had where 586 million dollars was removed from the Ryan White fund and transferred for the border separations Ryan White money is what pays for people to have HIV care in this country when they cannot afford it that includes transgender people you have where seven words were removed from the CDC funding including vulnerable transgender and scientific base so now companies that supported trans rights and trans people can't write grants to get money to help that particular demographic you have the transgender military ban when I say that they are literally attacking LGBTQ rights this is not a joke it is just coming because it's so much going on you just missed that every day these little things are happening I just wanted to say if it's curious to me because I'm somebody who's gay as well I'm gay I'm not queer I'm not LGBTQ I am a game you can't speak to one spot oh no I can't and what's so curious to me is that we talk about our community as if everybody this transgender is infected with HIV or has housing insecurity as everybody that's a game lesbian like black or males Nettie for ten minutes now but I said this is how so my whole thing is so this is how we speak of the community all the times is that we are always some oppressed victim gay person it drives me insane because I fought for LGBT rights when I got arrested at the front of the White House protesting Don't Ask Don't Tell repeal because I served in the military for five years I grew up porn black in Akron Ohio all right I went to one of the worst schools in Akron Ohio I went to the military risked my life multiple times okay to get every single thing that I have right now there is no reason that every single black kid on the block can do that same thing so you didn't vote for Donald Trump I did not what are the issues that you take with the president so just really quickly to a point that George said right that I feel like the candidates that kept being put up year after year after year keep hard lighting us we're saying we're choosing the lesser of two evils right well I think that it's really important that we see candidates that come from our communities that are talking about like for me right I'm 25 years old my student loan debt was due on Monday it doesn't pay that right because I don't have the money to pay that right away so thinking about what are ways that we see people who are experiencing the same thing who are coming from our community we also recognize the historical debt that this country has to black people and to people of color so that we can move forward so we know that like none of us are free unless all of us are free thank you none adored me how free so you voted for Donald Trump yeah you mind telling us why he won your vote in 2016 at first I really didn't know much about what Trump was doing I just knew okay it ain't hurt so I'm just gonna vote for him and I was still coming into being a conservative and all of that and I just got converted to a Christian I'm looking at my Christian values and I'm growing as a Christian I'm realizing wow you're not I mean this man is really aligning himself with what you truly believe in you know I'm coming from the south I don't know Carolina we're really Christians you're not saying well we're my people from you know everything is based off of that so I'm not gonna support any party that's gonna support abortion you know I've said we just now getting kind of comfortable with homosexuality you know what I'm saying and also you know it's just like with marriage you know divorce in and everybody's stupid every time to get here you know in the south it ain't like that so it's like that's just that foundation of trouble but now going into the economy I mean I'm a businesswoman I have my own financial consulting company and seeing what he's been doing to where my taxes are not too high and I'm not paying for what I came from aka living off the food stamps and katika and I got family on food stamps that continue to live offer and I know listen I can't be the hood I can't I was just in the hood yesterday cuz my cousin just got out of jail someone to go see him so I mean this is what I'm around everyday and it's like my cousin's got the same opportunities I got all they know about is either they go making it basketball or big gonna have to just try to get some type of job and make it I'm like no let's start a business of like let's get this chicken let's get it's a real estate firm is helping certain people you guys helping me but if yeah but it's very you know you know you what I'm saying is this for me because I was able to step out and this is a chick who got a felony who had five years probation who got a felony for grand larceny which came down for money laundering so when I say I was going white-collar crime I was out here in these streets hustling scamming please okay and so what I did was I made a choice to surrender my life to Jesus and live righteously and so what he did was he put me in a position to where now I can teach people about finances and how to get out of the illegal game and clean their money the right way get their credit on point get into real estate flip houses and live a good stewarded life with money so now I'm taking my cousin's who also drugs all of my cousin's sell drugs is they not playing board selling drugs and if they in jail they're getting out to sell drugs cuz both did to old football so all they know how to do is get money so how do you tell somebody who's been getting money or they like oh so now I must work a regular job like we get paid me gonna take tax on my check and they don't even know where the taxes is going so they just work 40 hours a week they think anybody's get a nice little 500 shekels say 250 they might wait why I'm about to go sell drugs again so now I have to teach them how to get out here in the legal game and let's flip this money the right way and again the taxes that are placed on these businesses can either help us or hurt us and what Trump is doing is helping me teach my cousin's in the hood how to move so that they can give money and not keep busting people upside the head for money or selling drugs to people these people that a continuously living on welfare we're paying for it so the more you're giving them in sports tamps the more you're allowing them to extended their lifestyle in the projects the more money is coming out of my pocket like well as a taxpayer and then now it's hindering my business well now I'm not paying that much taxes I got more money so now if I need to say to whom yo listen I got five racks I'm about to invest this into you so we can start working on your business and if we're gonna let the money circulating once a circle leg you could go out on your own if taxes are taking that money how can I take that five racks and give it to me that's part of my problem with Donald Trump is he's literally making the rich richer and what happens with that poor have to get for it raise your hand if you agree with the statement that I'm about to make the welfare system destroyed the black family absolutely yes yes yes absolutely people who did not raise their hands please tell me why you disagree with that assertion you do not agree with that assertion you know you could it's just and I think the other issue is like nobody's actually talking about like how that system like those systems affirmative-action benefited more white women than it did in about to make a correlation but you know I was going to say is that a lot of these systems that literally have been stereotyped to look like it's black people who benefit the most from them is actually white people who benefit the most from them I was going to when I brought up affirmative action I was bringing it up as a correlation like affirmative action is always sold publicly like it's benefited more black diamond actually is benefited more white women welfare is a system that there are more white people in this country on welfare than black people have benefited from welfare play nice in the sandbox please finish your point yeah so again my point goes back to like when like just like we were saying like with the whole like whether it hurt the black community or whether it helped the black community that's not really the issue the issue is that all these are systems of oppression oppression and all the systems are interconnected and we can't keep looking at these systems that's like oh well this is this one thing and this affects this like even when she was bringing up her paycheck she's like what my paycheck is going to this like yeah but your paycheck is also going to infrastructure your paycheck is also going to Medicaid your paycheck is also going to Medicare your paycheck is also going to Social Security which is what else my grandmother survived your paycheck like you okay but she's told they're gonna play for you can we make up our own money to never get so again what I'm saying is like my point that I'm trying to make is that the systems are interconnected so like you just keep speaking like this system is this and we need to remove this money from this system it's like that's not how that works these systems are all interconnected so it's not like you're just removing something from here and it's not gonna have a chain reaction on the other ways that they're able to oppress us through a different system and I understand all this and and we can have these very academic conversations about systems of oppression and innocent even to be and other things like we can what we really mean is assumption is how do we help the people right what what are the what are the policies that you have seen put forth either by conservative politicians or by our current president that you agree with that you feel are benefiting the black community just forever example we look at trouble you do what it was done with tariffs for the trades yeah we've done that now he's bringing jobs back into the country when you give jobs back into the country you look like unemployment that Louis has been in American history black and up let me say right now so it has benefits not just me but any person that's black yeah how's it not benefit that's Trump has everything a lot think Trump's is done when it comes to jobs economy comes to the stock market I'm investing for a person on my entire life and making a lot of money by the way thank you Darren from for that so I mean and I'm a black man in my black but is there a visible wall that's this wall that says all your black you can invest no I go right through that wall and not invest that's what black can do we stop playing victim and start being a big tour yes for those of us who have a problem with some of the policies that have been offered by conservative politicians or by the city administration I want to ask you a very specific question do you believe that either the sitting president in his administration offer racist policies or that the party that conservative politicians fall under offer racist policies I want to stop calling thing as racist again like that's why I don't talk anymore in like in terms of racism by Toni Morrison said racism zuv distraction she had a very good point also access from doing the actual work we need to do I work in my community I do HIV testing that I got physically work with the people who I talk about like you know to me I don't tell people go pull yourself up by the bootstraps I go by the goddamn boots for them because I have a little bit more privileged than them but when we talk about it I'm talking about anti blackness because this is a global thing and I think that's the part that they were bringing up earlier like we can't just look at like some isolationism just of black Americans or just of this like anti black this is a global thing and it's all interconnected and the problem is like people are like oh we shouldn't talk about the intersections we've never had the ability to talk about the intersections so this is the time that we actually need to start talking about the damn intersections because we've never had that opportunity if they're one we'll say about Donald Trump is that yeah he opened up the floor for conversations so now because now for the first time ever in this country white people feel as necessary now that white people feel oppressed they calling me all the damn time because now they want to know what oppression feel like now they want to know well why'd you get to this because now I'm getting booked and busy all the damn time called white people Philip ran a not used to that a particular part of this country for the first time ever in their whole lives feel just as oppressed as my ass is and we also talked like about like the tax bill cuz you know tell me tell me about that um so my biggest issue was with that tax bill I think recently one of the bigger companies got ten million dollars in like tax benefits and they're gonna donate it but that money belongs to you that money should be for you and all of us and all our family it doesn't belong to the one percent ten percent of America when we talk about white people and the one-percenters in the original us know when we always assume that black people are broke that there are no point people in the one percent of this country that there are no black people that are CEO that there are no point people that are business owners that there are no black people that head and run the corporations that benefit from these people the prism of brokenness and oppression as if the black one-percenters don't exist well we could talk about the exception in the rule right because what you're speaking of is the exception of blacks I need to start actually having real conversations about reparations right and like what reparations actually look like Jewish people receiving reparations right now in this time but you're like no there's not enough time in the day organization people have websites where they've actually created models and thinking about like oh even if you forget the meal right what is actually 40 acres for four black people look like or just recognizing that the trauma and the history that has been affected on black people like I think about like literacy right you can't tell black people for 200 plus years that you can't read and then give them books and be like why aren't you reading why aren't you reading without her address in that trauma right there's things in our talk about those has ever given me is the opportunity to see myself as an individual collective yes all the time and just for me it's just like we're working we're behind people like we're always supposed to be a part of some monolith and collective where we're just supposed to always we have to always compare ourselves to white people for be some but this I feel like I've been to the day I'm Evelyn beating that's all I am and all I know what to do is when that check on that check say my name on it when I read come and said my name on my phone bill dude that's a my name who here was raised in a black Democratic household I want to hear what your reactions are to black voters being synonymous with the Democratic Party well here's the thing the reason that black voters are synonymous with a Democratic Party is because we've been on the receiving end of about 50 years of an onslaught of PR it comes from our entertainers it comes from our ballplayers it comes from our singers it comes from the Democratic politicians who sum up most of which are black and empty but are being used to sell us this idea of the Democratic Party being home of african-american and that is why we vote 90% Democratic now let me tell you something there is not another demographic in the world that votes 9 out of 10 votes for one party why is that still something to be proud of why do we why do we say that we are proud to vote ninety percent of Democrats have to do for us okay gonna get ninety one responsible I think you're kind of essentializing just like black people in general because my perspective of I didn't raise my hand but like I did kind of grow up in a black Democratic household and like my family I came here when I was four from of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa and like my mom didn't know democratic or Republican she just she just knew policies and she was watching the news and she was seeing what policies benefit benefited her and her three children that she was a single mother so like I think that's definitely essentializing the black community just like you're saying you want it to be an event of individual your kind of not doing that but you know essentialize kneisler I don't have to use the example because 90% of us vote a certain way you know so just you know Lucien thinks of the conversation I have to say well if 90% of us are voting a single way like why is that and to me that's a big driver of why yeah and that's an open yourself up for brainwash for a community as well because political leaders they see you voting that much blindly like that they're gonna lie to you and do whatever that as much groupthink as people assume it is as much as it's harm-reduction so one of the things that I often talk about because I'm not Republican I'm not a Democrat I'm just black and I'm George yes yes I talk about what we need to do in our communities right local level macro level micro level right because that's really where it stars voting isn't the beginning voting isn't the ending voting is just a tool in the toolbox that whole toolbox includes us as black people when we do get money and when we do get on and when we do get these things going back and bringing other people along with us not on them because they couldn't pull themselves up by bootstraps again like I always talk about that whole bootstrap argument because some people don't have boots so it's like when you're telling people they can pull themselves out of somewhere some people don't even have anything to pull from what is it about conservative politics that have convinced you that either the Republican Party or conservative politicians of your best interests in mind as black people in America my biggest thing is this I feel like a lot of conservatives they just want to mind their business they want they want to get their hands out of your pot and have you do what they did figure themselves out and I want to go back to student loans because I pay student loans okay I went to school for fashion marketing the merchandizing did not use them use the degree at all it threw the way and I got all this money to pay back so now every month I pay my bills on time every push them on credit and because I paid on time I got good credit you know I'm saying so I'm still able to utilize my credit to go further so for me I'm just asking for the government to make better policies for me to pay back my loans what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna work my business and when I got the money I need I'm gonna pay it off and then went up let me let me answer though and then when I get the chance and I make that money for my kid it's if my kids choose to go to college me as a parent that's my responsibility to make sure that I pay for the education or ship so cuz my kids don't have to go to college if they want our own businesses they can own businesses if they want to get the education they can get you their education and work for their brothers sister who owns a business so my reality is this how is it that the government keep having and keep having to pay back stuff that's our choice in the first place everybody putting no gun and nobody had making nobody go to school you trade if you want to go be a doctor a lawyer you could do that or if you want t

0,"I would like to tell you
 about the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me in my years
 of working as a palliative care physician. This happened a couple of years ago. I was asked as a consultant
 to see a woman in her 70s -- retired English professor
 who had pancreatic cancer. I was asked to see her because
 she had pain, nausea, vomiting ... When I went to see her,
 we talked about those symptoms and in the course of that consultation, she asked me whether I thought
 that medical marijuana might help her. I thought back to everything that I had learned in medical school
 about medical marijuana, which didn't take very long
 because I had learned absolutely nothing. And so I told her that as far as I knew, medical marijuana
 had no benefits whatsoever. And she smiled and nodded and reached
 into the handbag next to the bed, and pulled out a stack of about a dozen
 randomized controlled trials showing that medical
 marijuana has benefits for symptoms like nausea
 and pain and anxiety. She handed me those articles and said, ""Maybe you should read these
 before offering an opinion ... doctor."" (Laughter) So I did. That night I read all of those articles
 and found a bunch more. When I came to see her the next morning, I had to admit that it looks like
 there is some evidence that marijuana can offer medical benefits and I suggested that if she
 really was interested, she should try it. You know what she said? This 73-year-old,
 retired English professor? She said, ""I did try it
 about six months ago. It was amazing. I've been using it every day since. It's the best drug I've discovered. I don't know why it took me 73 years
 to discover this stuff. It's amazing."" (Laughter) That was the moment at which I realized I needed to learn something
 about medical marijuana because what I was prepared for
 in medical school bore no relationship to reality. So I started reading more articles,
 I started talking to researchers, I started talking to doctors, and most importantly,
 I started listening to patients. I ended up writing a book
 based on those conversations, and that book really revolved
 around three surprises -- surprises to me, anyway. One I already alluded to -- that there really are some benefits
 to medical marijuana. Those benefits may not be
 as huge or as stunning as some of the most avid proponents
 of medical marijuana would have us believe, but they are real. Surprise number two: medical marijuana does have some risks. Those risks may not be
 as huge and as scary as some of the opponents of medical
 marijuana would have us believe, but they are real risks, nonetheless. But it was the third surprise
 that was most ... surprising. And that is that a lot
 of the patients I talked with who've turned to medical
 marijuana for help, weren't turning to medical marijuana
 because of its benefits or the balance of risks and benefits, or because they thought
 it was a wonder drug, but because it gave them
 control over their illness. It let them manage their health in a way that was productive and efficient and effective and comfortable for them. To show you what I mean,
 let me tell you about another patient. Robin was in her early 40s when I met her. She looked though
 like she was in her late 60s. She had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis
 for the last 20 years, her hands were gnarled by arthritis, her spine was crooked, she had to rely
 on a wheelchair to get around. She looked weak and frail, and I guess physically she probably was, but emotionally,
 cognitively, psychologically, she was among the toughest
 people I've ever met. And when I sat down next to her in a medical marijuana dispensary
 in Northern California to ask her about why she turned
 to medical marijuana, what it did for her and how it helped her, she started out by telling me things that I had heard
 from many patients before. It helped with her anxiety; it helped with her pain; when her pain was better,
 she slept better. And I'd heard all that before. But then she said something
 that I'd never heard before, and that is that it gave her
 control over her life and over her health. She could use it when she wanted, in the way that she wanted, at the dose and frequency
 that worked for her. And if it didn't work for her,
 then she could make changes. Everything was up to her. The most important thing she said was she didn't need
 anybody else's permission -- not a clinic appointment,
 not a doctor's prescription, not a pharmacist's order. It was all up to her. She was in control. And if that seems like a little thing
 for somebody with chronic illness, it's not -- not at all. When we face a chronic serious illness, whether it's rheumatoid arthritis
 or lupus or cancer or diabetes, or cirrhosis, we lose control. And note what I said: ""when,"" not ""if."" All of us at some point in our lives
 will face a chronic serious illness that causes us to lose control. We'll see our function decline,
 some of us will see our cognition decline, we'll be no longer able
 to care for ourselves, to do the things that we want to do. Our bodies will betray us, and in that process, we'll lose control. And that's scary. Not just scary -- that's frightening, it's terrifying. When I talk to my patients,
 my palliative care patients, many of whom are facing illnesses
 that will end their lives, they have a lot of be frightened of -- pain, nausea, vomiting,
 constipation, fatigue, their impending mortality. But what scares them
 more than anything else is this possibility that at some point, tomorrow or a month from now, they're going to lose
 control of their health, of their lives, of their healthcare, and they're going to become
 dependent on others, and that's terrifying. So it's no wonder really
 that patients like Robin, who I just told you about, who I met in that clinic, turn to medical marijuana to try to claw back
 some semblance of control. How do they do it though? How do these medical
 marijuana dispensaries -- like the one where I met Robin -- how do they give patients like Robin
 back the sort of control that they need? And how do they do it in a way that mainstream
 medical hospitals and clinics, at least for Robin, weren't able to? What's their secret? So I decided to find out. I went to a seedy clinic
 in Venice Beach in California and got a recommendation that would allow me
 to be a medical marijuana patient. I got a letter of recommendation
 that would let me buy medical marijuana. I got that recommendation illegally, because I'm not
 a resident of California -- I should note that. I should also note, for the record, that I never used that letter
 of recommendation to make a purchase, and to all of you DEA agents out there -- (Laughter) love the work that you're doing, keep it up. (Laughter) Even though it didn't let me
 make a purchase though, that letter was priceless
 because it let me be a patient. It let me experience
 what patients like Robin experience when they go to a medical
 marijuana dispensary. And what I experienced -- what they experience every day, hundreds of thousands
 of people like Robin -- was really amazing. I walked into the clinic, and from the moment that I entered
 many of these clinics and dispensaries, I felt like that dispensary, that clinic, was there for me. There were questions
 at the outset about who I am, what kind of work I do, what my goals are in looking
 for a medical marijuana prescription, or product, what my goals are,
 what my preferences are, what my hopes are, how do I think, how do I hope
 this might help me, what am I afraid of. These are the sorts of questions that patients like Robin
 get asked all the time. These are the sorts of questions
 that make me confident that the person I'm talking with
 really has my best interests at heart and wants to get to know me. The second thing I learned
 in those clinics is the availability of education. Education from the folks
 behind the counter, but also education
 from folks in the waiting room. People I met were more than happy,
 as I was sitting next to them -- people like Robin -- to tell me about who they are,
 why they use medical marijuana, what helps them, how it helps them, and to give me advice and suggestions. Those waiting rooms really are
 a hive of interaction, advice and support. And third, the folks behind the counter. I was amazed at how willing
 those people were to spend sometimes an hour or more
 talking me through the nuances of this strain versus that strain, smoking versus vaporizing, edibles versus tinctures -- all, remember, without me
 making any purchase whatsoever. Think about the last time
 you went to any hospital or clinic and the last time anybody spent an hour
 explaining those sorts of things to you. The fact that patients like Robin
 are going to these clinics, are going to these dispensaries and getting that sort
 of personalized attention and education and service, really should be a wake-up call
 to the healthcare system. People like Robin are turning away
 from mainstream medicine, turning to medical marijuana dispensaries because those dispensaries
 are giving them what they need. If that's a wake-up call
 to the medical establishment, it's a wake-up call that many
 of my colleagues are either not hearing or not wanting to hear. When I talk to my colleagues,
 physicians in particular, about medical marijuana, they say, ""Oh, we need more evidence. We need more research into benefits,
 we need more evidence about risks."" And you know what? They're right. They're absolutely right. We do need much more evidence
 about the benefits of medical marijuana. We also need to ask the federal government
 to reschedule marijuana to Schedule II, or to deschedule it entirely
 to make that research possible. We also need more research
 into medical marijuana's risks. Medical marijuana's risks -- we know a lot about
 the risks of recreational use, we know next to nothing
 about the risks of medical marijuana. So we absolutely do need research, but to say that we need research and not that we need
 to make any changes now is to miss the point entirely. People like Robin
 aren't seeking out medical marijuana because they think it's a wonder drug, or because they think
 it's entirely risk-free. They seek it out because the context
 in which it's delivered and administered and used, gives them the sort of control
 they need over their lives. And that's a wake-up call
 we really need to pay attention to. The good news though is that
 there are lessons we can learn today from those medical marijuana dispensaries. And those are lessons
 we really should learn. These are often small,
 mom-and-pop operations run by people with no medical training. And while it's embarrassing to think that many of these clinics
 and dispensaries are providing services and support and meeting patients' needs in ways that billion-dollar
 healthcare systems aren't -- we should be embarrassed by that -- but we can also learn from that. And there are probably
 three lessons at least that we can learn
 from those small dispensaries. One: we need to find ways
 to give patients more control in small but important ways. How to interact with healthcare providers, when to interact
 with healthcare providers, how to use medications
 in ways that work for them. In my own practice, I've gotten much more
 creative and flexible in supporting my patients
 in using drugs safely to manage their symptoms -- with the emphasis on safely. Many of the drugs I prescribe
 are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines which can be dangerous if overused. But here's the point. They can be dangerous if they're overused, but they can also be ineffective
 if they're not used in a way that's consistent with
 what patients want and need. So that flexibility,
 if it's delivered safely, can be extraordinarily valuable
 for patients and their families. That's number one. Number two: education. Huge opportunities to learn from some of the tricks
 of those medical marijuana dispensaries to provide more education that doesn't require
 a lot of physician time necessarily, or any physician time, but opportunities to learn
 about what medications we're using and why, prognoses, trajectories of illness, and most importantly, opportunities for patients
 to learn from each other. How can we replicate what goes on in those clinic and medical
 dispensary waiting rooms? How patients learn from each other,
 how people share with each other. And last but not least, putting patients first the way
 those medical marijuana dispensaries do, making patients feel
 legitimately like what they want, what they need, is why, as healthcare providers, we're here. Asking patients about their hopes,
 their fears, their goals and preferences. As a palliative care provider, I ask all my patients what they're
 hoping for and what they're afraid of. But here's the thing. Patients shouldn't have to wait
 until they're chronically seriously ill, often near the end of life, they shouldn't have to wait
 until they're seeing a physician like me before somebody asks them, ""What are you hoping for?"" ""What are you afraid of?"" That should be baked into the way
 that healthcare is delivered. We can do this -- we really can. Medical marijuana dispensaries
 and clinics all across the country are figuring this out. They're figuring this out in ways that larger, more mainstream
 health systems are years behind. But we can learn from them, and we have to learn from them. All we have to do is swallow our pride -- put aside the thought for a minute that because we have
 lots of letters after our name, because we're experts, because we're chief medical officers
 of a large healthcare system, we know all there is to know
 about how to meet patients' needs. We need to swallow our pride. We need to go visit
 a few medical marijuana dispensaries. We need to figure out what they're doing. We need to figure out
 why so many patients like Robin are leaving our mainstream medical clinics and going to these medical
 marijuana dispensaries instead. We need to figure out
 what their tricks are, what their tools are, and we need to learn from them. If we do, and I think we can,
 and I absolutely think we have to, we can guarantee all of our patients
 will have a much better experience. Thank you. (Applause)"
0,thank you for being my spiritual teacher you've really helped me a lot you say in the power of now that you are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold could you please explain what the divine purpose of the universe is the universe wants to awaken consciousness coming into that this dimension is the divine purpose but the divine purpose is twofold one is the universe delights in creation it delights in creativity its alights in creating new forms how do I know that well just look around on the planet here the millions of life forms in the sea on land the air it is the universe delights in in creating this multiplicity of forms and it delights in experiencing itself through all those forms because you are not say separate entity it's not the case as sometimes the ego ego itself believes the here's me and there's the rest of the world of the universe or the ego things that that it is in the universe it's somehow suddenly appeared fallen into this universe and then where am i you I'm in this universe you're not in the universe you are the universe the one life expressing itself through countless life forms and there is a growing complexity in life-forms and with every experience the universe is experiencing itself as your life is extremely differentiated in human beings the way in which life or the universe or the one con justise experiences itself in this dreamlike world is extremely differentiated it is amazing that every human being is different of those billions of humans on the planet every human not only looks different you could recognize if you know one person out of these billions I can't remember how many billions on the planet now you could recognize this person out of billions of other human beings just by looking at their face this is how different it is on this surface layer level already and then every life experienced of course there are many similarities but there's a uniqueness to every life experience of every life experience is a world that arises and subsides my mother's life was your mother's life your parents life anybody's life was a particular world the way she experienced the world was very different from the way I experienced it like my mother and I and I'm just taking one example from my personal experience seemed to inhabit completely different universes but we were in the same place but experiencing life in a totally totally different way and the university lights in that complexity of experience so it wants to experience its self s form it means and through the forms become evolving more more complex the humans that are alive now have far greater complexity than the human said we're alive ten thousand years ago or fifty thousand years ago life at that time was more simple gather the food gather the plants or hunt an animal if they were did that prepare the meal go out hunting come back home so fairly simple there wasn't the complexity of New York City la freeways and all that that's behind that couldn't either nuclear physics whatever and so on and so the University lights in that and you are an expression of that it wants to become conscious of itself through use and it's doing that attempting to do that through humans but you know that that one consciousness is not separate from you you are an expression of it but the universe also wants to know itself deeply its own source it wants the source realization also so I could I know that because I I know it by looking it within myself there is an outgoing movement into creation and there's a return movement it wants to realize itself in its essence the universe wants beause it wants to go out and create it once also wants to realize its own essence through you in human life that expresses as wanting to do things in this life wanting to contribute to this life wanting to create something to make something of your life your so-called life it expresses as that it is pretend the other the return movement so you have the outward movement of the universe the return movement expresses s coming totally into the present moment stepping away from becoming into being becoming is the outward movement what can I do now I need to do something I want to create this I feel that this wants to there's something coming through me I feel a piece of music wants to come through it a book wants to be written or something whatever I want to do this or create this set up this business of that whatever and then it's becoming doing but then there's another movement that says I just want to be and be still and this present moment go deeply into this moment I don't need to become anything at all I just want to be fully Who I am already and go deeply into being so you have it's almost this contradictory movements in some humans the outward tendency is greater in others the inward tendency is greater both are necessary and some are both need to be there as long as you're here in a human form both to some extent will be in you but there will be different to different degrees some are much more going within and to being to the source but I would suggest that it's not either/or there are certain spiritual traditions that look upon it as most either/or they say forget about the world just realize who you are and then you can just sit in a corner for the rest of your life and never do anything again you don't need to that's one way but it's for us it's finding a certain balance which doesn't mean it needs to be up totally in balance there very few humans who are totally balanced between the outward movement of creating and the inward movement of coordinate connecting with you with your inner being and the source of all life you need to have both so that you the universe can creates through you without losing itself in its creations so you can create not from a place of egoic need where you depend on the outcome if I don't get that I'll kill myself if I don't achieve if I don't get famous and rich I I don't know what I'll do not that but a playful participation in the world of form and and contributing to it to the world of form without losing itself in the creation and in the doing what if you become stressed means you're losing yourself in the doing this is more important and she completely you become uprooted you're no longer connected to the spaciousness the unconditioned can't the one within so two to be and do at the same time but some humans yes are much more drawn to being I call them frequency holders they hold the frequency of being on the planet they they're not interested in creating huge things out there they're interesting doing perhaps little things gardening cooking looking after animals being with animals helping humans in some capacity helping even physical helping humans with their bodies and so on so their frequency hold us they they're more into being then there's some doing but you cannot you always have to do something you can't do but they don't put the emphasis on doing the emphasis on being and then they allow presence to flow into what they do and they affect the world also very significantly others have a greater tendency to performing creative action and they need to go out there and become active but their challenge is not to get lost in what they do and in thinking that's all important they forget that this is a play or form and then there comes a seriousness into heaviness into the doing and they get unhappy and we are unhappy whatever you create has some flavor of that unhappiness so the divine purpose of the universe to summarize my long explanation is to know itself bows through the creation of form and through realization of of the formless essence of all life and that is the divine purpose of the universe and that you are here as part of that that's it you
0,I wouldn't dare try I don't even want the possibility of becoming addicted to something that is going to make me physically dependent upon it my name is Kayla and I'm a recovery advocate hi my name is Chris and I'm a cannabis abdicating hi my name is Devin and I'm fascinated with mental health my name is Juan comedic one-sided such what there's an area that the gringos JC and I am Pro these things that are grow out of the ground and make us shift our perspective my name is key I am honestly middle ground my name is Kiki Dexter and I'm here pro-marijuana so my sister went to rehab for extensive drugs usage it affected her life very heavily and was in rehab cost my parents a lot of time and energy money and just emotional draining for the whole family my dad is a very adamantly trying recovering heroin addict I think he first got addicted when he was like 20 21 it was the influx of drugs into the cities in the 80s it still affects his life I had a physical dependence on prescription anti-anxiety medication klonopin specifically for like seven years I went to treatment like three years ago and eventually found my way back I would consider myself sober I've been sober for like two and a half years alcohol played a big role in my life marijuana played a big role in my life I didn't notice going into my 20s that the pattern that I do have a propensity to want to get don't drink or at least that's my intention but there comes a time when it's like cool I think I could go for a nice LSD trip and woods that'd be nice people often become emotionally dependent on recreational drugs yeah I think they do um for example I had a great childhood but I was sexually abused nobody knew what was going on how do you by the time I was 14 I was using whatever I could get my hands on to deal with the emotional turmoil that I was dealing with inside and when we're so young we have traumatic events or we have these situations and these circumstances that stick with us and we don't know how to process them and so we reach out to whatever's closest to is food addiction drug addiction I think it's it's good to establish a distinction between recreational use and habitual use because that's something I heard you guys talking about and I don't feel that people really become emotionally dependent when they're recreationally using it when they're habitually using it when they're using it to solve problems then it does become an issue because you're not dealing with balance at that point I mean you're tipping one way on the scale you're clearly going to affect other areas and get sick I don't know what I think actually I agree sup guys this is the heart one for me I just had a hone in on that word moderation like if I'm smoking once or twice a week that's fine but if I'm smoking every day of my life every second I get up and I can't function then a you know of course that's when there's a red line I wouldn't say like using things like heroin or cocaine like use not a moderation I think that's just harmful but if we're talking about the subject of marijuana and that use yeah well here's why I disagree I think there are levels to this I don't think all drugs are safe even in moderation like you take a wrong Molly or whatever the percocet pill is like you know like people have died from that and that was technically in moderation one pill one day life gone you know like same thing with heroin like that's something that could drastically change your life in a day the moderation part of it is tough because with pharmaceuticals mainly to me you mix two those things you're gone and that's terrifying yeah and there are so many circumstances where it only takes one time to become physically dependent even in in my case um I take prescription medication for sleeping I hate that I'm on it and I hate that I have to use it to function if you don't have to absolutely do it why do it so let me ask you this so what's the distinction for you between that and like ayahuasca peyote DMT different it's not necessary I think there's this a distinction that I know I'm gonna invite you to look at it's like there is a difference between cocaine oh I was right but what I'm saying is neither aren't necessary my question to you is are you saying to all the young people like you will not be able to open your mind fully unless you go and do this no what I'm saying is that I hold everybody high and I hold everybody with the ability to think for themselves but also going out and having an intentional purposeful responsible encounter with mushrooms or LSD supported me in getting over my addiction to marijuana and alcohol but the point being is the safety issue and what you might have gone in that moment when you took the drugs and it opened your mind and you were able to realize a lot of stuff I think people should do on their own without the drugs drugs reduce people's potential I think even with psychedelic drugs you know to the point earlier even if they are opening your mind of that's really not your potential that's not your potential your potential is the organic potential and a lot of your organic self is wonderful and it is marvelous and if you take a little time to work and develop that muscle like a talent then you will be able to reach your fullest potential when I got sober I went back to school which I never thought I would do I work two jobs I started a small business like I think of all of the people who are usually hypersensitive and end up getting into drugs because they can't deal with our emotions and all those people could be potentially adding to society and they're not because they're in their own world so I really don't feel that they harm people's potential and I think that helped people gain their potential in a lot of different ways and I mean with cannabis alone I mean we have an endocannabinoid system within our body I mean it's one of our main receptors it within our brain that it's like a lock and key for cannabis it's we're made of the same materials our brain synthesizes those materials within it so I I really do feel that our potential isn't high hindered by drugs I mean some totally I can see some 100% but overall natural ones not at all some of the most powerful people in the world right now in Silicon Valley and creating some of the most powerful startups are all micro dosing totally two years ago I did had my first mushroom experience so I went into the woods I went in nature I set the intention I'm gonna have this experience that I've never had before it was a remarkable experience and I felt a deeper truth within my connection to the earth something I hadn't had in a long time and it was kind of reconnection with my spirituality I relate to you because I also come from a very spiritual background I think wherever that framework is for you like if it's drugs then that's for you I think that's a dangerous path I also think that for me that that thing is God you know like me having faith in God in a relationship with God that is that is the opening to my spirituality like I don't need to take drugs to get there have you done stuck it on so it's it's like someone that hasn't done had sex talking about why no it's not that's not what it's like at all like it because but the thing is I don't need to know that's my point - my point is you don't need to know you have you do do you have a relationship with Christ you know have you spoken in tongues that doesn't mean anything that's a cross it's not a relationship it's not a relationship the two are very different that's my point so you don't have to ask me what I did not do what I said was and I repeat it my experience and my relationship with Christ for me that supersedes my desire to even go into that path because I find myself very happy very successful very I'm thriving within my being and I don't need the substitution there is a lot of false information about recreational drugs it's like based on the culture the perception and I'm strictly talking about marijuana but you know at one point in history it was also used for medicine it was it was used for religion it was used for you know for hip was used for a variety of things like so and there's people that don't know that it's a part of our history so when I think about how ill informed people are that's one of the main things but the truth is like do I really want all of the information I'll be honest no I don't I don't I don't really need it you know I agree with the statement that's why I walked over because I will agree that like there are there's a lot that I don't know about recreational drugs and I think that there's a lot that most people don't know yeah I mean I walked over for the same thing I try and keep an open mind at all times and realized that a wise man knows that he knows nothing so especially with cannabis in that I'm aware and have researched you know cannabis oils and taken CBD and myself and I am interested in as someone who takes pharmaceutical medication as cannabis as an alternative but my perspective and once again versus recreational versus I would consider that for me medical use there's a great deal of misinformation I mean just like the pharmaceutical guy I mean we have all these things that are getting pumped into our homes all the time with all of these side effects and side effects the side effects more than half the commercial it's all side effects yet it's selling it's okay to take that it's cool to take that yeah you can probably kill you but it's okay to take that but you can't takes each other yeah take this one and take this one but don't take this thing over here that can actually help you exactly and I think that's because there are people that benefit from are exactly like that's not being literal but I have to realize like why why we're here for this video is pushing information and for recreational drug purposes and like the misinformation but I think that it takes a lot more education and usually a really bad circumstance for you to want to change around your life and be like be more than this but most people never get uncomfortable enough to need to make that realization and so I'm I'm just not going to push it because I just think that it's going to end up way more negative unfortunately people hey guys it's Kendra from Jubilee media

0,"- Did I get you right? - Yeah, yeah. - You've got fish teeth. (laughing) - Is that bad? - No, it's Pisces. - No. (laughing) (classical music playing) - My name is Ray Couture. I'm a professional astrologer. Between 45 and 50 years. Not in a group setting, but wherever I am I look
 at somebody and say, are you a Pisces? And sometimes they say, yeah, and sometimes they say,
 none of your business. (laughing) - Hi, what's your name? - Nathaniel. - 5'10. - Can I see your profile? Oh, okay. You're Scorpio. - What makes me a Scorpio to you? - Hmm. - How are you sir? - Hi, how are you? When you were growing up what kind of problems did
 you have with your parents? - They could never decide if they wanted to be together or not. - Do you worry a lot? - Absolutely, mainly about my son. - Just face that way. Oh, the ears of a Capricorn
 are just chiseled. I'll go with Virgo. - Okay. - Changing that to Libra. He accepted it too fast. (laughing) I have to watch how people act too. What did you study in college? - I didn't go to college. - Do you travel? - Mm hmm. - Like, would you say a lot? - A lot. - Your hands. Whether they're fingers or claws. - What do I have? - Put 'em up this way
 and then turn 'em around. And I'll see it that way. You have fingers, no claws. Sagittarius. - Thank you. - Yeah, you're welcome. How tall are you? - 6'1. - Are you an artist? or somebody hands you
 something to proofread, first thing you see is
 what's wrong with it? - Yeah, I'd say so. - What color are your eyes? - Uh, Hazel, I think. S- Hazelish, ah. And we'll go with Aquarius
 and leave it like that. - Okay. - Do people consider you weird,
 a little bit off the wall? - Yeah. - 12:41 p.m. Let me ask you this, in relationships, are you sort of like a dog on a bone? I got this, this is mine. - Yeah.
 - Yeah. - Yeah. - Taurus, okay, thank you. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. (laughing) Oh you are different, aren't you? (laughing) Challenging, bet you can't
 tell who I am kind of attitude. (laughs) If you were to draw a circle, how close to an oval would it be? Instead of a circle. - It would probably be an oval. - A little wild here and there, right? - Yes. - Pisces, thank you. Ah, here you go. - Thank you. - Who's next? Let me see your hand. So you're independent thinker? - Yeah. (laughing) - I'm married to a transgender, so your trans and I appreciate
 the courage and the work. - I appreciate that. - Goes into actually
 becoming who you really are. - Yeah. - So there's enormous amount of change involved in that process. There you are, Cancer. - Okay, thank you. - Okay, your ears, oh okay. All right. Well, it could be Capricorn ear. Capricorns have nothing to spare. Everything is usable it has
 to be used and so forth. I'm gonna I'm gonna
 try Capricorn with you. It could be Aquarius, so I
 might change later, okay? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hi, what's your name? - Amalia. - Hmm. (laughing) She puts her foot forward, you know. When you were growing up,
 what did you want to be? - Like a leader or like
 actress or something like fun. An entertainer for sure. - Now do you like to
 control things around you? - Yes, I like it my way. - Most Leos are like that. - Oh, okay. (laughing) - Here I am. (laughing) - Bye. - This is fun. (laughing) I don't care if I get any of them right. (laughing) - Do you know that women or men or people with red hair have a
 lot of Neanderthal DNA? (laughing) - Haven't heard that one yet, no. - Is that your natural color? - It is.
 - Yeah, okay. Can I see your hands? - Yes. They look like Neanderthal hands? (laughing) - Final answer is Aries. - Hello, hello my Gemini, how are you? - I'm good, how are you? - Where did you go to school? - I did not go to college,
 I became a wife and mom. - In that order? - Yes. - Good for you. (laughing) - We had children way
 after we got married. - Argue a lot? - Ha, no he doesn't argue with me. I'm argumentative, but he just kind of. - You're argumentative? - Yes. - So you win every argument? - I do. - Yeah, okay you're a Gemini. - Hi. - So all we do here is
 say are you a Virgo? (laughing) - I wish it were that easy. - Could I see your ears again? The Capricorn thing is gone, okay. Switch signs with him. - Is this is your final answer? - I think so. - Okay. - So there you have it. I'm afraid, but sure. (laughing) That's not too bad. (laughing) I don't know, none of 'em apparently. (laughing) - Okay, I'm a weirdo,
 got that wrong though. - You're a nice weirdo
 though, you're nice weird. You're different, you know. Yeah, he's in the middle of an eclipse for the last four or five months struggling with this whole process of how you're gonna deal with this. - He's not wrong. (laughing) - So you got me wrong
 but my mother is a Virgo and we're very close, so you might be feeling her presence. - It could be because you're a Cancer and you carry a moon with you and you carry your mother with you. You're very warm and
 when you don't feel good, you're getting a little needy and so you call mom. - And that's why the girls run away. (groaning) - What made you think I was a Sag? - It just felt so honest, so dedicated to truth. - Between you and me, I don't really believe
 in astrology too much. - I know I do. - Really? - It's not you shouldn't believe in it. When you're born, you
 take in all this stuff and you manifest whatever that kind of consciousness is. Now your consciousness has got to do with staying on a high road, always
 to be truthful and honest and you cannot stand a liar, you just (puffing) maybe after this you'd be more interested in
 finding out more about astrology because you're capable of learning. - Okay, well thank you so
 much for guessing me right. - Thank you for coming here and exposing yourself to this. (laughing) - How did I not do that? - I got Aquarius. - Did I get Virgo for you the first time? - No, Aquarius. - I had Aquarius.
 - Yeah. - Wow, what was wrong with me? (laughing) How did I not know that? - I'm an Aries and you
 guessed me as a Taurus. - Yes, you're a Taurus. - I was born April 19th,
 so I'm at the cusp, so if it's near the cusp
 from Aries to Taurus. You'll have Taurus qualities as well as Aries qualities and so that turns out to be your problem. The Aries wants to go and a Taurus says is it worth it, should I really do this and so forth? So you have to sort of
 balance all those things. - Thank you so much. - Welcome, all right. Did I get you right? - Yeah, yeah. - Got fish teeth. (laughing) - Is that bad? - No, it's Pisces. - No. (laughing) - What are you studying? - I'm a film student. - Film student, so you want to connect with people through picture? - Yes. - Right. And your grandmother was really, really important in your life? - Yeah. - Extremely important,
 she took care of you. - Yeah. - You had to get what you needed from her because it wasn't coming from mom and pop. - Yeah. (laughing) - Hi, the Virgo thing is that you have something
 to offer the world and part of that is gonna
 be you know with writing. - I'm a writer, I mean I'm an editor too, I
 was an editor for a long time. - So you got to keep writing, don't stop. - Thanks, tell your spouse
 that I said more power to them. - Oh, I'll tell Madeline, fine, thank you. - You guessed me right. - What's your birthday? - December 24th. - So you've already gone through, I won't call it a near-death experience. You were hanging on the edges for a while about three years ago or maybe even four. You did the right thing, you had to do the right thing. - I think so. (awing) - You got me right. - I got you right? - Mm hmm. Didn't you have difficulties until you're about 18 feeling worthless or not valuable. - Yeah. - It was in college? You ran into somebody who told you how great you really are. - Yeah. - Well, when I know
 what time and so forth, I can really figure this out, but you know just the sun
 sign is a little hard. - I met my biological mom when I was 19. - Ah. - Oh my God, yeah. - And she said I love you. - Yeah. (laughing) - I'm stunned right now. - So what do you think
 about astrology (mumbles)? - Zodiac itself I think is
 a little too broad and vague and can apply to everybody else. - Do you know what time were you born? - I don't know.
 - Not at all, nothing. - No, I have no clue. I'm more concerned about my death time than I am when I was born. - Do you have any other way to waste time? - To waste time? - Sure, thinking about death, I mean. - I don't think a lot about it. - Oh, you don't?
 - No. - Okay, so you're a Gemini, I see how you go from
 one side of an issue. (laughing) - You got me, you got me. - Keeps floating that way. - He's a magnet. (laughing) So what time were you born. - Uh, 6:15 a.m. - 6:15 morning Taurus, sun
 just came up (mumbles). Just some unfinished business, that's been sitting around for a while. Actually, thinking of a school again. - Yeah, I started actually started doing school about a year ago, but then we had some bad stuff unless I actually passed away, so I stopped. - Who passed? - My son.
 - Your son. - Yeah. You still have a reason to live. Your son is still with you, he's still encouraging you. You can move forward and he would definitely appreciate that. It's alright. - Okay. - Have faith in yourself. - Thank you. - Welcome. - So you're a Scorpio? - That's me. - People go woo la la. (laughing) - I think a lot of people's
 perceptions about Scorpios, they're just really intense
 and more mysterious. I can see myself as intense, not quite mysterious, but I could see how it it
 could be to a certain extent. - The thing about Scorpio despite the fact that you
 really just like this, you have to have a relationship. - Do I have to? (laughing) Can't I just, can't it
 just be my work like. (laughing) - Oh yeah, it was a lot of fun. Thank you, thank you,
 thank you, thank you. (applauding)"

 Reviewer: Leonardo Silva Hi. I'm Maisie Williams. And I'm kind of just waiting
 for someone to come on stage and tell me that there's been
 some sort of miscommunication, and that I should probably leave. No? Damn it. (Laughter) So, some of you may know me as an actress. (Cheers) (Laughter) Some of you may know me
 for my really average tweets. (Cheers) Oh, yeah. And some of you may be finding out
 who I am for the first time right now. Hello. Whether you knew me before or not, you're probably wondering
 what I'm going to talk to you about today. And I would be lying if I said it didn't take me
 one or two sleepless nights, trying to figure that out, too. At last, here I am. Upon finding out the news
 that I would be giving a TEDx Talk, I did what I think most people do and watched about
 50 TED talks back-to-back, and read ""Talk like TED""
 by Carmine Gallo for some inspiration. Was I inspired? Yes and no. Did it make me want to go out
 and change the world? Hell yeah. Did it make me feel like a totally
 inadequate public speaker with absolutely no point to make, who was definitely in need of a big
 thesaurus if she wants to keep up? Indeed. What could I possibly say
 that would have any impact? What point am I trying to make? And who the hell thought
 it was a good idea to give me a TEDx talk? So here's the part
 where I tell you what I know: I'm the youngest of four siblings. My parents divorced
 when I was four months old. I really was the icing on the cake
 of a terrible marriage. (Laughter) I have two step siblings
 who are younger than me and a half brother
 who's older than all of us. I grew up in a three-bedroom council house with four of my six siblings
 just outside of Bristol. I went to a very ordinary school. I got very ordinary grades. I wasn't quite good enough
 to get a gold star, and I also wasn't quite bad enough
 to be kept after school. I walked that nice center line
 where if I kept my mouth shut in class, then I could probably get away with not being spoken to you
 by teachers for weeks on end. Everything about me
 was pretty damn ordinary, except for how I felt on the inside. I had big dreams. Shock. From as young as I can remember, I have dreamed of becoming
 a professional dancer. There are certain memories
 from my childhood that I would really rather forget. But during those times of immense pain, I found myself instinctively walking over
 to my mother's CD player, cranking up the volume
 to drown out the noise and letting my body move to the beat. It's hard to describe how it felt. I was harnessing emotions that I didn't
 even really know the names of yet. I was summoning all of this energy and feeling it flow through my body
 and out of my fingertips. I was alone in my own head,
 and I felt the most alive. I didn't really know much
 about the big wide world then, but I knew that this feeling
 was addictive; and I was going to stop at nothing
 until I made it my profession. At eight years old,
 I was enrolled in dance class. And by ten, I informed my mother that I didn't want
 to go to school anymore. I wanted to be like Billy Elliot
 and go to stage school. This was the first opportunity
 or challenge I was presented with. Even as young as ten, I was willing to give up all of my friends
 and go away to board at a private school, away from my siblings, away from my mom. She would repeatedly ask me,
 ""Are you sure this is what you want?"" And to me, it was a no-brainer. I didn't just want this; I needed it. My grubby knees and crooked teeth
 were not on the list of requirements for becoming a professional dancer. And when I look back now, both myself and my mother
 looked severely out of place. But at the time, I was just too young
 and naive to feel inadequate. I didn't care. If Billy Elliot could do it, so could I. Once my audition was done, I returned home
 for two weeks of staring out the window, waiting for the postman, waiting for my ticket
 out of my sleepy village and into a world of jazz hands
 and dorm rooms. It was good news followed by bad news: I had got in, but the fees to attend
 a school like this were not cheap, and despite my best efforts,
 I had not received any government funding. I auditioned again the following year. And this time, I received 40% funding, but this was still just money
 that we didn't have, and it broke my heart. I was good enough. I made the cut. But I wasn't going anywhere. It was a blessing in disguise, although if anyone had said that
 to me back then, I probably would've given them the finger
 and told them to jog on. I wasn't willing to give up that easily. So at age 11, I was bursting
 with excitement when my dance teacher
 informed me of a talent show which boasted opportunities
 of making you a star. This was the second opportunity
 I was faced with. I entered into singing, acting, dancing and modeling. The talent show consisted
 of workshops and seminars with specialists who would help
 train you up for your performance at the end of the week. After meeting a woman
 called Louise Johnston in an improvisation acting workshop, she gave me the words ""bowling ball,"" and asked me to create a short scene
 inspired by these words. After making her laugh
 with a fictional story, of how I threw a bowling ball
 at my brother and it bounced, she asked me to join her acting agency. I didn't really know what this meant. I knew that I would do auditions
 for films and maybe become an actor, but I still had big dreams
 of becoming a professional dancer, so this woman was going
 to have to work a lot harder than that if she was going to convince
 eleven-year-old me that I was going to become an actress. Was this going to take time away from the 30 hours of dancing
 I was doing a week? And what if I didn't get the part? Was this going to be too upsetting? And do actresses have teeth like mine? Because if they do,
 I'm yet to watch any of their movies. After meeting Louise
 in the February of 2009 and trying but failing to land the part in the hit sequel ""Nanny McPhee""
 to ""The Big Bang,"" my second audition was for a show
 called ""Game of Thrones."" This was the third opportunity
 or challenge I was presented with. I climbed the steps
 to the Methodist Church with my mother's hand in mine. I perched my tiny bottom in one
 of the seats outside the audition room and listened to an annoying girl
 with her even more annoying mother tell me all about the number of auditions
 she had done prior to this one. And also about her pet fish. My name was called, then I stepped inside. I had a hard Bristolian accent and dark rings around my eyes that were
 so big they took up half my face and a hole in the knee of my trousers
 which I tried to cover with my left hand as I was talking to the kind lady
 who taped my audition. But as soon as she pressed record, it all drifted away. Much like when I was dancing
 in my mother's living room, I harnessed all of
 my insecurities and self-doubt and let it flow through the words
 that came out of my mouth. I was cheeky. I was loud. I was angry. And for this, I was perfect. After getting the part
 and shooting the pilot episode, the show slowly grew to become one of the biggest shows
 in television history. To this day, we've smashed
 previous HBO viewing records. We've been nominated for over 130 Emmys, making us the most Emmy-nominated
 show to ever exist. We've recently finished shooting
 our eighth and final season, which is predicted to smash records
 that we've already broken. And nearly a decade to the day
 since my first audition, I'm still wondering, when am I going to get to be Billy Elliot? (Laughter) I joke, but in all seriousness, I have
 absolutely no plans of slowing down. Throughout my time in this industry,
 it has been a minefield. I have grown from a child into an adult, and from four feet tall
 into a whopping five feet tall. (Laughter) I have constantly been trying
 to say the right thing, accidentally saying the wrong thing, trying not to swear too much and trying to stop saying
 ""like, like"" all of the time. In February of 2017, a friend of mine, Dom, and I
 were swigging beers in my kitchen, and he confessed to me that there is a huge problem
 with the creative industries. I agreed. The series of events
 that had got me to that point were based mainly on luck and timing
 and were unable to be recreated. He suggested to me
 that we create a social media, but just for artists to be able
 to collaborate with one another and create a career. This was the fourth opportunity
 or challenge I was presented with. ""Great,"" I thought. ""How the hell do we do that?"" And daisie was born. Of course, everyone who I spoke to about
 my latest endeavor thought that I was mad; however, I know that this is something
 that I can help change. This last year in the industry, we've seen
 a huge shift with the Me Too movement. The industry is built with gatekeepers
 holding all of the power and selecting who they deem talented
 enough to advance to the next level. More often than not, it's easier
 to catch the attention of those people if you have graduated
 from an expensive school. But even then, I have so many friends
 who are fresh out of art school, having trained for years and are still
 no closer to creating a career. Now, I'm not claiming that with daisie
 I can make everybody a star, but I do believe that the key to success within creative
 industries is collaborating. Actors are only as good as their writers. Musicians are only as strong
 as their producers. And designers need their teams. To start the company, we self-funded. I had a pot of cash from ""Game of Thrones"" that I was free to invest
 wherever I liked. Dom had a series of businesses
 from the age of 16, which meant he was also left
 with a pot of cash. We threw our money together 50-50,
 and we built a team. Now, Lady Gaga has repeatedly said that there could be a room of 100 people,
 and 99 don't believe in you, but it just takes that one person
 to believe in you, and they can change your life. Well, now we have a team of six. Over the next 16 months, we built our MVP. Now, if you're wondering what an MVP is, I only found out what it is
 about six months ago. And from what I can gather, it's a product
 which proves as a problem worth solving with the minimum team effort. So basically from my point of view,
 you're marketing something which you know
 is going to be good one day, but is a little bit bad right now. And for us, that was an iOS app. The six of us made an office
 in Dom's garden, and on August 1, 2018,
 we released our version one. We had over 30,000 downloads
 in the first 24 hours and over 30,000 comments asking when the Android version
 was going to be coming. Despite our app being imperfect, buggy
 and literally built by one man alone, this was exactly what we needed
 for people to invest. We learned a lot from our angry users
 and our scary investors. And over the last six months,
 we have grown our team to 16 people. From then till now,
 we've been building version two, which we will be launching in April. Within the industry, there is a common phrase which I think
 we're all pretty familiar with. And that is, ""It's not what you know,
 it's who you know."" And with daisie, I hope to give
 that power back to the creator. I want to encourage people
 to create a list of contacts that they will work with and support
 as they take their first steps into the fickle and often
 challenging creative world. I am of the generation
 who grew up with the Internet. I've never known anything else. We are connected, we are aware,
 and we are the future. I hope daisie can breathe new life into the slightly dystopian,
 ad-riddled hellscapes that social media platforms have become. I hope to create a space where people
 can boast their art and creativity rather than what car they are driving and whether or not they bought it
 in cash or on finance. In a world where literally
 anyone can be famous, I hope to inspire people
 to be talented instead. Talent will carry you so much further
 than your 15 minutes of fame. So why am I telling you all this? The very fact that I'm here
 giving a TEDx talk right now is so far from anything
 I thought that I was capable of. Even writing the bio
 for my speech made me realize that in a decade,
 everything in my life has changed. I am an Emmy-nominated actress,
 an entrepreneur and an activist; yet I have no formal
 qualifications to my name. When I left school about seven years ago,
 I made it my mission to continue learning even though I never wanted
 to set foot in a classroom again. Who knows what's going to happen
 to my life in the next 10 years? I surely have no idea. I've never had an end goal. It's working out okay so far. So trust that you're good enough. If there's one thing that I've learned is
 that there truly is a place for everyone. Ask questions, and laugh in the face of people
 who say that they're stupid questions. Be open to learning and admitting when you don't know
 what the hell is going on. Refuse to hold yourself back, and dare to dream big. Thank you for listening. (Applause)"
0,hi my name is Linden I'm 7 years old and today here are two chefs competing to make my dream hi Linda I'm Alex hi I'm Rhea if you were a fairy what would you eat I would eat a shooting star with pixie dust at the end and see just water seems pretty right to me and then this star but she needs die what does it taste like it tastes like vegetable it's Devon if I've learned anything from this competition it's that the kid doesn't always know what they want there's also eggs scrambled eggs and what's kind of vegetable do you like Jake tomatoes which is not much that's not what I expected my mom what is the rainbow tastes like this one I speak oh it's basically what's flavor so the star tastes like eggs and vegetables and the rainbow tastes like ice cream I don't know how to combine two things together Wow beautiful so is there no whoa whoa mmm is it just a simple water actually just water what does it taste like powerful powerful powerful powerful miss it's a sweet is a sour is a I think our sound I was number to do like limo sour like lime when she said Papa full flavor being I have some ideas alright hey what are you doing do you think that we can make you this drawing in a dish oh pretty sure song alright so we're gonna go already gonna keep drawing okay so here's my plan for the base I'm going to use blue and purple sugar so you look like a nice guy for the start I'm going to make star-shaped sandwich with cheddar cheese cucumbers and egg and our cherry tomatoes for that pair of shooting star I'm going to scoot strawberry ice cream on top of it I'm going to use spreaded white chocolate sprinkle some pop rocks for the drink I'm going to use butterfly pea flower tea with lemon juice which changes color for the star I'm gonna do a lemon cookie with a lemon glaze for the shooting part I'm going to make white chocolate brushstrokes with fruity pebbles and glitter and I'm going to make a fairy berry lemonade slushie with some blue on top I'm gonna start by making my dark cookie first I just have my softened butter and I'm gonna put some sugar in there you want to make sure you cream it so that the butter and sugar get like fluffy and texture I'm going to make lemonade from about the fried pea flowers thank you a dilemma there is a chemical reaction and they changes color from blue to purple here in Ray's plan I am immediately worried so I kind of now I'm just boiling the water coming into today I have a little bit of an idea what I'm gonna do but I'm still kind of winging it fairy wing in it I'm also winging it Alex you are yeah that's good to know so narrow and then add in the rest of the ingredients a half a teaspoon of salt some fresh lemon juice some lemon zest lemon zest can get like a little bitter I don't want to add too much cuz she's a kid yeah a little vanilla cookie flour are you nervous for anything this family relaxed so I'm gonna pop my dough in fridge let this hang out and firm up and then we'll move on thing so I see that I lost twice it's nothing to lose and it makes me kind of relaxed and then I start having fun maybe this is the key of the winning I think I'm in a good spot right now because she did ask for egg and she's not making it Reed is giving Linden every single thing that she wants I didn't because a lot of the things don't really go together but that could be why I lose this one I decided to use fruity pebbles to do the rainbow the only thing is that I'm gonna have to separate each color I'm already over this this was the worst idea they see you got the song so for the tale for the shooting star I'm going to spread white chocolate with spatula nice I think like that also could pop rocks right now cuz it's wet so it sticks better it's already popping did you hear that song I love yeah oh yeah this will pass the time simple thing see I'm having fun de sponge oh my gosh I'm making lemonade and I'm going to melt sugar because I just taste it just doesn't taste like it I fully realized that I am putting a lot of work into separating out each of these colors and I'm pretty sure Linden's not even gonna care I did it yeah because thank my favorite godmother as I learned from last competition working with white chocolate is a little bit difficult so I tried to make my life easier by buying candy melts which are essentially white chocolate with the colors already mixed in so you don't really have to worry about the white chocolate seizing up pop this in the microwave ten seconds at a time I made a Hello changing cocktail before but I've never used butter fried food for words so I'm gonna show you it's dingy it's Bluetooth puffle a color-changing drink that is some fairy magic so what I'm gonna try to do in this put a spoonful here and then take this brush that's cool the edible glitter and some powerful I was worried about how the brushstrokes of the white chocolate would turn out but I'm loving how they look it looks exactly what a shooting star rainbow with look look I'm just gonna let it set in room temperature it should set up in about like 15 minutes now I'm gonna move on to my cookie please I'm gonna stop making sandwiches one-component I forgot I'm going to add ice cream because she said ice cream - that's pods I remember she did the ice cream that is another thing that I'm gonna do point ray I'm gonna pop these in the oven to bake at like 350 just until they're a little bit golden on the edges okay now I'm making Omaha YUM so with the glaze you usually add some sort of liquid - powdered sugars so milk or heavy cream but because I'm adding lemon juice it'll do the trick easy peasy lemon squeezy easy peasy lemon literally so I got my cookies out there looking good just like lightly golden on the edges I'm gonna just finish my sandwich cheese I like to pee my oh my gum do you want to describe what QP is you be my Japanese Mayo it's tasteful that's better Wow I think it's msg to be honest with you I heard it's a lie that it's bad for you yeah I knew that and I want Linda to know I did a youth egg so it's gonna be a open-faced song huh I'm gonna start peeling these off I try to be really careful so I don't break them hopefully this works so cool plating my dish I'm so proud it's looking so good and I think she's gonna really like it but now I have to make my drink so I'm a just cooking strawberry ice cream I'm gonna start with ice since I'm making a slushy lemon juice sugar the blueberries it is good a nice cuz the berries give it like a speckled look which is kind of like the pixie dust so it's definitely not blue but whoa oh it looks great we did it yeah well I'm not very sure who's going to win this funny but let's go find out yeah I'm happy how it turned out it's colorful it looked awesome it looks so cool and I have my secret weapon which is my color-changing drink I'm super confident this point I really didn't know what was gonna happen today but I am so proud I didn't give her every flavor she mentioned but it looks spot-on to her picture I am Dhar sandwich both changing killings I cannot see how facial expression but that's the sound I wanted to hear is as rigid and I do so powerful egg on top I suddenly realized I don't know if she had a pop rocks before I hope she likes it strawberry oh wow that came out flying that's the cookie that will is definitely a cookie with every run ended up a buck to top up daddy what's happening but it sounds like she's liking it I don't know when is this developed up look like the wood poot of it you know what I bet Perry's poo glitter so I'll take that one back hey Jason eight all right so Linden which one did you like sound retreat ice cream or a cookie smoothie I finally won you
0,"Those are things we don't want in the United States and one other thing There's people with predatory behavior in every– Excuse me, but you get mad at me But if I could say this, it's not baked into their religion Trump supporters, can I have you over there. My immigrants can I have you in the other light? Sometimes I feel anxious about how the other side views me. Uh, so it's not necessarily about the idea of immigrants, but I'm Muslim and there can be a lot of directed aggression from Trump supporters that I think I felt and other people in my Muslim community have felt and That's why I'm here sitting with you guys. I own a clothing line Magga preneur. This is my clothing line. I'm a political strategist and a political activist and when I leave my house, I am in fear for my life because every day I get death threats So I think we both should be able to freely express ourselves. I love everybody, I'm here for everybody I'll fight for your right for freedom, but I expect for you to fight for mine too because that's why we're in America My name is Shastina, so I absolutely love immigration but I believe that we need to secure our border and it's the same thing of I wouldn't just let anyone in my car or in my house. Alright, disagreers come on in I used to get anxious about How I'm perceived not just by some quote-unquote other side because my identity is very apparent in standing in my truth I think it allows other folks to stand in theirs and to invite people to also learn more about me rather than Be worried about how I'm perceived. I think my group gets represented unfairly in the media. Well I'm a Mexican and I hesitated because when Trump said that things about Mexicans being criminals and all that I I didn't take it personal because I'm not that So I was like that does not represent me like I'll take things yeah, so that's why I hesitated But then I'm like I am not only one Mexican individual who's an immigrant I'm part of all the immigrants no matter. What country You're from We can say the same thing for Trump supporters right I mean Now we have to maybe I wasn't called a racist, but you were called racist well guess what we're both Trump supporters So now we have to band together Could I, could I ask both of you a question and I'd like an honest reaction to this in my mind, It's languaging I'm a writer, and I think if we made a distinction between jihadists and Muslims that would solve a big problem That's plausible and I think a lot of that goes in it's really the realm of how much people really are interested in understanding that kind of diversification and uh, allowing the community that does know that really I don't know take the lead and Initiative and show other people what that's about. I feel threatened by this presidency. When President Trump got elected as president. I was scared even though I had Not a reason to because I'm legal here power becomes scary in hands of a monster power becomes scary in hands of ignorance, and I'm scared about My people and not only like I said the Mexicans all the good, hard-working immigrants. Yeah, I think the election night was when I felt alarmed. I've been a community organizer and an activist for 15 years now right that night It felt like a slap in the face To all of the work that we have always tried to do in terms of humanizing ourselves. My name is Kipasha I think we realize as immigrants how lucky we are to be here, and that's why we want to create a society That's more welcoming for others to be here >>You said it was a slap in the face, and I take offense to that because You're saying you work so hard And yet we work so hard to to Elect a president of the United States that we think will enforce the the laws We'll enforce the United States Constitution and it wasn't to be racist or it wasn't to Boot you out of the country, and it was to enforce the First Amendment It's actually to enforce your freedom of speech. I understand why you're scared That as a white Trump supporter I am scared of this presidency because I have lost my freedom of speech I have lost my freedom of religion I have lost my freedom to wear this shirt in the public just because I have a different political view Now I'm the enemy in my own country I think that that's unfortunate about happened to you But it's almost like you have some semblance of the reality that people of color live with for centuries here And I've never seen that and I've never the first time you felt that right, right But I I'm just gonna let you know that my neighbors are black. I have Muslim neighbors I have I have neighbors of all kinds when we go to the grocery store, and I'm picking out yogurt I'm picking out yogurt this looks like someone just like you, but it doesn't mean that you experience the same thing I think even though we eat the same yogurt but nobody in my County treats people like that it's Just not. I don't think you would be able to say that I've lived in Orange County up until a few months ago If I'm at a mall or if I'm even at the beach right I get a lot of strange stares I even feel like a lot of people after the election came up to me asking me about my positions my religion my identity so what I'm trying to say is like I can actually relate to what you went through because that to be honest is a shred of similarity to what people of color we came here, and then we were born basically sure I Believe in immigration, but I am against illegal immigration My whole thing is assimilation right so like making sure that the culture's match if you know someone in the Middle East who's Gay will be killed right That's a thing and it's horrible if someone with that culture is somehow makes it through vetting and comes here And then sees a gay couple you know kissing or whatever They're gonna Freak out or they're gonna react very differently in a way that you know we're trying to move past or not trying to be held back by so I believe assimilation is Probably one of the most important factors of why we need legal and not illegal immigrations my thing is about money An awful lot of people who came here legally don't want Illegal people being able to come or get free college it costs a hundred and eighteen billion Dollars in welfare benefits, that's a huge Why do I have to pay so that Walmart has cheap workers my name is Ken hunger? I don't have anything against immigrants. It's a political problem. It's not an immigrant problem. I Was an illegal immigrant at one point in my life I am not anymore but ultimately we left a country of war a country where extremism and terrorism was a reality and This is something that was on a daily oppression towards women If we don't have legal immigration And we'll have that here we want you to come and be safe But don't you want that for everyone else? doesn't matter where you're coming from I think it might be a misconstrued and/or a misconception to think that the Illegal immigrants might bring up the crime rates and when we're talking about what happens After immigrants or refugees or illegals or anything coming to the state and how can we help them from here? I think that is the real essential question we have a humanitarian duty to help one another out regardless of if we're Afghan if we're Israeli if we're American we're all humans ultimately it's so fantastic But what about our vets what about our children that are starving? What about our foster homes that are full? What about them? We're not helping them, we're taking in all these refugees if we can't fix our citizens How can we fix others? It's just kind of like if I can't love myself. I can't love another person It should be easier to immigrate into America It should be easier the way time should be shorter, right But I believe that it's so lengthy not because the process is so extreme. I've I mean personally I think it's so lengthy because it's mismanaged. Yeah, I think that Well that too, but I think it's just like there's a way in a process That should be put in place so it's not 15 years. Let's say that they fully cooperate, right Let's say they have everything they have all the documents, and they're ready yeah, I think it should be a lot shorter Do you think make it less bureaucratic yeah basically, okay? I mean I think I would agree with that I just feel like when it comes to Trump you support the individual, but then the bureaucracy the Administration all of that is so painstaking just so inefficient and in all of this it doesn't really compute for me So I think we've been in there a year, right? Yeah, we have so many changes that we want to make so let's talk about a couple of policy things What about the Muslim banner the travel ban the travel ban to me was more about? Obama But it was enacted by Trump. Don't don't get me wrong I agree with the travel ban right and I agree with refugees But that's two separate things to me so what I'm trying to say is that none of these policies that are happening are Not to do with one another they're all Intertwined when we say we support the travel ban, but we also support refugees But we also want to like help them get vaccinations And we also want to do that some islands want to well don't forget We're funding the same bombs that are causing The Yemenis to have to become route there has to be a reason right so so it's so it's all it's all it's all connected Right so, so why are we bombing Yemen personally? I haven't looked into Yemen. I guess I'm missing your point Refugees you support Yes travel, ban this one, ban you support. It's not me. It's not a mother. Yes. I support a travel, ban So we can assess who's coming in. I just think it's important to contextualize like you're saying nothing happens in a vacuum Yeah, right, and I think that if we start to actually connect the dots like I'm encouraging us to do then It'll become a lot more understandable, I mean I don't believe anyway I Would like to answer your question about why we're bombing Yemen We're not palm in Yemen were bombing radical jihadists in Yemen who were killing people That's why we're bombing parts of Yemen Selectively to kill people who are doing terrible terrible things, and there's a tremendous amount of rape happening in England Taking these little girls grooming them because they feel they have the right to do we don't want that here those are things We don't want in the United States and one other thing. There's people with predatory behavior in every excuse me If I could say this and you'll get mad at me But if I could say this it's not baked into their religion There are a hundred and nine passages in the Quran where people are told to kill infidels and in Christians and Jews there's nothing like that in our Bible or in the Bhagavad-gita or in anything Buddha taught or any other religion. I'm aware of in the world until people renounce those values then They scare me I don't think so I haven't renounced any part of my religion in front of you, so I hope that you don't feel threatened by me So I'm not sure what you mean by that And I won't renounce any part of it slam the point that I'm trying to make is that you didn't really answer the question No, he did. He said the reason why we're bombing him on Yemen is to save the people because I'm assuming that in Yemen. We've Managed to keep out people like that guys remember. This is a video of a trumpet immigrants. We're mixing too much the religion Well, I think the race the Taliban yes, yes that you shouldn't question somebody's religion. I am very religious very religious and I'm not putting anything About my religion in here I'm here to talk about me as an immigrant you guys are here to talk about Donald Trump's like supporting him and yes I've learned a lot like you guys are human, too. You have values you Who would have thought you know that we would have found? Common ground and we wouldn't like hit each other right here You know because after the media portraying you guys as bad, or closest terrorist whatever right? I think the media is getting us all in a different light Yeah, I think that we're portraying ourselves in a very different light, too I mean I feel very attacked just now for my religion when I did start to talk about myself as an immigrant You don't say you kept talking about the travel, ban. It's a Muslim, but that has nothing to do with immigration It's not a Muslim But what I'm trying to just say is that no one should have to explain Muslim Christian Jewish none of the above What they are to you, but Muslims? Continuously have to defend. Not only their religion, but their humanity what I love about this country is the Diversity I just when I came here from Mexico I just loved how there was different religions different colors different people like it's amazing It's it's beautiful, and I don't I don't understand how empty of a human you have to be to discriminate someone just because of their looks, it's it's these pre-programmed thoughts in our head from just media as what I believe just blowing things out of proportion just Consistently just the outlook on Minorities or the outlook on people in certain situations is just bad once you humanize someone when you're having a conversation When I and I look past you know whatever these biases that people try to Enact on me right or that I see and I start looking at you as a person I start listening to what you're saying you really realize that it's not that different I mean we just we have different situations we have different information But we're all trying to do the best that we have I think the real interesting aspect that I guess a lot of discrimination is really about is taking this general idea of phenomenon where you can associate my case at least like Muslims Terrorists equal each other and take individuals and group them so easily with that sort of discrimination And I think that's something that we have to work towards in terms of separating ourselves from doing that Thank you.

 to those around you? Well, if you are standing tall beside them,
 you might be smarter! Researchers have already uncovered that tall
 people are often higher earners - which was hypothesized to be linked to self-esteem,
 social dominance, or discrimination against shorter people. However, a 2009 study revealed that taller
 children have higher average cognitive test scores. Or maybe you are the oldest sibling? A study of 250,000 Norwegian military personnel
 found that the first born had an average IQ 2.3 points higher than younger siblings. This wasn’t genetically based, but rather
 the benefits of full parental attention. When you were a baby, were your breast or
 bottle fed? A Brazilian study tracked over 3000 babies
 to the age of 30. Researchers found that breastfeeding duration
 and amount was positively associated with IQ, education and income. Speaking of drinking, alcohol is bad for your
 brain, right? Maybe so, but the intelligent among us are
 more drawn to booze. A study found that intelligent children in
 both the UK and US were more likely to grow up to consume more alcohol. Similarly, a study that assessed the IQ of
 6713 11 year olds and then followed them to age 42 found the same to be true for drug
 use like cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines and magic mushrooms. Why would smart people seek substances that
 could harm them? Known as the Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis,
 it suggests that more intelligent people have evolved novel values and preferences. For example, while the majority of us function
 best during the daytime the novel environment is night time. Therefore the hypothesis predicts that night
 owls are the more intelligent among us, and an analysis of the National Longitudinal Study
 of Adolescent Health confirmed this prediction. If you find this information worrying, you
 are likely...pretty bright. A sample of 126 undergraduate students found
 verbal intelligence was a unique positive predictor of worry and rumination. However, people who didn’t worry scored
 higher on tests of nonverbal intelligence. Like daydreaming? A new study has found that daydreamers may
 be more intelligent, suggesting that people with efficient brains may have too much brain
 capacity to stop their minds from wandering. Lefty? A study of 96 left handed and 96 right handed
 individuals found that lefties scored greater creativity as well as measures of ‘divergent
 thinking’, the ability to generate new ideas from a single principle. You have little control over being a lefty
 or righty, but if you want to take your intelligence into your own hands consider a music lesson. After only 20 days of music training, a study
 found that 90% of the preschool aged children showed improvements in verbal intelligence. While you are at it, quit smoking. Unlike other risky behaviours a study of 20,221
 18 year old males serving in the Israeli army found IQ scores are lower in male smokers
 than nonsmokers. Maybe abstinence is key? A study that assessed 12,000 teens from grade
 7-12 found that high schoolers with a higher IQ are more likely to be a virgin. A separate survey found this extends into
 later years as well. By age 19, 80% of US males and 75% of females
 have lost their virginity and 87% of college undergraduates have lost their virginity. However, when assessing elite colleges this
 number becomes much lower. 56% of Princeton undergraduates have had sex,
 59% at Harvard, and 51% at MIT. Finally, do you find this picture funny? Congratulations, your dark sense of humour
 is positively associated with intelligence regardless of age and gender. It is important to remember correlation doesn't
 equal causation, but it is interesting to investigate the variables related to intellect. So how many categories did you fit into? Let us know in the comments, and tell us if
 it matches up with your experience of smart people that you know. If you want to become smarter than average

 want to misgender anybody. - That's what we're here for. - I'm gonna go with trans female. - I'm offended. (laughing) - I knew it! (classical music) Hi, my name is Tim Rogar, I'm
 a drag queen and a bartender. - I don't, I'm guessing somethin'. - I think I've my work cut out for me. (laughs) - Uh, I identify as male. (laughs) - Okay - A little. Yeah. I don't
 wanna offend anybody, it's really important that we
 respect people's identities; now more than ever. Come on up. Hi. Based on presentation,
 I'm gonna go with male. - You got me right. So what
 was like, the giveaway? - Um, the fact that you're
 in like an oversized sweater some like, simple shoes
 on, they're not heels, they're a kinda more
 masculine shoe and pants. - Spot on. - Sweet. Thank you. - Hi, I'm Sol - Hi Sol. How do you feel about gender? - It can both be incredibly confining and also incredibly freeing. - Um, I think, Sol, I'm gonna guess Nonbinary. - Okay Why? - I think because, you
 seem to have a very open approach to it, and I'm
 gonna keep going back to presentation too, which
 I know isn't everything but personally I depend on presentation to portray my gender, so that's
 why I go back to that a lot - For me, I identify as, um, agender, which falls under the nonbinary umbrella. - See, I don't- I haven't
 heard agender before today. So that's really cool, thank you. Can we hug? Thanks for helping me. - (muttering) queen, get off of me. - We do, from the scene. - From the scene. - But I don't know how you identify. Who are some of your musical inspirations? - Okay, right now?
 Janelle Monáe's new album is ruining my whole entire asshole. (laughter) - All of it. Uh, I'm gonna
 guess nonbinary again. I would naturally when we're
 out, yknow at the club, I'm always like ""Girl!
 Blah blah"" when I see you but I think of (mutters)
 when push comes to shove I think nonbinary. - You got me so right. - Yeah? - Yeah. I guess for me, nonbinary
 means just like divorced from the concept of male and
 female, and sorta of like, things that are
 traditionally male and female are also just things. - What's your name? - Jess. - Jess? Tim. - Nice to meet you. - How's like, your family about gender? - Just, they let me do my thing. - Would you say they know your gender? - Yeah. But sometimes they forget. (laughter) - Your voice is kinda deeper, um Just based on how you kinda
 talked about your family, and saying you guys
 are figuring stuff out, I'm gonna guess that you are male. - Right? Cool - Tell me about that, is that
 an issue with your family? - They kinda like thought it
 was the way they raised me, but - I went through that,
 being gay with my parents. They were like, ""what have we done, we've done something wrong."" I'm like, there's nothing wrong with me (laughter) doesn't matter what you
 did. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. (laughter) - Uh, how old are you? - I'm 22. - 22? Do you feel like
 your gender is often, uh, misassigned by people? - Um, yes. - Like wrong assumption? - Yes. - I'm gonna go with, cis female but like, fluid. - Sure. So you got me right. - Yeah. - Yeah? I mean, you saw it. I'm female but I do have certain traits
 about me that are not female. Which I feel like everyone
 does when it comes down to it. Just because we gravitate
 towards certain things. I don't think it has to do with what we've got going
 on down here, y'know? - Yeah, exactly. Can I ask your orientation? - Yeah, of course. I'm queer. However you want to define that. - I'm gonna go with. I think genderqueer. - Just genderqueer? - I'm gonna leave it at genderqueer. - Okay. - So I got you...? - I think wrong. I mostly just identify as gender non conforming.
 You said genderqueer. That's like, an umbrella
 term, so kinda right. - So you feel like your misgendered often? - Um, yeah. - How do you feel when that happens? - I don't really care. At all. I'm an experience, baby, like (laughter) - Hi - Sophia - Sophia. How old are you? - I'm old. I'm 38. - 38? - Yes - That's not old. And you look 21. Well, if I had to guess
 something, I would guess... This is so hard! Because I don't wanna misgender anybody! (laughter) It's rude! (laughter) - Look, that's what we're here for. - I know, I know. I'm
 gonna go with trans female. - I'm offended (laughter) - I knew it! - You guessed me correct. - I did? Nice. Do you feel
 like you're misgendered? - Um, sometimes, because I do crossfit - Oh yeah. - So they're like, ""Ma'am
 Sir?"" And I'm like ""Yes?"" (laughter) And I'm like ""I will
 break you down, bitch."" (laughter) - Last but not least. - Last but not least. - What do you do, tell me about yourself. Are you in a relationship? - I am. - How do they identify? - But, what does that have to
 do with my gender identity? - God damn it. (laughter) It's a trap. Uh, that's a good point. I'm gonna go with nonbinary
 again; genderfluid. - You got me right. - I did. - Nonbinary. - So has that been a
 struggle for you at all. - Coming from my culture,
 it's pretty gendered. But as far as much it influenced who I am, I think I've been queer, ever
 since I've had consciousness. But I've had a lot of people
 who invalidate my queerness, because they're like
 ""You're not butch enough"", ""You're not, like, dating any girls"" - Like, queers policing
 other queers' queerness is the most counterproductive
 thing you could do. (clapping) Makes my blood boil. That was stressful. - Because I just don't wanna
 hurt anyone's feelings. I have so many close friends
 that struggle with this, on a daily basis. It hurts them
 when they do get misgendered and they're tired of
 having to correct people. So yeah, it's. It was tricky. (clapping)"

 Reviewer: Leonardo Silva I was almost a school shooter. In 1996, Denver, Colorado,
 I was a student in North High. In a moment of pain and anger,
 I almost committed a terrible atrocity. Growing up I'd learned early on there was a strange comfort
 and calmness in darkness. I was always the new kid. My family was violent and aggressive,
 drug-addicted parents. We were moving from place to place,
 went to 30 or 40 different schools, always seemed to be going
 to a new school every other week. You woke up at 4 o'clock
 in the morning by cops, to run across the country to end up
 at a school for a couple of weeks and then have to do it all again
 a couple of days later. I was the perpetual new kid, and since I
 also had such an unstable household, I wasn't helped by the fact that I smelled
 really bad because I never had a shower, or didn't really have any clean clothes. All my clothes were dirty and torn. I liked comic books at a time
 when kids didn't really like people who liked comic books that much. So every time I went to a new school
 I was in a new set of bullies. They'd walk up to me and shoot me
 with a harpoon, like I was a whale, or dump food on my head 
 because they said I was too fat. But the bullying wasn't just at school.
 It happened at home a lot too. I was told that I was worthless
 by just about everybody in my life. When you're told you worthless enough
 you will believe it, then you're going to do everything
 to make everybody else agree with it too. I wrapped that darkness around me
 like a blanket, used it as a shield. It kept the few who agreed with me close,
 but it kept everybody else away. I always had heard in life
 that there was good and bad people. I must be one of the bad people. So I guess I'd have to just do
 what I was supposed to do. So I got really aggressive. At 12 or 13-years-old 
 I got really into heavy metal music, and I was the mosh pit
 when I went to concerts. The abuse just never seemed to stop. I got into cutting around 14 or 15 because I figured that there was all this
 extreme emotion going on in my life I had absolutely no control over. I had to find some way
 to find control over something so I took to cutting myself. I still have the scars to this day. At 15, 16 years old, I ended up homeless. My parents had kicked me out because I didn't want to deal
 with their drunken fighting, so I was living on the streets. I thought I had pushed
 all my other friends away, shoved them all away
 by lying to them or stealing from them, doing everything that my family
 taught me how to react, which was the completely
 wrong way how to react. But I had no idea.
 I was just doing what I was taught. Finally, at 16 years old, I'm sitting
 in my best friend's shed, who I thought I'd already pushed away too
 by stealing from him and lying to him. Lying in this shed
 with the roof wide open, with rain pouring down on me
 into a grungy chair that was covered in cobwebs and dirt
 which hadn't been touched in months. And I'm sitting there with my arm 
 covered in blood, knowing that if I didn't do something
 I was going to kill myself soon. So, I did the only thing
 I could think of to do: I grabbed a phonebook,
 and I called social services. So I went to social services. Sadly, they didn't just bring me in there,
 they also took my mom in there too, who happened to be one of the largest
 sources of my pain growing up. Since she had spent her life
 running from place to place and dealing with social workers
 and police officers, she knew exactly what to say
 to get them to believe that I was making it all up, it was just an act, 
 I was just doing it for attention. Then they sent me home with her. And as they sent me home with her,
 she turned to me and she said: ""Next time, you should do a better job
 and I'll buy you the razor blades."" My heart just got ripped out
 of me at that point. The darkness I'd been staring at
 for so long, I ran headlong into it. I had nothing left to live for. I literally had nothing to lose. And when you have nothing to lose
 you can do anything, and that is a terrifying thought. I had decided that my act
 of doing something was I was going to express
 my extreme anger and rage by getting a gun. I was going to attack either my school
 or a mall food court. It really didn't matter which one. It wasn't about the people,
 it was about the largest amount of damage in the shortest amount of time
 with the least amount of security. Both those places were the right targets. So I wish I had a better story
 about actually getting a gun, but that was actually
 brother-business-like. There were gangbanger kids
 near my school back in the mid '90s when gangs were still a major problem
 in North Denver schools. This kid had seen me, he knew my family
 and he'd sold drugs to them before. He knew that I wasn't really in school,
 I was just always at school. He knew I wasn't a narc
 or anything like that. I didn't know anything but a first name.
 That didn't take more than that. I knew they had access to guns,
 they talked about it all the time. I said: ""Hey, can you get me a gun?""
 ""Sure, get me an ounce."" ""All right, give me three days."" That was it. I was waiting to get myself a gun
 so I could kill a lot of people. But thankfully
 I wasn't alone in that darkness. That best friend who had saved me
 when I was sleeping in the shed, he saw this place that I was in. Even though I had stolen
 from him and lied to him and taken his belongings 
 and ruined it all, he didn't care, he still brought me in
 and showed me acts of kindness. Just simple acts. It wasn't the kind of overbearing
 kindness where they say: ""Is there anything I can do for you? can I do something to make you better? How can I help you?"" It was just sitting down next to me. ""Hey, would you like a meal?
 Let's watch a movie."" He treated it like it was a Tuesday.
 He treated me like I was a person. When someone treats you like a person
 when you don't even feel like a human, it'll change your entire world,
 and it did to me. He stopped me with his acts of kindness
 from committing that atrocity that day. If you see someone who's in that spot
 that needs that love, give it to them. Love the ones you feel
 deserve it the least because they need it the most. It'll help you just as much
 as it helps them. We're in a really dangerous spot now
 with this trend of arming the teachers, looking out for the kids who might
 be a threat in schools, and maybe turning them in to the FBI. What's that going to do to a kid who's
 in the position I was 25 years ago? Who's alone, and depressed, and abused, and is just sitting there hurting, and someone thinks that they're a threat? He gets turned in to the FBI, and one month of pain
 turns into a lifetime of legal trouble because one person thought
 he was going to be a problem. Instead of looking at that kid
 like he's a threat, look at him like he might be a friend, like you might be able
 to bring him into the fold. Show him that it's just a Tuesday.
 Show him that he is worth it. Show him that he can exist in this pain
 even though it's intense, that at the end of it, there is a light
 at the end of the tunnel. I found my light. Now I'm a happy family man.
 I am a father of four. My wife and my daughter
 are in the audience today. (Applause) And even bigger than that, the friend who saved my life,
 he's in the audience today too. Because friendship
 doesn't ever really die. (Applause) We have to give love to the people
 who we think deserve the least. Thank you. (Applause)"
0,I found out she had passed away early Sunday morning I got a knock on the door and there was two sheriffs and a guy in plainclothes and it didn't even cross my mind that that's what they were here for it and they came in and you know can you sit down I said sure what's going on and as soon as he said we got a phone call from a detective in Florida I knew and I lost it it's the most horrible feeling you'll ever have and I don't think that I can ever be hurt like that again when Michelle Curran learned that her daughter michaiah had died from an overdose of the opioid car fentanyl this past summer her two grandsons Layne and Reid were still asleep in a room down the hall she and her husband Chuck had been caring for the boys while their mother bounced in and out of rehab it was supposed to be temporary but Michaela's death turned it into a permanent arrangement from that moment on the simple act of waking the boys in the morning would take on new meaning Michelle would have to do it not just as grandma but his mom the natural space that usually exists between a grandparent and her grandchildren is gone it's hard to explain it really is because it's so devastating and I don't think I'll ever be the same I know I won't be and it's all at one time so I have this brand-new responsibility not only do I have to bury my daughter but now I have to explain to the boys why mommy's not coming back and I have to take on that responsibility of now I am mom for 47 year-old Michelle and Chuck who is 63 it's back to making lunches remembering playdates taking care of school assignments taking care of everything I mean I'm still grandma to them but now I really am taking on the role of mom and it's not fair it's not fair to those boys Blaine is 7 he's a high-energy boisterous kid with an insatiable need for hugs and kisses lots of Reid is 2 years younger he's quiet and laid-back his grandmother describes him as a little old man trapped in a five-year olds body they are among the thousands of children who have been affected by the widespread abuse of opioids that has pushed us overdose rates to all-time high traumatized by the mayhem of growing up with addicted parents watching their mothers and fathers used drugs and OD these children are often living in conditions which when described are painful to hear there was not one stitch of food in that apartment nothing piles of trash trash littered all over the floor there was like these milk jugs and they were filled with vomit in Vermont the number of children entering the custody of the child protection system grew by 40% between 2013 and 2016 in West Virginia the number of children in foster care grew by 24% between 2012 and 2016 and here in Ohio opioids are the main cause of a nineteen percent increase and the number of kids placed with relatives or foster homes since 2010 Ben is so imposed upon Don him to be in a good mood he is always up and bubbly he just he makes everybody laugh Stephanie Horton and her husband Doug first met Ben when they became his foster parents in 2009 he was a newborn going through painful withdrawal symptoms both of his biological parents had abused heroin and Ben was born addicted to the drug his mother dropped out of the picture early on but his father david mcintosh got clean and regained custody of Ben when he was 20 months old Stephanie stayed connected helping out with babysitting but it wasn't long before David relapsed then began sharing alarming stories of life at home with the man he called his other daddy so he would go and tell his preschool teacher that his other daddy was what tie a rubber band around his arm and use a spoon and then he would be asleep is what he would say he would get really really sleepy and he would say and I would try and wake up my other dad but I couldn't wake him up and he just wanted you know he would say things like I just wanted to be stronger I want bigger muscles so when I shake him he'll wake up at home Ben's dad would often sit him down to watch horror movies the scenes would leave been so terrified and transfixed that he wouldn't bother his father while he was using drugs it was 18 months before the Horton's were able to regain custody they officially adopted Ben last year and are raising him along with their three biological children this past spring Ben's birth father died of an overdose of fentanyl and morphine that's me matter daddy he not a comic book died still got out here my daddy gave it this 4x6 photo album filled with pictures from his last supervised visit with David his all been has to remember him his mother Stephanie says she can already see some of Ben's memories with him starting to fade but the trauma of those last month's with his father the effects of watching him the throes of addiction will be long-lasting Ben suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder bouts of mania and aggression without medication he has trouble sleeping through the night and his early exposure to horror films has made it hard for him to tell the difference between fiction and reality the experiences have all blended together at times Ben can become so obsessive about his interests from superheroes to Harry Potter that he a lien eats other children everything that he wants to do is big everything is very intense whenever he makes a birthday wish whenever he has any type of wish or anything that he does like that it's always to be strong to have muscles because that was the experience that he had was when people are laying down they might not get up so I need to have bigger muscles and I need to be stronger this is Avengers chocolate milk thighs all vendor chocolate milk but it's just wait your chocolate milk means now I understand it's just later chocolate now and I used to think if I drink this 100 times loud turn in the supergirl but now I don't need that Ben's history the trauma inflicted on him at a young age will haunt him for years the way that he looks at and sees the world is affected because of that and that is mom as his mom has always immediately caused anger in me in frustration and resentment of he everything I see him struggle with thank you who knows what'll happen down the road that I always have that fear in the back of my mind or one of the bullies going to become you know addicted to something and I have to cross that bridge unfortunately back in pataskala both lane and reeds seem to be adjusting they've gotten a counseling undone well still with the holidays they're first without their mother it's hard so as a way to remember her the boys turned sand dollars which michaiah loved into ornaments for the tree cuz I was making sure so I could do oh yeah from Michelle and Chuck the goal is simple take things day by day and soak up every minute even though at times it's in the sweetest moments that they realized their biggest fears now crawl up in the chair with me and so with me they do that all the time we've kind outgrown that oversized chair so we're gonna have to look for something like a loveseat or something like that we're all three of us can fit in there but now I've always believed that the critical time for children is in their adolescence through their early teenage years where they were the most vulnerable I guess two things that happen my biggest fear is is I'll pass away before I can get them through that stage life we welcomed our elf by choosing the name Fred Michele and Chuck have just one last bit of paperwork to submit before the boys will be formally adopted a new family unit so we'll keep this as long as we can yeah and we'll have to transfer it to you boys when you get older okay and you have your own families you
0,"In the year 1901, a woman called Auguste was taken
 to a medical asylum in Frankfurt. Auguste was delusional and couldn't remember
 even the most basic details of her life. Her doctor was called Alois. Alois didn't know how to help Auguste, but he watched over her until,
 sadly, she passed away in 1906. After she died, Alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques
 and tangles in Auguste's brain -- the likes of which he'd never seen before. Now here's the even more striking thing. If Auguste had instead been alive today, we could offer her no more help
 than Alois was able to 114 years ago. Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer. And Auguste Deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with
 what we now call Alzheimer's disease. Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly. We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines
 to protect us from infections, many treatments for cancer,
 antiretrovirals for HIV, statins for heart disease and much more. But we've made essentially no progress
 at all in treating Alzheimer's disease. I'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find
 a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade. So I think about this all the time. Alzheimer's now affects
 40 million people worldwide. But by 2050, it will affect
 150 million people -- which, by the way,
 will include many of you. If you're hoping
 to live to be 85 or older, your chance of getting Alzheimer's
 will be almost one in two. In other words, odds are
 you'll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer's or helping to look after a friend
 or loved one with Alzheimer's. Already in the United States alone, Alzheimer's care costs
 200 billion dollars every year. One out of every five
 Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's. It is today the most expensive disease, and costs are projected
 to increase fivefold by 2050, as the baby boomer generation ages. It may surprise you that, put simply, Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical
 and social challenges of our generation. But we've done relatively
 little to address it. Today, of the top 10
 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one
 we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down. We understand less about the science
 of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time
 and money into researching it. The US government
 spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer's despite the fact
 that Alzheimer's costs us more and causes a similar number
 of deaths each year as cancer. The lack of resources
 stems from a more fundamental cause: a lack of awareness. Because here's what few people know
 but everyone should: Alzheimer's is a disease,
 and we can cure it. For most of the past 114 years, everyone, including scientists, mistakenly
 confused Alzheimer's with aging. We thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable
 part of getting old. But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared
 to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage
 caused by this disease. As well as triggering severe loss
 of memory and mental abilities, the damage to the brain
 caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy
 and is always fatal. Remember Dr. Alzheimer
 found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain a century ago. For almost a century,
 we didn't know much about these. Today we know they're made
 from protein molecules. You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds
 into an elaborate piece of origami. There are spots
 on the paper that are sticky. And when it folds correctly,
 these sticky bits end up on the inside. But sometimes things go wrong,
 and some sticky bits are on the outside. This causes the protein molecules
 to stick to each other, forming clumps that eventually become
 large plaques and tangles. That's what we see
 in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. We've spent the past 10 years
 at the University of Cambridge trying to understand
 how this malfunction works. There are many steps, and identifying
 which step to try to block is complex -- like defusing a bomb. Cutting one wire might do nothing. Cutting others might
 make the bomb explore. We have to find the right step to block, and then create a drug that does it. Until recently, we for the most part have been cutting wires
 and hoping for the best. But now we've got together
 a diverse group of people -- medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists,
 physicists, engineers and mathematicians. And together, we've managed
 to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs
 which would specifically block this step and stop the disease. Now let me show you
 some of our latest results. No one outside of our lab
 has seen these yet. Let's look at some videos of what happened
 when we tested these new drugs in worms. So these are healthy worms, and you can see
 they're moving around normally. These worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules
 sticking together inside them -- like humans with Alzheimer's. And you can see they're clearly sick. But if we give our new drugs
 to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they're healthy,
 and they live a normal lifespan. This is just an initial positive result,
 but research like this shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease
 that we can understand and we can cure. After 114 years of waiting, there's finally real hope
 for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years. But to grow that hope,
 to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help. This isn't about scientists like me -- it's about you. We need you to raise awareness
 that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we try, we can beat it. In the case of other diseases, patients and their families
 have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments,
 the pharmaceutical industry, scientists and regulators. That was essential for advancing treatment
 for HIV in the late 1980s. Today, we see that same drive
 to beat cancer. But Alzheimer's patients are often
 unable to speak up for themselves. And their families, the hidden victims,
 caring for their loved ones night and day, are often too worn out
 to go out and advocate for change. So, it really is down to you. Alzheimer's isn't,
 for the most part, a genetic disease. Everyone with a brain is at risk. Today, there are 40 million
 patients like Auguste, who can't create the change
 they need for themselves. Help speak up for them, and help demand a cure. Thank you. (Applause)"
-1,I'm gonna talk a little bit about vaccines today but I actually work on viruses at Stanford the other day I went to a little video game conference night I was playing this game called AI does anybody know the name of this game oh yeah and unfortunately one of my characters who's actually the the speaker who just gave the presentation Katie got measles and I thought that was so funny and I was thinking about all of you guys because today that's not a problem people don't get measles today but back on the Oregon Trail in 1848 that was one of the problems that my characters encountered we have been dealing with vaccinating diseases for more than 200 years and the first vaccine was developed by Edward Jenner for smallpox so dr. Jenner he was trying to figure out why some people got smallpox and why some people didn't and he noticed particularly that milkmaids did not get smallpox he looked a little bit further into this and noticed that they were always being exposed to these cows and the cows were getting a disease called cow pox so because the milkmaids were exposed to a very similar virus cow pox they were then able to be immunized against the smallpox virus so by getting one of these types of viruses their immune system recognized that this kind of thing was bad for it and protected against smallpox some of these vaccines have been developed within your lifetime I know I remember getting chickenpox as a kid I have all of you gotten chickenpox did anybody get the chickenpox vaccine yeah so so I remember I was young and my my older sister and I got chickenpox but my little sister's got the vaccine and they never got chickenpox I will never get chickenpox again because my body knows what it looks like and is able to fight against it but similarly my little sisters won't get chickenpox either because they got the vaccine so their bodies know how to fight against it and prevent it so we get a lot of vaccines as children and then we also get boosters for these diseases as adults so we're talking about those diseases we talk about measles or smallpox or rabies or yellow fever we we know what the diseases look like because we've seen the victims of these diseases but I'm actually going to talk about the pathogens for these diseases which are little tiny microbes that infect cells and cause the body to get these diseases and so there are different ways to protect against or rather to combat these diseases similarly to antibiotics or antivirals but there's another form of defense that we can do before our bodies even encounter any of these viruses or bacteria that can prevent us from ever getting the diseases in the first place and that's vaccinations so there are different types of vaccines one of them is a live attenuated vaccine and that is where scientists will take a virus or bacteria actually change the genetic material of that virus or bacteria this is easier to do with viruses because they have very much fewer genes than bacteria but it's actually a live virus that is made to be not harmful to the body there are some disadvantages of live attenuated vaccines because there's a very small chance and usually not a chance at all that it might revert to a pathogenic virus it's also bad for immunocompromised patients to get these kind of vaccines and also they need to be refrigerated so different countries that might not have access to refrigeration have a harder time to get these there is an inactivated vaccine where a scientist will actually kill let me say this in quotes kill the pathogen by either heating it up or exposing its chemicals or different radiation and these are a lot safer than live attenuated vaccines however they aren't as as strong so usually people need to get boosters against the viruses that use these inactivated vaccines there are subunit vaccines so the part of the virus or the bacteria that is actually pathogenic is usually on the outside of the virus or the bacteria and so scientists can take these antigens and actually just use those as the vaccine so just presenting the antigen to the body will elicit the immune defense there are also toxoid vaccines a lot of times bacteria cause disease because of the toxins that they release so scientists can take these toxins and kind of D toxify them by adding formalin to them also conjugate vaccines are present and those are often bacteria are surrounded by polysaccharides and so young immune systems like infant immune systems don't recognize those polysaccharides as being a problem so they'll scientists will attach the polysaccharide to a known antigen and then use that as a vaccine adjuvants are very important in vaccines adjuvant are usually aluminum salts that are added to the vaccine that trigger a danger to the to the person so in the bloodstream having these adjuvant present along with a smaller amount of the actual vaccine will allow the immune system to know that it needs to make a large response to this antigen so how do vaccines work when a vaccine is entered into the bloodstream it is recognized by an antigen presenting cell the antigen presenting cell or APC takes in the antigen breaks it into little pieces and then presents it on the outside of the cell it kind of just shows it to all the other cells nearby it goes to places in the body like lymph nodes and such where actually beat cells and T cells will accumulate these T cells recognize that the antigens presented and alert other T cells and B cells that there's something bad in the body B cells will recognize either the APC cell or other antigens from the bloodstream and start kind of producing antibodies and a lot of these B cells will become plasma B cells which produce a lot of antibodies and antibodies are specific for the antigen and bind to it either targeting it for degradation or not allowing it to bind to other cells T cells become active and if it's a live attenuated virus that actually has infected a cell a T cell become will be a killer T cell and kill that cell that's infected now these this is very important because the B cells and T cells that have responded to this vaccine will become memory B cells and T cells and so when an actual pathogen is present these memory B cells and T cells will already be available and ready to combat this virus or bacteria so it's instead of having one soldier present to combat the the invader you have an entire army present to combat the invaders so there's some caveats to vaccine development first of all there's a high mutation rate in pathogens our bodies have a DNA dependent RNA polymerase so when we replicate ourselves it's a lot more precise the polymerase can go back and change any mistakes that it made that it makes before going on many viruses have an RNA genome so in this example influenza virus has an RNA genome which does not have this ability to go back and fix any errors that it makes so it's very error-prone another problem is that some of the pathogens don't have known immunity HIV for example there's no there's been no cases of a patient developing an immunity to HIV so since we have for example people can get immune to chicken pox ones I've had chicken pox I'm never going to get it again so I have so we know that there's some sort of immunity that builds up in the patient however without any immunity to HIV we don't have an example of any anyway that that's happened so we don't really know exactly how to make a virus to mimic that immunity so this is just a simple infographic that shows how far we have come more than 200 years since we've been having vaccine development and some illnesses have been completely eradicated like smallpox and some of them most of them are down more than 70% but we still have a long way to go new techniques that are being developed one of which is an actual DNA based vaccine which just presents the DNA the the nucleic acid to the bloodstream one is a virus vector vaccine which allows the DNA of a pathogen to be put into a virus or a bacteria that we already have immunity against are not harmful virus or bacteria we have delivery techniques and I think that there are at least one or two different viruses that I can think of that use a nasal spray like influenza and then also there's a patch technique being developed so instead of a needle in the arm you get a patch with many little needles that delivers the vaccine and that's good for different countries so one last thing that I'm gonna leave you with is how important vaccines are not just for the individual individual but for the community so I get my teeth checked because for me I don't want cavities and that's just what I can do for myself but for the community we get vaccines to protect everyone to protect your little niece that's just born to protect your grandfather who might have an amine compromised system so if we have an unvaccinated group and we introduce a pathogen everybody gets infected if we have many people who are vaccinated and we introduce a pathogen then the many vaccinated people will protect even some of the unvaccinated people if only a few people are vaccinated then there are very few people who are actually protected from the vaccine so in summary we've come a long way in vaccine development and there's even more to do and scientists are currently working on very very many new types of vaccines new vaccine development and we as a community can help each other too and help the scientists and help the world to eradicate some of these diseases so I'm just going to leave you with the suggestion to get your yearly influenza vaccination

 Reviewer: Fatima Zahra El Hafa I'd like for you all
 to transport in time with me. We're going to go back to 1932. So my mother went
 with her family to a house in 1932, and she told me about going up the stairs. I'm taking a little break to the right
 and there was a room there. There were flowers.
 There were people talking. She was little,
 so she's looking up at everybody. And the dearly departed was there,
 laid out on a chair between two boards between, well, he wasn't that big,
 one board, two chairs. How many of you have seen
 something like that? Yes, if you're of a certain age, perhaps. We did have a few hands raised. Fabulous. We've taken death out of the home,
 and when we took death out of the home, we stopped learning about dying
 and what to do about it. And we stopped learning
 how to do something And when we get scared of something,
 very often we stop talking about it. So we have in this country... We don't talk about death
 and dying very often. I'm a death educator
 and a death researcher, and that makes me a little crazy. So we're going to talk
 about death and dying today. I want to start by telling you
 about my mother. My mother opted to go on hospice in 2005 and she and I had
 a lot of frank conversations. I said to her one afternoon, ""Mom, you may have some visitors
 when it's your time to go. You may have angels or family members. I don't know who's going to show up
 but somebody may show up. Will you tell me if somebody comes?"" And she's walking down the hall
 and she looks over shoulder and she said, ""It depends on who it is."" (Laughter) OK, I have no idea what that means. Four months later,
 she was in the hospital bed, in the living room at her house,
 and her eyes were closed and I was watching her track something,
 something underneath her eyelids. I said, ""Mom, what do you see?"" She said, ""Daddy Charlie, grandmother, mother and daddy,
 uncle Claude, aunt Nala."" She has a beautiful smile in her face. I said, ""Where are they?"" ""Walking up the road from the farmhouse."" My brother Jim
 had been gone about 13 years. He had died some 13 years beforehand
 and I expected him to be there. I had had a dream that he was sitting in a chair,
 his legs crossed, reading a book. So I said, ""Mom, where's Jim?"" ""Oh, he's been right here."" The night she died, my mom was reaching up
 towards something I couldn't see, and I didn't know then that
 that was part of deathbed phenomenon until I began my research. And here's some other things I learned. For six centuries, anecdotal accounts and a little bit of research
 have detailed the auditory visual and tactile experiences
 of those nearing death. Most often people are met
 by friends or family members. Their purpose seems to be
 to help the dying person with the death experience. And most often
 these visions are comforting. People see angels. People see religious entities
 that are important to them culturally. So you may see the Buddha,
 or the Virgin Mary, or Yama, the Hindu god of death. People see landscapes. People hear music. Kids have kid-friendly visions. There's a story about a hospice... There was a pediatric hospital
 here in San Antonio in the 80s. And the story went that there was
 a boy there that was dying. He was complaining to the nurse
 about the noise in the corner, the noisy boys in the corner. The nurse looked over,
 and there wasn't anybody. She said, ""Who's there?"" And he named off three names of three kids who had been
 at that hospital before he got there. These experiences happen
 all over the world, all religion, all cultures, all ages. They happen to people who are blind,
 they happen to people who are deaf. Some researchers say, this is
 the limbic system going crazy. These are purely hallucinations. These are embedded memories
 of a lifetime that are coming out. Others say, this is proof
 of the souls' existence after death. Neither side can prove their hypothesis,
 and my conjecture is this: it doesn't matter - sorry
 for all the scientists in the room - it doesn't matter why they happen,
 it matters that they do. In my research, I talked with people who are at the bedside
 when somebody's dying. One wife said to me, she was talking
 to her husband one afternoon and said, ""Do you ever see anybody or hear anybody?"" She said in her estimation,
 he was completely lucid. He had had a little bit
 of pain medication. He was doing a sudoku puzzle, and he said, ""Yeah, there is a soldier that comes and stands by my bed
 at night and keeps me company. Can't you just see him
 standing there at attention? And there's a dog that comes in
 and lays by my feet in the afternoon."" And he went on to describe
 the beloved family pet that had been their's
 early in their marriage. Witnesses in my research talked about
 how they saw something happening and they knew they didn't need
 to do anything about it. So when Mrs Harrison walked in
 and saw Mr Harrison talking to somebody, she was a little perplexed,
 but she asked him about it. He was terrified to die. He had been horribly abused as a child, terrified to die, afraid his family
 was going to come. Instead, on the scene came
 this seven-year-old boy named Jimmy. Mrs Harrison said, she went with it. She said, ""I really didn't know
 what else to do. I just went with it."" And Jimmy stayed with. Mr Harrison
 the last two weeks of his life and kept him company and helped his transition
 being an easier one as he left this world. Witnesses talked about how
 they recognize that the phenomena that were happening were signs
 that death was near, even when experts said
 that wasn't the case. They saw the signs,
 and they knew the difference between hallucinations and visions. So hallucinations, for them,
 didn't have any kind of context, and were frightening,
 anxiety-provoking, versus the visions, which did have a context,
 and brought great comfort. When I work with families
 now, I tell them, ""Your person may see things you can't see, they may reach up to the sky,
 they may look through you, they may talk in metaphors
 about moving or leaving or going, even though they're bed bound,
 they need their shoes, or they need their map,
 or they need their purse, or they need to get to the stadium. They've got to get somewhere. When Mom said – just before
 her three-year-old died, he said, ""Daddy, the train's here.
 I've got to go now."" For that mom and for
 other folks in my research, these visions, these deathbed phenomena,
 were of great comfort to them. When we educate families
 about these experiences, and we educate the patient about
 these experiences, there's less fear. And, my goodness, we need
 less fear around death and dying. I had the opportunity to work
 with a patient named Butch. Butch which was 94,
 he had congestive heart failure, and he decided he needed to go in hospice. He was ready. I got a text one afternoon
 from his daughter that the visions had started
 and everything was okay. His daughter talked about
 how Butch was often in the other room. And this is the language she used for him
 being there, talking with the unseens, versus over here, talking to the daughter
 and the other people who are in the room. And he was often in the other room. So one afternoon - I forgot to say: Butch was a pretty famous rugby player,
 in South Africa in his day. So one afternoon, in the other room,
 the rugby team came to visit Butch. Now his family had also come. His parents had come,
 his brothers and sisters. But there was the rugby team. The rugby team had come in
 on really long ladders. Came down, stayed with him,
 and they had a really big party. And then the rugby team left. 
 They left shorter ladders. And Butch was ticked because
 the ladders were too short and he couldn't get up to where they were. Another day he was ticked off
 because his suitcase was packed and he was ready to go,
 and they left without him. Another day, he held out his hand,
 and he said his daughter, ""I've got these machine parts.
 I don't want to lose them."" This is a very common
 metaphor for the dying. There is some bigger whole picture,
 and their piece is missing, and they've got to make sure it's whole. He's got these parts in his hand. She went and got a Ziploc. Let me tell you why I love that –
 because more often than not, people reach for medication
 to quell something they don't understand. And they miss an opportunity
 to connect with the person. They miss an opportunity to meet
 the dying person where they are. She didn't miss it. Is any of this real? I say ""Yes."" Yes, it's real, because it's real
 to the people that it happens to. I don't know how to measure those things that are beyond our ordinary
 human capacity for understanding. I'm a researcher. I don't know
 how to measure wonder. I know what it feels like. 
 I do know what it feels like. And I know I feel great
 comfort myself when I think, that my mom didn't leave
 this world by herself,– and the boy got to go on that train and Butch had his buddies
 around before he left. When I meet people at parties
 for the first time, think how much fun that is. 
 ""What do you do for a living?"" Me, and the sex girl, and the bacteria guy can all go together to the party. (Laughter) So we I meet them, and this happens. It is, ""That's really nice.
 I'm going to go get a drink."" And I never see them again. (Laughter) ""Let me tell you a story. I've been scared to tell anybody because I didn't want anybody
 to think I was crazy. And I say, ""My goodness.
 I want to hear your story. Please tell me your story."" It's these stories, yours and mine,
 that are going to bring comfort and hope and calm as we help
 the ones we love leave this world, and as it is our own time to go. So if you have had
 a deathbed vision experience, a witness experience
 with somebody you love, would you raise your hand? Ok, I would like for you,
 in the next 48 hours, to tell somebody about that. The more we tell our stories, the more
 we're going to eradicate this fear. And it's really important. Steve Jobs said six words before he died. October 5th, 2011, he died. ""I want to invite you to engage in
 your own sense of wonder as I leave you today,
 minds wide open,"" were Steve Jobs' last words, ""Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow!"" Thank you. (Applause)"
0,what's the address of the emergency um my mom's on the floor and my granddad's face like telling me not waking up both of your parents yes both of your parents are not responsive is that what you're telling me yes okay we will have a medical route with you very shortly uh do you know if they're breathing no no you don't know if they're breathing or they are not breathing yeah so as soon as you do it it's like a big blanket just goes over you everything just feels perfect like your body don't hurt you just feel like a new person you don't think about the negative you don't think about nothing it's just nothing matters if we inspire an ambulance okay how old are you how old are you i don't know is there anybody else there with you no it's just need my mom okay try and talk to her is she awake oh no is she making any noises yes she but she's changing colors she's changing colors yes keep talking to her okay mom mom don't let her fall asleep okay just keep me on the bus all right mom wake up mom america's going through the worst drug crisis in its history and is tearing families apart a generation of children is being neglected abandoned or orphaned by parents addicted to opioids someone i knew introduced me to heroin and then before i knew it it was like it was to where if i didn't have it i felt like i was gonna die heroin is stronger than any human tie it is stronger than any compelling argument it is stronger than a religious belief it is the devil incarnate it is evil it's the black plague it's like the zombie apocalypse it's death it's kind of like you're possessed or something like you don't even care anymore to tell this story we came to chillicothe a town in ohio the state has one of the highest drug overdose rates in the country it seems like almost everyone here knows someone who struggled with drugs amanda howard's addiction started with a prescription to percocet for back pain she later switched to heroin because it was cheaper and easier to get today when you were on heroin and just had brody what was that really like okay like i would waitress all day make my money and instead of going home i would go get my fix then go home and he'd already be in bed so i just wasn't there for him like i didn't give him the extra he needed i didn't spend much time playing with him which he was really really young but i'm the first kid it makes me sad you know every milestone like these two me make because then i'm like man i missed out on so much of him you don't you don't know reality your reality is gone eventually the cycle kills you if you don't get out i'm lucky you know because i seen that wake-up call i got out i know so many people who have died who didn't get that call so i had used i'm just sitting in the passenger seat my husband comes out of the store and i am completely collapsed over he goes to pull me out of the car on purple and like blue like i had od'd he had to do cpr and everything someone had called the emergency squad and i don't really remember you know because i was like gone when you go back to that gas station was your son in your mind yes actually what breaks my heart is he was in the back seat when that happened i was supposed to be protecting him and i died in front of him what would have happened with brody had you not made it out of that gas station that day he wouldn't have a mom and what would my legacy to my son be like how bad would it be to be a kid and someone to say your mom you know died like by overdose and then you're the kid's gonna think my mom must have not loved me 911 um i have two people passed out um like for um i don't know what's going on i think drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for americans under 50. people here liking the truck crisis to a war with police and emts on the front lines in the last few years they've responded to more overdose calls than ever it's like a tsunami is hit but we don't we just keep digging the people that serve you in restaurants the people that work on your car the people who do your landscaping those people are addicts maybe the first time was a choice the second time may have been a choice but after that the demon has possession of them i got something more than 100 000 people have died from drug overdoses in the last two years alone scenes like this are happening in homes across the country and when kids are there you can only imagine how they process it um heroin can affect the cycle of life even before a baby is out of the womb at chillicothe's hospital there's a program for pregnant women who are addicted to opiates the women are given subutex as a synthetic opioid safer for babies but they can still be born addicted to it how common is it here to have a woman who's pregnant and using heroin very common a lot of the women that have been that have come through my group have been heroin users yeah i would say over half of them are heroin users a lot of the girls that i have in this group mothers and fathers also used some of them are still using and you know then society is like really focused on them because you're pregnant but they don't consider that this woman has been using probably since she was 14 years old and she's 24. she's been using for 10 years and now she's pregnant it's all said quit using you know it's it's not that simple most of you guys know that not every baby withdrawals and we're hoping that most the babies won't but the reality is that about 55 to 60 of uh infants whose mother is on this medicine do withdraw so more do withdraw than don't some of the signs can be that they'd be crying a lot they could be shaking they can have a temperature uh you know like when you guys have went through withdrawal your muscles start hurting you know and you'll rub your muscles because they're hurting so bad well you know obviously a baby can't rub their muscles so what babies usually do is they if um a lot of times they'll take their arms and they'll dig them back into the crib like this and then they'll get like a red or a sore spot on their arms or elbows or that yeah or they will take their heels and they will dig their heels down into the cribs and then on the back of their heel right here they'll get like a raw or rub spot i'm just kind of wondering because so i i have kids i have five kids and i know how hard the first few weeks the first few months are of having a baby at home and now it's that and dealing with this and i just wonder so you say you're scared of that kind of what is that like you're going through that i'm nervous like am i going to have energy to get out of bed am i going to be able to get the baby when he's crying like am i going to have the willpower to want to do this makes me really really emotional to think about it why explain that to me like what are you feeling like i feel sick in the morning before i take my medicine i think oh my god i perceive you it's all my fault i od three times off of heroin you od three times in the last year yes and then i go right back out to the same people that sold me the dope that i about died on and go to them and get high again is there a moment that you look back on and you remember that you chose heroin over your kids yeah plenty of times um to where i would lie to my son time i'm on my way i got money for you in there i'm going to be at the dope house so yeah there's been so many times in heaven i got a three-year-old daughter in having her right there beside me in the day pals that's not good like cause she sees what goes on you know you're making a choice where you're choosing heroin over the welfare of your kids what is it internally this that like what's the voice in your mind telling you what are you okay when i'm sick i don't care if i have to go through jesus the devil hell or high water i'm gonna get to that drug and it don't matter if my child's sitting here screaming once um i'm gonna get to that drug and then i'll deal with it as soon as i get it in me and i feel better what do you mean when i'm sick cold chills um you can't stand for your skin to even to touch clothes like if i would take a shower and try to comb my hair my hair would hurt like does that make sense yeah like everything on my body hurt i can sit here and i can admit i chose methamphetamine over my children my flesh and blood and that i believe was the hardest thing i've ever done you know i had to admit to myself that i did that that's right you were used to the meth and the heroine were you addicted to both yes i remember her coming to bother me she wouldn't stop she wanted to know what her aunt brandi was doing i remember fighting with her and her and her brother both screaming i'm not going to use a needle on my knees i'm not going to and needless to say i did because i'm an addict and oh gee after so long i looked well hell this is somebody else to get high with because i was selfish you know i still blame myself for her today and the things that she does it's concerning it's frightening it's sad not only for the people who are addicts who got trapped in that but for their children for their parents for their brothers and sisters for their future the impact on children is way before somebody overdoses it's the lifestyle that they're exposed to they're in a home where the parent may not be able to fix them meals they may wear the same clothes to school every week whether it's they're left alone whether they're they're pawned off on friends or family you might still be in the dryer grandma don't know grandparents who often step in to fill the void tisa bieler took over raising four granddaughters after both of their parents fell into drugs and the kids were placed in foster care i get frustrated using one hand i was scared because i didn't know how to take care of my grandkids in a one-bedroom place and dealing with their temper tantrums and their fits and their screaming i would literally go get in the shower and cry with my clothes on for you know half hour 45 minutes or until somebody would come and calm me down and talk to me you know and the kids didn't deserve that you know they didn't deserve me yelling at them it wasn't their fault you know but everything just happened so fast you know i was just got alone in my life and then i get a phone call and i have to be in town to pick up four girls no home of my own to raise them but i made it there in 15 minutes and i got them and i tried do you feel like you have 14 years of energy in you to parent no i don't believe i've got 14 years of parenting my health isn't good but i know i have to do it and that's what keeps me going do you want me to make you another one yes okay just take me a minute okay because if i don't do it who's going to they're going to go back to foster care or they're going to be living in a home full of druggies and alcoholics and what do they say about the idea of being split up coyote is going to let them go she she'll tell me them are my babies i've taken care of them and i'm like yes you have and i know they're your babies but you're still a child so grandma's here to take care of your babies you know that that would have destroyed her to have lost them three kids at 10 years old looking at it like she's losing her three kids yes yes she does she's been taking care of the girls since she was two years old you know because it was baby after baby after baby and she just took the roll on its mommy when everybody was drunk and stoned so and she's still in her my battles over because she still wants to be mommy and i try to get her to be a child yeah like what would she do when she was being mommy uh the youngest one was in diapers she would diaper her uh bathe her she still sometimes i have to come home and she'll be in there running bath water and try to give her mouths and if i tell them they can't do something she'll tell them they can what does it mean to have a parent absent from their kids lives yeah they missed out on basketball games the little things that you don't get to do twice they're gone why are you dressed like this in this picture what was you doing graduating graduating your kindergarten graduation tell them kindergarten graduate mom and dad didn't get to go to all this and watch her become somebody didn't get to watch this one take her first steps didn't get to see this one graduate from stuff you know yeah daddy did not this last time no so they they're missing a lot they're not getting to see your ball games and your grades on your report cards when you bring home a's the excitement of it all they don't get to see all that mommy watch my game one time twice yeah but i'm just saying you know they're not there all the time to do these things with you grandma's the one that does it with youngs that's true and when they sat and cry you know i have to tell them it's okay because grandma's here grandma's not going nowhere yeah tried to give him some stability and some security to hang on to oh you got her legs up there i tell them all the time life's unfair you've got to make it what it is and what you want it to be and i don't want these kids to think the world knows them because nobody owes anybody nothing you know you make your life what it is living here and nothing's free nothing's fair you just live it and then you die inside the world the way it is today with the kids because kids are they're getting loved from their grandparents and stuff it's not the same as the mother father love it just isn't whenever their parents aren't active in their care there is a hole in their life why did they abandon me why didn't they love me enough to take care of me why didn't they love me enough to stop doing what they were doing why wasn't i worth it that is a recurrent theme their entire life my dad was in the pills and opiates he died of a combination of opiates and prescription drugs so he passed away of accidental drug overdose my mom was into heroin this is my mom and dad on their wedding day about 19 or 20. my dad from the day that he married her to the day that he died looked exactly the same he never changed do you know if they're already using drugs here yeah they were they were yeah i was put into a foster home for a little bit when i was young um i ended up having to go with my grandmother how did you find out when you were a little kid that something wasn't right with your parents well i always figured that it was cigarettes because nobody's gonna tell a six-year-old your parents are on drugs and in sixth grade my mom took me outside and she was like alexis you're in the sixth grade you still believe in santa claus he's not real and i remember just like staring at her and being like what and um she was like he's not real and all the lies my mother had been telling me up until that point kind of fell apart for me santa claus was kind of like a metaphor for like the drugs because it was on that same day where i realized there's something more than the cigarettes it was like a loss of innocence for me do you have much of a relationship with her now not really we we were having a really good relationship for a while when she had just gotten out of prison but then she got back with her old boyfriend and i know that the old boyfriend leads to getting back into her old lifestyle and i didn't want to be a part of it i've gotten used to saying goodbye to my mother as great as your grandma's been does she feel that hole in your heart that's the shape of your mom no no one could if my parents weren't ever on drugs they wouldn't have ever met that's just how far back the drug use goes i mean my parents started out on weed and they ended up heroin and opiates and it's i mean i wouldn't have been born if it wouldn't have been for the choices that were made and sometimes i wish that i hadn't just for the life it might have given my parents what do you mean well if my parents were never on drugs they wouldn't have met and i just wish they weren't on drugs but your own your very existence is tied up in that meeting and collision and drugs and so how do you reconcile that i mean their lives are even more precious than my own i think when a life is taken away from drugs it's just not fair and even though i treasure the life i have i just sometimes thank you i sometimes just wish that it could have been better for them okay okay who's unconscious who's not awake right now as chillicothe and the rest of the nation struggle to contain the opioid epidemic there's no doubt that the next generation is being shaped how old are you the question which will take years to resolve is how how old are you the norm back in the day used to be a mom a dad two dogs two kids now it's maybe a parent maybe a grandmother maybe an uncle maybe a foster home maybe just a whole lot of babies nothing's set in stone nobody really looks at their kid and can say you're gonna have a wonderful wife when you're older you're gonna have kids because they're not sure anymore breathing yeah they're both breathing breathing okay but you're unable to wake them up no i died and they won't wake up okay going really good we got police and paramedics on the way
0,it's morning at marketplace and we've invited these viewers over to put one of their favorite morning rituals to the test a taste test to be exact this is the best time of day to taste anything like most of you this bunch love to start the day with a glass of orange juice I won't say I do have to wine glass at 8:00 but if they're thinking it's all sunshine and vitamins we're about to pop some balloons warning all and spill some juicy secrets in front of each of our tasters six samples of orange juice and one simple question Wish juice tickles their taste buds best rate each one and then at the end decide which one you think is the freshest tasting one sounds fairly straightforward yes helping us out is Conrad edge Beck now the fruit of the vine is his usual choice but this wine expert says judging juice of any kind isn't all that different what I'm looking for is a sense of life a natural fruit in this case orange I want no aspect of chemistry or artificiality that's what I'm looking for our testers have no labels to read though you will soon and no idea which brand of OJ they're tasting is kind of cheap tasting and a little bit stale it hasn't been squeezed five minutes ago that's for sure like this this might be this might be firm concentrate I don't know so far it's a guessing game but weighing Garan and his daughters are hoping this test will help peel back some answers the Garen family doesn't just love their OJ they guzzle it down to the tune of six cartons a month that's 50 glasses between them their fridge isn't just running it's getting a workout I want the but you don't drink that much OJ without noticing a thing or two that's all that's in it 100% orange juice like the promise of pure and natural juice so he's got one simple question for us so why does the orange juice in the store that I buy taste so different than freshly squeezed good question Wayne the OJ Wayne's asking about are the premium brands such as these most of us believe they're better than frozen concentrate that's OJ where water's been taken out then put back in marketplace Commission's a poll and finds 58% of Canadian OJ fans believe premium brands are more natural than juices made from concentrate and say they're willing to pay more for that difference up to twice as much so how natural is premium OJ I do my good good thing so you're in the number two what do you think of it it's just one of the secrets we're after at our taste test taste sweet is our sampled tongue swirled notes scribbled our group doesn't know it but our six samples break down this way two are from concentrate three not from concentrate at our secret weapon a glass of freshly squeezed it's all orange juice officially at least but our testers say they do taste different from each other it's a smell from like youth right you know mine too why is that we've got a secret expert in the room with the first clue orange juice manufacturers are trying now to imitate the taste of processed orange juice rather than ELISA Hamilton loves oranges she just doesn't like what the juice industry does to them and she should know because she's written a book on it called squeezed what you don't know about orange juice orange juice industry has definitely profited from the idea that this is a simple natural direct product is it orange juice natural you can squeeze it at home and you're getting a natural juice but most of the juices that you're buying in the store are heavily processed and engineered engineered that's not a word the big horse juice makers use this is how juice makers have sold it for decades as if oranges fall off the tree and into your carton there are 16 fresh picked oranges squeezed into each carton of Tropicana pure premium 100% pure 100% natural from Grove to simply orange honestly simple but the truth is really not that simple if the juice makers told you the real deal here's how a commercial might look come join me by the time Oh Jay reaches your table this miracle of nature has become a miracle of manipulation the oranges are plucked from their perch and land on an assembly line where they're sprayed and squeezed in the juice next is here for pasteurization heating up then audit huge tanks where the juice can be stored for months sometimes up to a year the oxygen is taken out so nothing goes bad but one pretty important quality does go most of the orange flavor so how do they put it back in juice makers use something called flavor packs okay hang on zing so you're saying that they they make so much orange juice and store it for so long and then they have people add flavor to it later exactly how I asked for the precise time when the flavor is at it it's added I was actually told we'd have to shoot you if we don't do that so what there's a lot of secrecy around what they do because they don't they don't want this to be perceived as a heavily processed product it's a secret formula for making money in Canada worth almost half a billion dollars in sales Pepsi which makes Tropicana we got almost two thirds of that it's simply orange so how much added flavor are we buying I think that's what whoa that looks good to figure it out associate producer Anu and I are packing up samples getting ready to send them off to a lab how'd I do wait a minute host flavor packs are made up of natural components of orange essence and oils broken-down mixed and matched then rebuilt by chemists flavor packs help juice taste the same year round we're searching for one chemical in particular ethyl butyrate juice makers no North Americans like the smell and equate it to a fresh squeezed orange so they boost flavor with it we want to see for ourselves okay they're both marked among the brands going to the lab some from our taste test Tropicana simply orange and Canadian brand Oasis with pulp not a pop guy myself you know we also make freshly-squeezed for a baseline all right off to grandmother's house it'll add two weeks later we find ethyl butyrate and all our samples now the amount can vary depending on the crop and time of year but the premium juice all have levels higher than freshly squeezed you could see it in the taste testing I could smell immediately which one was fresh because it was probably different than the smell of it was than the others and the same goes for the taste ethyl butyrate is naturally occurring in oranges anyway so what's the problem with adding it later in the process well you're not adding it back in the concentrations that exist in nature so what you're getting back in in these flavor packs is an engineered product back at our taste test we reveal how OJ makers boost flavor the fact is it's made it a very different way they add flavor what do you think of that not a lot of the packages that says made from pure 100% orange juice no sugar added no water at it what is added so we should we should be aware of that at the next table Alex Herbert can't believe what he's hearing or what he's drinking I'm angry I'm angry hey I feel duped that's 100% why it's just I want to know what's in my food and they're telling me oh look it's being picked off a tree but really it's not freshly peed alex is about to become a student on a mission when we come back come on over and try a smell test he's out to educate one squirt at a time that's our shoot that's orange juice and we expose how companies avoid giving you the full story we deserve to know and we're not being told and we're not being told and later who's hungry we serve up the truth about breakfast sandwiches don't skip our breakfast snacks join us on Facebook and Twitter we're revealing juicy secrets about your glass of OJ and marketplace viewer Alex Herbert that's giving us a hint so what's the way Alex we've told him that premium orange juice is heavily processed and that flavor packs are added it's all left a sour taste in his mouth so now alex is ready to reveal the secrets that OJ makers don't want you to know excellent come on over and try a smell test if you have a good nose so hold your wrist and give that a smell what do you think it is to help illustrate the flavor story we put some Tropicana in a perfume bottle and put it alongside real perfume I have the original X and I have the little home that's orange juice sorry what's the reason behind our spray test it's another juicy secret turns out the same company that gives this perfume it smelled also gives this orange juice its taste that's right the flavor packs are fashioned by fragrance companies but Ken are samplers sniff it out maybe like a little tangerine or something like that well this one deathly smells more natural than what have I told you that the company that makes the perfume smell so good makes orange juice tastes so good same company we explained to our sniffers why their juice needs freshening up and flavouring up when our shoes is mass-produced it's pasteurized heated and then stored for months even a year in huge vats so that process strips it of its flavor they add flavor late in the process these are flavor packs that are net natural flavors created by the fragrance companies that's added to the process to make the juice taste like orange juice again Wow as an industrial model I think it's it's obviously impressive but I think in terms of a personal level I find it kind of frightening if I have to think about my fresh-squeezed orange juice or my fresh orange juice in the container I pick up every week do you believe that not anymore I think I want to buy my own oranges and make juice myself yes it should be on a nutrition label perhaps but added flavor is nowhere to be found on any label despite the fact the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has rules saying it should our poll reveals Canadians want the full story ninety-five percent of our shoes fans believe any added ingredient should be included on the carton our expert ELISA Hamilton says OJ makers show us the truth if you love your Tropicana or whatever orange juice it is that you like and you know what you're getting and you know what you're paying for fine but know what you're getting and we deserve to know and we're not being told and we're not being told Alex Herber thinks that's wrong he finds out one way to get the CFIA to act is find a complaint so he does porta concern labeling all right submit and let's see what happens as for the orange juice makers they argue they're just putting natural flavor back in juice that was lost during processing and even though OJ is more science than nature a label doesn't need to reflect that fact meantime a long list of American consumers is forcing their hand suing the big OJ makers for misleading them charging premium prices for a juice that's so processed no lawsuits here but when we ask the companies from our taste test for an on-camera interview they say no some people might feel that they're being misled when they're buying a premium processed orange juice are they being slit if they're thinking that it's fresh-squeezed if they're thinking that this is what they're getting that image yes they're being misled juice makers may be keeping silent but their secrets are out the only thing left to reveal the engineered OJ our tasters like best Oasis so that's the favorite premium but there's no substitute for that role - fresh-squeezed gets top ranking like you get the a surprise twist though many say they'll stick to the process done first please I always thought was orange e'er and that's fine that's good what did you think of the last one six it tasted very much like fresh orange juice but honestly I get that as fresh I just didn't like it as much I think so that the stuff that maybe out of a box you'd prefer them the one right out of the orange honestly I guess I'm just used to the whole marketed flavor of orange juice that it apparently doesn't do it for Wayne Garren's family either even though they now know why premium juice tastes different from freshly squeezed defining out which orange juice was the pure orange juice and I may just start doing that everyone make your freshly squeezed yes maybe it's time to put the squeeze on OJ makers to be simply honest after the break how popular breakfast sandwiches DAC up can you beat our breakfast quiz find out now at cbc.ca slash marketplace a busy morning in downtown Toronto you're on the move in a rush so Cabo breakfast with marketplace on a Toronto streetcar hey everyone we're serving up breakfast at market place what's on the menu a hot trend breakfast sandwiches with every early morning rise you rub the sleep out of your eyes seemed suddenly ads form are everywhere this is turkey yeah turkey sausage good right it's great you two can be the picture of health if you eat the right breakfast we've got turkey sausage bacon everyone who's hungry okay Sashi sure can I have a bacon I love breakfast urges what do you like about a breakfast sandwich um grab and go handy for people who don't have time and that's how they're sold to us what do you like about it it's quick it's easy take it on the go yeah small wonder the industry's hungry to win you over south-of-the-border the first meal of the day is a forty two billion dollar business and growing they look fresh and hot but which ones are a better way to start the day we bite into three popular choices from three of Canada's biggest restaurant chains from Starbucks the sausage and cheddar sandwich on an English muffin we've got McDonald's bacon and egg on a whole grain bagel and Tim Hortons turkey sausage on a biscuit I would love to have this table of sausage okay empting but how much sodium's under that wrapper a bunch of sodium in it almost a thousand milligrams oh my goodness that's not good at all says nutritionist Leslie Beck adults aged 19 to 50 need every day only 1500 milligrams of sodium for health so if you have a breakfast sandwich that's got a thousand milligrams of sodium you've already consumed two two-thirds of your days worth of sodium in one meal the McDonald's option even more sodium and Tim's tops the chart too much of that is linked with a greater risk of high blood pressure stroke kidney stones and maybe even obesity and what do these commuters know about how much fat these handheld breakfasts are serving up at Tim Hortons option 21 grams of fat no I don't want to eat it McDonald's bacon and egg sandwich and Starbucks sausage and cheddar both almost 30 grams of fat and is about half the fat that someone should have in a whole day thank you and how do these brekkie stack up when it comes to counting calories there are more calories in it than in a Big Mac really yep miss MacDonald's bacon and egg on a multigrain bagel like 610 calories Haiti more than a big map I did not know that that is very gross to hear it's supposed to be a breakfast sandwich it's not a good way to start the day as for the more pricey Starbucks option the straight walk to your destination and that leaves our Tim Hortons sandwich made with Turkey turkey is supposed to be like the least fat meat that's what I heard that cookies the best meat is it we hit three drive-throughs to find out I'd like to order a blood sandwich please which one has steerer calories the bacon or the turkey sausage carcass turkey sausage sounds right but the turkey sandwich is a bit bigger so get bacon or turkey on a biscuit and you're actually taking in the same amount of fat and calories they see the word turkey on the menu and they think that's a healthier choice but turkey sausage is not turkey breast it's a so it's gonna have more sodium and also more fat since so many of us still have to eat on the go how can we make better choices if you're looking to save calories opt for an English muffin because they are smaller there's less bread they all have an English muffin auction like the golden arches basic Egg McMuffin the breakfast sandwich that started this craze more than 40 years ago it's got fewer than 300 calories the next thing choose egg whites if you want to cut cholesterol and saturated fat that's definitely a lighter choice Tim Hortons egg white breakfast sandwich just 220 calories and skip the meat that you don't need the meat in the breakfast sandwich you're getting protein but unfortunately it's greasy salt-laden protein how about Starbucks spinach and feta wrap with egg whites also in the under 300 calories Club but spoiler alert its packing a lot of sodium everyone's fed for better or worse so that's a wrap on breakfast sandwiches next week on marketplace will help you hold on to your cash we reveal who's got their hand in your pocket I'm just Barbara Cassidy I can't believe that are you really getting when you're paying for before being hoodwinked into paying something they don't have to pay we'll show how you can fight back very happy with marketplace and very happy with myself for doing something good so you can stash your cash you
0,teachers across the country have been walking out of classrooms demanding better wages and more school funding okay now as teachers in Oklahoma countdown to the last week of school many have decided to walk out again this time for good when I first started teaching it was I I mean I call it the Golden Age of teaching I had such high expectations so I was one of those teachers I wanted to save the world if you skip forward to this last year that I spent in the classroom we virtually have no money to spend whatsoever I mean it's impossible to teach art on a zero dollar budget as a teacher you're pressured all the time to have your kids ready for college or ready for their future career it's really difficult for them to be successful with all the barriers that are being put into place we've been years without proper funding in our state and it shows bathrooms with no doors leaky roof chairs that are falling apart old textbooks it's gotten worse and that you're not just cutting the extra stuff you're starting to cut the critical things that you need to actually function as a school we're expected to do more and more for less larger class sizes class sizes classroom sizes class sizes class size class sizes I don't know of any other position that you're you're expected to take on almost four times the workload with no additional compensation and it makes it quite difficult almost everyone I know has a second job or a second way to bring in income I had a job working at a Sears that worked on the weekends it was two 12-hour days that's 24 hours in the tool department but in after school I would do janitor work on five days a week and I'd do that and the meantime my wife who was also a teacher was working at Bath & Body Works in the mall so we worked together we had five jobs I worked at the loft a bike shop host mates bartender grocery stores you get tired of not having a wife at all that's pretty sad you kind of feel like really undervalued and underappreciated and then we reached this breaking point to me it was the breaking point of this year with the walk out the walk out the walk out with the walk out the walk out started as a grassroots effort the culmination of years of frustration on the part of teachers and in terms of the legislature not funding our schools not respecting our teachers enough to where we haven't had a raise in ten years we get paid monthly and it has gone up less than $300 total in 16 years that's pretty unheard of in any profession we set our demands we wanted a ten thousand dollar teacher raise over three years we wanted a five thousand dollar raise for support staff over three years and we wanted funding restored to our classrooms on a permanent basis not year to year it's all of the teachers in our district we're a part of it in one way or another it was like the super hopeful environment like we were all down there we will all together working for the same thing the atmosphere was good we felt like we had a lot of support the legislature basically laughed in our faces probably the thing that bothered me most about what the legislators had said one representative we talked to when we asked him point blank if he supported public education refused to answer that question when the number one employer in his area was public education that was the most offensive one as the walkout continued it sort of felt like all that hope was just drained away they repealed some of the money that they had passed for education right before the walkout happened and when we got to the last day of the walkout and the Oklahoma Education Association said we were going back to the classroom hearts were just broken it was very heartbreaking to see that I couldn't believe that we were going to walk away not only without getting what we wanted but with even less than we started with I thought that you know with the raise and the money going to education that I could I don't need a lot of extra money I just need you know enough to work one job and I thought that was gonna be my out and I would I would be able to stay I didn't officially decide to resign until after the walkout ultimately I had to make a choice so I need to go I just need to get out feels like it's the end of the road I couldn't do it anymore there's no other way to say it I just I just couldn't do it anymore I'm leaving the classroom because I believe that it's what's best for my family the kind of teaching that I am passionate about is not there anymore feel like I've done the best I can do with what I have to work with and I don't like to settle for average my new job is actually my part-time jobs that offered me a full-time position I will be doing title work bird buying or closing on houses and and I will only have to work one job I'm going to work for an international organization that supports music education I have been offered a job in Abu Dhabi at a private school teaching ninth and tenth grade English in lecture I will be working on oil and gas projects I will have vacation and it's just a normal corporate job next year I will be working as a program manager for a literacy nonprofit I have decided to move into a federal agency that is on the ground helping folks who are in great deal of need what I'll be doing is assembling natural gas compressors I'm working with an insurance company selling life insurance long-term care I am leaving this school year to move to China because I feel more valued as an educator and I'll make three times the money that I make in the state of Oklahoma packing up my classroom telling my kids goodbye explaining to parents that I'm moving on encouraging my fellow co-workers to keep at it as I'm leaving them been very hard I felt really guilty a huge amount of guilts guilt a lot of guilt the guilt that I feel it was really surprisingly heavy I just I feel like crying right now just even talking about it is really hard it's really hard for me to make a decision that feels selfish to leave them when they need me the most every single sign pointed to leave and no sign 20 Tuesday I'm a crier I didn't want to end up looking back thirty years thinking I wish I had made a decision for myself and for my family a long time ago I want better for my own child and I wish the community was more supportive of teachers and to make that happen it shouldn't be a battle between inside of you whether you care about your own family or the families of others every person I've told that I'm leaving they all say the very same thing congratulations that's terrible it's terrible you

 Reviewer: Morton Bast I'll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006. I was a surgical resident at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, taking emergency call. I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot. I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as I pulled the curtain back to see her. And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital. That wasn't being asked. The question that was being asked of me was a different one, which was, did she also need an amputation? Now, looking back on that night, I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer. In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to save her life. The cancer was too advanced. But I was committed to making sure that I could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee. I brought some for her parents. But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her, because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself. So why was it that, just a few nights later, as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation, why did I hold her in such bitter contempt? You see, unlike the woman the night before, this woman had type 2 diabetes. She was fat. And we all know that's from eating too much and not exercising enough, right? I mean, how hard can it be? As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself, if you just tried caring even a little bit, you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you've never met about to amputate your foot. Why did I feel justified in judging her? I'd like to say I don't know. But I actually do. You see, in the hubris of my youth, I thought I had her all figured out. She ate too much. She got unlucky. She got diabetes. Case closed. Ironically, at that time in my life, I was also doing cancer research, immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific, and in that world I was actually taught to question everything, to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards. Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma, I never once questioned the conventional wisdom. I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science. Three years later, I found out how wrong I was. But this time, I was the patient. Despite exercising three or four hours every single day, and following the food pyramid to the letter, I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome. Some of you may have heard of this. I had become insulin-resistant. You can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat, whether we burn it or store it. This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo. Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life. And insulin resistance, as its name suggests, is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job. Once you're insulin-resistant, you're on your way to getting diabetes, which is what happens when your pancreas can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin. Now your blood sugar levels start to rise, and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease, cancer, even Alzheimer's disease, and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier. With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically, adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking. I did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less. I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore. More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance. But most important, I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away: How did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right? If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me, was it possible it was failing someone else? And underlying these questions, I became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance. Now, most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance. Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance, you get people to lose weight, right? You treat the obesity. But what if we have it backwards? What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all? In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem, the tip of a proverbial iceberg? I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out. What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell? I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign, but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils. You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of our cells to partition fuel, as I alluded to a moment ago, taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately. When we become insulin-resistant, the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state. So now, when insulin says to a cell, I want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says, ""No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."" And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells, it's probably the safest place to store it. So for many of us, about 75 million Americans, the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse, getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat. This is a really subtle distinction, but the implication could be profound. Consider the following analogy: Think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table. Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly don't like the discolored look, but we all know the bruise per Se is not the problem. In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma, all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body. Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem, and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises: masking creams, painkillers, you name it, all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables. How much better would we be if we treated the cause -- telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room -- rather than the effect? Getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world. Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins. Cause and effect. So what I'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance. Maybe we should be asking ourselves, is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity, at least in most people? What if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening, an underlying epidemic, the one we ought to be worried about? Let's look at some suggestive facts. We know that 30 million obese Americans in the United States don't have insulin resistance. And by the way, they don't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people. Conversely, we know that six million lean people in the United States are insulin-resistant, and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts. Now I don't know why, but it might be because, in their case, their cells haven't actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy. So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance, and you can be lean and have it, this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what's going on. So what if we're fighting the wrong war, fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance? Even worse, what if blaming the obese means we're blaming the victims? What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong? Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore, let alone the luxury of certainty. I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this, but I'm wide open to others. Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me, is this. If you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant, the answer probably isn't too much food. It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar. Now, we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run, and there's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly. So if you put these physiological processes to work, I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes, but through insulin resistance, you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising. When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago, I did it simply by restricting those things, which admittedly suggests I have a bias based on my personal experience. But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong, and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically. But step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested. I'm betting my career on this. Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem, and I'll go wherever the science takes me. I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don't. I've been humbled enough by all I don't know. For the past year, I've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country, and the best part is, just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals, we've done the same thing. We've recruited a team of scientific rivals, the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what's at the heart of this epidemic. Some think it's too many calories consumed. Others think it's too much dietary fat. Others think it's too many refined grains and starches. But this team of multi-disciplinary, highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things. First, this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer. And two, if we're willing to be wrong, if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer, we can solve this problem. I know it's tempting to want an answer right now, some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription -- eat this, not that — but if we want to get it right, we're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription. Briefly, to address this, our research program is focused around three meta-themes, or questions. First, how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes, and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms? Second, based on these insights, can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that's safe and practical to implement? And finally, once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet, how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception? Just because you know what to do doesn't mean you're always going to do it. Sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier, and believe it or not, that can be studied scientifically. I don't know how this journey is going to end, but this much seems clear to me, at least: We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did. Most of them actually want to do the right thing, but they have to know what that is, and it's got to work. I dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance, because as medical professionals, we've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals: open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas when they don't appear to be working, and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final, but constantly evolving. Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science. If obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness, what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy? Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R. seven years ago. I wish I could speak with that woman again. I'd like to tell her how sorry I am. I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered the best clinical care I could, but as a human being, I let you down. You didn't need my judgment and my contempt. You needed my empathy and compassion, and above all else, you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn't let the system down. Maybe the system, of which I was a part, was letting you down. If you're watching this now, I hope you can forgive me. (Applause)"

0,"we look at one of the most divisive issues in America abortion new laws lumina bortion have been enacted in North Carolina Missouri and of course Texas but sometimes is mines clothes and lines harden and we lose sight of the people on each side of the divide tonight we travel to the last abortion clinic in Mississippi which as we arrived has only 72 hours left before it appears the state will shut it down forever every day people show up outside the last abortion clinic in Mississippi there are babies being killed inside of this pink building certainly what takes place inside is morally wrong there's never a good reason for a baby to die the protestors believe God stands with them and they are determined to be heard we have to believe with the givers to stop but just on the other side of the fence the clinic staff is equally determined to drown them out I could make more noise than they can it's a defiant last stand here at the only clinic where a woman can get a legal abortion in the 48,000 square miles of Mississippi just about everybody believes a state judge will shut down the clinic in the next 72 hours but you won't find any apologies here from the people who run the clinic this bubblegum pink building stands loud and proud at least for now Jackson women's health a happy place inside the clinic the mood today is dark you can imagine our anxiety ever here at the clinic Betty Thompson is the clinic manager we know that you will be safe coming to us through this week because the hearing is not until Thursday the clinic is in violation of a state law that requires their doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital just the latest in the ever-growing list of regulations designed by the state to force the clinic to close with the clock winding down protestors like Cal Zastrow believe they are on the verge of making history let's have Mississippi lead the nation becoming the first state to protect every baby to protect you every mom that's what we're going for that's clinic owner die Anders's it was her idea to paint the clinic pink as a message she's not quitting without a fight but behind the bravado she knows the odds are stacked against her is your clinic in Mississippi going to survive I hope so we're gonna be screaming one way or the other you're gonna fight we have to there's no alternative when did you get this car they're so ugly they're cute Duras invites me to ride with her to the clinic like the protestors she believes God is on her side I know as fervently as they do that what I'm doing is moral and right but if I'm that's between the Lord and I when we arrive about 30 people are marching in silent protest I'm not sure what we would discuss when you think a fertilized egg is more important than a woman this there's no place to go with that there is no shame in this Diane knows only too well how dangerous working in an abortion clinic can be 15 years ago a security guard was killed when her clinic in Alabama was bombed by Eric Rudolph and a nurse was mean it's not a joke that you carry a Taser no it's a joke that you carry me no it's not a joke that you have a gun no it's not a long time ago I made peace that that's the possibility that you die but I couldn't imagine a better cause to die for this is a procedure but finding doctors willing to put their lives on the line is another story the situation is so volatile that doses can't find a single doctor in the state of Mississippi willing to work at her clinic go check in for my flight make sure I can get a seat so she called dr. Willie Parker an OBGYN from Chicago I'm gonna go to Midway dr. Parker was reluctant at first growing up in Alabama in knowing how aggressive people could be when they feel strongly about something I said there's no way I'm going south but after a visit in spite of his own deep evangelical faith dr. Parker felt the women of Mississippi needed him I had no desire to abandon my Christian faith or understanding but I found myself overwhelmed by the compassion I felt for my patients so twice a month Parker braved the journey and the jeers people have said some very obnoxious things like calling me the Negro boorishness and saying that killed my race that kind of thing so that doesn't bother me I've gotten used to that standing in the middle of the crosswalk less easy to shrug off is the threat of physical violence among the protesters clinic workers point out Laurie McMillan who once signed a petition urging jurors to consider the killing of an abortion doctor justifiable homicide doctors who provide abortions have been killed this is true frightened sometimes yes paralyzed by fear No so dr. Parker escorted by security enters the clinic through a back door inside the greetings warm but he has no illusions this might well be his last trip here that these might be from the last hugs that we get to share it makes them special to me but there's little time for reflection there's work to be done you all can have the courage to come make that tough decision to have an abortion come pass all the people who want to criticize and judge you that I wanted to make sure that would be somebody here to meet you you are six weeks and five days based on your art design in the next two days you will perform 30 abortions we can safely and easily remove the pregnancy and counsel more than 50 women is birth control part of the service that you provide here it is so your goal is to not see someone more than once my goal is to see a woman as often as I need to to make sure that every pregnancy is a planned pregnancy and every child's a wanted child so I say how many abortions as many as necessary that's gonna rile a lot of feathers I know but when a woman chooses and decides that she needs an abortion we do there needs to be a safe place for her to have one but that is looking less and less likely with that hearing fast approaching the protesters believe they are on the verge of triumph someday our grandchildren ask us grandpa grandma tell me who was like a I can't believe they used to dehumanize and murder babies in America to quit killing babies let's return to the love of Jesus I have the love of Jesus the murder of preborn children Zastrow was here almost every day two of his four children 19 year old Cory and 17 year old David come with him he spends more time out here than I do many of the people on opposite sides of this fence have known each other for years locked in a very public battle over the most private of decisions Laurie is one of the clinic escorts never stops they're here we're here Tanya's here to beg women to reconsider why they have come actually she's usually never here she's only here because y'all are here Tanya likes the cameras she's kind of a camera you don't intimidate he's on you really really Tonya meanwhile back inside dr. Parker spent most of his day behind these closed doors doing what he too believes is God's work as night falls on the clinic dr. Parker is bracing for bad news you always say that it's always darkest right before the dawn well I hope we're on the dawn of this clinic prevailing coming up RT a stunning turn of events that has the clinic staff in the mood to celebrate and the protesters up in arms come in front of people well we want to Mississippi this spring the last abortion clinic in the state looked as if it was about to be shut down for good we witnessed tensions flare as those who wanted it close and those who wanted it to remain open both claimed that God was on their side it looked as if the last abortion clinic in Mississippi was about to close the week we visited a state judge was poised to shut it down with only hours left to go overnight an injunction from a federal judge keeps it open at least for now Marty I got the news last night I was like yeah we're gonna put the patients first and the dismay of protesters like cows Astro is erupted last row is joined today by Chet Gallagher not a setback for our mission it is a setback for families and babies that are being killed in this place every single day that we delay Gallagher is a former police officer who was fired for refusing to arrest anti-abortion rights protesters 24 years ago we love you he's been protesting full-time ever since sometimes even when there seems to be no one there to listen with tensions running high today police move in and arrest Gallagher for trespassing and disorderly conduct tell me where I can stand I wonder I was later come on commander he's back on the megaphone without his shoelaces and following women as they leave the clinic we're the ones above you these women don't feel bad we met this woman who will call Murray as she was living the clinic I've seen those pictures yeah I did the research on the internet we're not stupid I'm almost 30 years old I'm not dumb I know what a bored it baby looks like Murray told us she was religious herself and understood why the protestors came but that she felt harassed and judged by them as did many of the women we talked to none of whom would appear on camera she doesn't dispute the fact that Christians love but that it didn't feel very loving do you understand why someone could see it that way I understand why some people could feel when they're cutting the head off their baby loving you're right I mean in the words you're using aren't loving little baby boys and girls are taken into that building and when they used the suction machine they're torn apart over the past several decades attitudes on both sides of this fence have solidified as have the stereotypes about who believes what we found it was more complicated than that on both sides while Cal's astro and Czech Gallagher's hardcore approach is what we're used to seeing Barbara Bevers has a different tone and plays a different role in the anti-abortion rights movement this is our nurse's station Bevers runs a crisis pregnancy center providing support for those who opt to have their babies baby clothes she says she worries about the young women so many of them say because it was legal I thought it was right we have sanitized abortion we can't go back to the coat hanger days so we don't call them coat hangers anymore we call him cannulas that cannula does the same thing to the baby that the coat hanger well but it doesn't kill the mother it doesn't kill the mother but it still kills the baby over the years beavers had brought some of the pregnant young women home we joined her today as her grandkids play on the lawn so proud of herself does she understand we asked that many of the women seeking abortions don't have this kind of support their vision they think all there is is right this moment I got a deal with it right I spent some time with Barbara she says you know women will always regret this in some part of themselves my response to that is one of three American women have had them is she saying that all these women are crazy out there that's what these people want to have happen to women because not only do they scream at women when they come into the building but when they come out and you're screaming how's it feel to have killed your baby man that's a bad person that's there's nothing Christian about that you know talking to Diane earlier today she said I don't understand the name-calling when they're coming out that that's just hateful that's evil you agree with her oh I would agree yes and I can't believe they do that I'm trying to deal with that kind of stuff that's terrible we don't her believe assault anyone what I usually say to a mom coming up from abortion there's oh say ma'am can you talk and pray for a minute with soap and water can't wash off your heart there are deeply personal and emotional arguments on both sides think about it if there was somebody throwing a two-year-old off a bridge into the river and the mom is offended because somebody says wait stop Cal Zastrow says he will never stop fighting and neither will dr. Parker it was a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day but it's still cloudy until there's a definitive legal decision we have to realize that this is just one small step forward in a long fight and so the battle continues each side claims a high moral purpose in which there's no room for compromise no benefit to talk the lines are drawn for now the clinic stays open since the federal court intervened in April the clinic has continued to operate though it's future remains uncertain needless to say abortion remains a deeply controversial and emotional issue which has ripped families and communities apart we invite you to go to our website at abcnews.com slash Nightline to share your thoughts"

were trying to prove that there were less stomach incidences with Vioxx versus the placebo and what was happening with the data was that actually there was a four times increased death risk in the Vioxx category two to four times and with many heart attacks and strokes and instead of releasing that part of the data set they released only information about stomach maladies and obviously they didn't get away with that for very long the New York Times found out there was an article on in the New York Times but in between that and the time it was pulled off the market it was about one to two years so the information was even out there in the public and the FDA still hadn't pulled it yet so each group of a new polymer proofs on details to know they would pack will come off the tavius Sakia do she mapped it is to say pass it on woody oppressor so after working for Merck after seeing the corruption from the inside I I left the company because I was very disturbed by how little they seemed to care about people and health and how much they seemed to care all about money and I went to live in Europe after that and I saw how health is done a little bit differently particularly in Holland where I was and I was blessed to have my son over there and I changed my mindset I had already discovered the corruption so I didn't trust the pharmaceutical industry but being American we're raised to believe that the doctors know everything and every time you have a small issue you run to the doctor and I saw a complete opposite of that in Holland and people were far healthier so then when I had my son and I went back to the US and I was pressured by a doctor to vaccinate my son even though he had had no vaccines at that point I said no I'm going to do my research first he said I'm the doctor I've done the research and I said I know where you get your research I used to work for Merck and call on pediatricians so I will do my own research he didn't like that at all left the room and my son is vaccine free today after everything that I learned and it was far worse than even what I saw with Vioxx because children are are literally dying and being harmed and ending up with life long life destroying chronic illness and and things like autism and paralysis and nervous system issues and developmental issues as well as autoimmune and type 1 diabetes things like that and now in the u.s. one in every to one and every other child so half of the childhood population is sick with chronic illness and this is not the case in other developed countries where they vaccinate far less of apologies would be a totally uncommon question even a pappardelle keziah pop effect you might know me zulay la bouche saving power live Eric Giovanna yeah I've been speaking out for two years I got involved when the fight for when murk was pushing a mandatory vaccine law for school in California and it's very similar to the one in France where it will require upwards of 30 vaccine shots so doses before school otherwise the child can't go to school and there's also pressure in terms of the child protective services and in the US as well so I started speaking out then and my life changed very quickly I guess I wasn't when you work in the pharmaceutical industry you know they make it clear that they watch everything you do when you're an employee and they know every move you make and you can imagine they don't play nicely with employees who speak out and they have obviously not been so nice I get well they broke into my house a few times there were a lot of intimidation tactics used they hacked my bank accounts at one of the largest banks in the US they call it the fraud department called me and said we've never seen the kind of hacking attempts that your accounts had been on we are taking all of your accounts offline he actually said I've worked for the fraud department for twenty years and I've never seen anything like it who did you piss off and I said well let me tell you so they're constantly hacking into everything my websites always down always into the PayPal linked in my email my phones they crashed a computer every six months the SKA no no no but yes so there's been there's there's a lot and my life changed that day and but instead of silencing me it made me want to fight even harder because you know you know you're right when they come after you like that I know I'm right anyway but it just it just spurred me to do what I'm doing and I feel like it's my calling in life so I won't stop and I won't be silenced Oh Tod de la Paz Evo uno disco diva consumeristic de Medici Mo Vaughn la misión uh she consulship so a lot of the European countries are relying on data from the United States on vaccines and a lot of the science coming out of the u.s.a is biased a lot of the pharmaceutical companies are in academic research and in the research institutions and they're controlling what is released and how the studies are done and the data that's manipulated but also with vaccines they're not qualified as a pharmaceutical drug or a pharmaceutical treatment as such in by the FDA by the US government they're classified as a biologic so they do not undergo the same level of testing as pharmaceutical drugs they go on undergo far less and when I was at Merck we were always taught that the gold standard for pharmaceutical drug testing was a placebo based blind double-blind placebo based long-term study and vaccines do not have to be subjected to that so there are no placebos in vaccine trials so if you are studying just one vaccine against another vaccine but they both contain the same toxic chemicals and they're causing the same amount of health damage it doesn't mean they're safe because there's just as much health damage in both groups and so without a real placebo you you can't determine safety and the pharmaceutical companies can get away with saying things are safe when they're clearly not because if you actually read the product insert in the vaccine boxes which the doctors never show you it lists all of the health issues that we're seeing throughout the US and throughout the world but in the u.s. more it listed in black and white on the insert that this has been reported right frequently enough to be on the insert as a side effect of the vaccinations positive annuitant a vapor mean on ket federa Justino ontology on suppose it is mo regressive a vaccination system okay cause Polly everywhere K security TC not a roadie my personal opinion on that is that Trump has realized that there is damage including autism from vaccines and he's seen it directly but and well and he had very good intentions with bringing that up and and making that you know exposing that to the public but I think when he got into office things were not quite as he expected and the pressure was probably a lot more intense than he was used to and then he expected and things have gone a bit silent since then and it's very disappointing I not completely surprised the powers that are running the country in the industry are very powerful janeshia debate a vacant controversy on TV TV joj la parte knows the invasion is from auntie very sur la force yo V gamma epidemic is cruising policy so chickenpox is one of the vaccines on the schedule in the US and most children are vaccinated against the chickenpox I most of Europe and most of the rest of the world considers chickenpox very benign and it is in fact you know I had it myself and everyone I know my age had it and you know sometimes we need these childhood diseases to stimulate our immune system and keep it going like gas in a car and we need these exposures to be able to fight bigger things that come along later in life and when you you know there's a place for them but it's a profitable vaccine and when there's money to be made pharmaceutical companies don't prioritize health they prioritize profit so it is a recommended and now a mandated vaccine in California and you know it's it's just it's a great example of how you know there are many populations in the world that aren't vaccinated against it at all and it's not a problem but when you have a product to sell then you create fear around that disease so that you can sell the vaccine and that's exactly what has been happening in the US and now people 20 you know 10 20 years younger than I am fear chicken pox when everybody had it when I was younger and we had chicken pox parties and it was a good thing to get right because it keeps your immune system going it means you're you're healthy it's you know and now they've turned that into fear so that they can sell the vaccine just Kubo so you still do future come secret position today with her but have you that's you pessimist we have lost some battles recently like with in Italy and California but what I see is more and more people waking up every day and pharmaceutical companies and the government's are really cracking down and trying to mandate vaccines because they see this this group of people who is starting to realize that we've all been lied to and that vaccines are not never saved us historically and they don't create immunity and they actually cause health damage which creates pharmaceutical customers so there are a lot of people waking up to this and unfortunately because the pharmaceutical companies have had their plans in place for quite a while I do think it may get a bit darker before it gets lighter but there are more and more and more people waking up every day and more and more people speaking out like you being brave enough to cover the subject and eventually we will reach a tipping point where more people know to question vaccines then just follow blindly and I do believe there will be a change for the better it may take five or ten years and it may get a little harder in the meantime and I hate I hate that because I hate to think of all the children that are suffering but I do believe there is is hope Yamuna River Lisa get the me the Mia that are not on expect evolve work discovery love transmit for conquer set on Twitter but that time inside this poor well we we definitely we have a battle ahead of us and we are losing some of the battles here and there but there is a lot of a lot of small victories and a lot of momentum moving in the right direction and you know as I close my speech today the pharmaceutical companies have a lot of money and they have a lot of power right now but we have the voice of truth and truth cannot be bought and it cannot be covered up for very long and in the end truth is priceless and so we have that on our side so eventually there's no way we cannot win Wendy mercy prostitution si que como epi no Vanessa Torres Antonucci no fifty

0,I'm joyous we've been told that the Sun will give it some light will give us cancer skin cancer yes and you say that's absolutely not true no there is no proof here to that effect in fact yields the opposite that lack of sunshine causes skin cancer you may know that many people have skin cancers in areas that are never even exposed to the Sun strain and so it's not the Sun the the UVB is now you take to taking off the hook it's no longer the culprit there's a brand new study just came out and showed that UVB doesn't cause the cancer it's the UVA now when you use sunscreens and many sunscreens that just block out UVB so you don't tan you basically right you don't burn so that you don't burn your skin skin burning is not a good idea alright in any case you don't want to burn your skin so typically if your body is in the Sun too long it will start burning you would want to get out of it whereas if you put suntan lotion on you don't get that signal and you allow a lot of penetration of UVA now there are some of these other screens you know that are blocking out both UVA and UVB and you think oh no I'm safe right yes but you are becoming vitamin D deficient while being in the Sun and if you are vitamin D vitamin D deficient your cancer risk goes right up okay so again not in cancer any kind of cancer so your your need your vitamin D in order to be cancer-free is 77% of all cancers can be reversed or you're avoided by having a normal vitamin D levels according to a Crichton University study okay so you shouldn't get sunburned you should avoid that but if you're not wearing sunscreen your body will tell you if you're getting too much yes the body will know you once your skin starts reddening that's the time to go out but after regular if you start increasing your sun exposure you know little by little you will have a natural protection on the skin which is called Tanny yes then you can stay out in the Sun near ours i left in cyprus for 15 years so very it's 300 near 30 days sunlight very bright sunlight very warm I could stay out in the Sun all day long and would never have any sunburn or any damage to the skin the best sunscreen is a good tan yes and again the people in the in the countries where they have the highest UV radiation that is the equator you know the person near the equator or the high altitude the Swiss Alpine man near mountains or the German Alps you have your 400% more exposure to UV radiation they don't have any skin cancers in those places none the places that have the most are places like London in England very little sun exposure the northern plains Norway on Denmark Finland Scotland the most and Canada in Canada so the least where people have low vitamin D levels not enough sun exposure during the winter month that's often when they have the outbreaks but we can actually harm our skin by using sunscreens definitely sunscreens are they are composed of sometimes dozens of of chemicals carcinogens that are normally if you put that in the food that's Ava Pro food processing processing company like your healthy choice or whatever would put that in the food they would lose their license and the owners would be my present because it's extremely dangerous to put that in the food but you're allowed to put it on the skin where is it going after an hour you put some more and because it's gone you absorb most of that stuff these chemicals are highly absorbable they enter the bloodstream and whether they go they go to the liver and then the liver has to break them down without overtax is deliver you make what you know you may go into that producing a lot of intrahepatic gall stones and some of them Akuma the tissues in the connective tissues and if they happen to be in the skin area under the skin they saturate there you may develop skin cancer because you took the sunscreens so sunscreens are now a leading cause of skin cancer because people are slathering and rubbing it on their skin and they absorb that stuff and then the other problem that happens they wash off there's dead stuff with soap so there's soap the whole body afterwards to get it off and with it they get rid of all the vitamin D that incident who accidentally may have been created on the skin when you use soap after sunbathing let's say even without sunscreen you know if you just you know make vitamin D make sure you don't use soap to wash your skin except under the arms and in the genital area where the Sun doesn't go anywhere and vitamin D is not me you don't want to wash it off because the the vitamin D stays on your skin for up to 48 hours and gradually is absorbed and that's how you are building it in the body so you don't want to wash it off not right with soap not right away so soap is not necessary anyway I have not used soap except when you have make your hands dirty with oil or something else so you don't want to diminish your skin of the vital bacteria that live there that we side there I keep the skin healthy and nourished and produce certain vitamins actually on the skin so the bacteria are best friends you don't want to kill them off all the time
0,hi secretary Schmitt at the nutritional healing side of Ann Arbor this video is about iodine so I wrote an article on my blog a while ago called the Fountain of Youth or at least the closest we have to it talking about iodine I think it's one of the smartest nutrients like the nutrient itself provides incredible intelligence to humans it also increases physical strength and endurance it's really pretty amazing every single cell in the body needs it especially the thyroid okay so I 10 was discovered in the early 1800s and then in 1820s there's a guy named dr. Louisville who figured out the correct dose per day is 12.5 milligrams is what everybody needs and there's a certain ratio of iodine versus iodide and so when you see a product online called lugo solution hopefully it's correct it's got for example 12.5 milligrams per dose okay it was the first Western medicine so they gave it to people with Gorder their thyroids got bigger and the thyroid is looking for iodine it actually swells up so you give them the pill or the or the liquid iodine for the symptom and that's what Western medicine is you got a symptom pill symptom pill simpleton pill you get what I'm saying as opposed to trying to find the cause so I didn't deficiency though is a cause for a lot of symptoms currently and I think it's pretty well ignored by medicine and but there's urine tests you can do to identify iodine deficiency every cell needs it and it'll detoxify aluminum mercury chlorine bromine bromide fluorine fluoride those are all toxins let's not forget the fluorine and the fluoride okay so when you look at the periodic table of the elements from chemistry and you look all the way to the right the second column from the right is the halides and you got bromine in there you got fluorine and chlorine you got iodine so iodine is the nutrient the other three our tox and they're used as antibiotics so you use those pesticides and they're basically uses poisons so if you don't have enough iodine in your body and you're exposed to flame-retardant that's bromine your body will take in the bromine and use it as if it were iodine why because they're all in the same column in that table and what that means is they all have all those elements have the same number of electrons on the outer shell now we're talking little chemistry here little physics and so the body says oh look there's eight electrons in the outer shell of that fluorine we're going to use it as if it's iodine so that's so when you start taking in the iodine your body says oh that's the real deal let's push out the blue the bromine fluorine bromine chlorine etc and aluminum and mercury so you get some side effects of this of this detoxification and the main side effect I seen in my patients is itchy skin so just picture the thyroids right here and the itching is usually between here and here and as the thyroid is the center of it so I personally over the course of a few months increase my dose from 12 point 5 milligrams of iodine to 56 milligrams every two weeks I increase my dose by 6 milligrams and my main symptom when I started detoxing too fast was I would pull on my ears they were itchy and sort of red other people would itch their scalp one person it's their legs but most the time it's right here right here okay so if you're itching is too much just cut back and give it a few more weeks and then try to increase the dose again now if you talk to anybody there they'll usually say oh you're allergic to iodine no nobody's allergic to iodine you might be allergic to the protein that iodine is attached to so look at the ingredients and see what is it attached to or it could be that you're just detoxifying and most people have some sort of a detox symptom when they take the higher amounts of iodine into their body okay so other symptoms can be like a racing heart I remember one day I was driving down the road and I just was start with just sweating so it increases your metabolism and increases your heat and it's so I cut back on you know for a couple weeks from just from excess sweating another thing is you can get too much energy believe it or not you might be tired because you're iodine deficient so that's why you can only take iodine in the morning and no later than lunchtime so don't take it past 12 noon or 1 o'clock because if you take it at dinnertime it might keep you awake so there there's been three winter winters here in Michigan where I took high doses of iodine every day to stay warm at night and I kept my house really cold and and it was an experiment and it was pretty incredible how I didn't kept me warm but also too I only slept six hours every single night for three winters because I didn't need eight hours and I had good energy all day during the day so if you want more information you can check out dr. David Brownstein he's actually a medical doctor not too far from my office he's about a half hour from my office I called him the modern pioneer in iodine research and he's got books he's got a website just search his name online you'll find it if you like this information please give me a thumbs up and subscribe thanks
0,hello dear friends and cultural creatives Bruce here today's topic is on the nature of vaccinations in the role of our immune system and protecting us from environmental antigens and those kind of elements that try to undermine our lives so this is a very significant discussion because I want to introduce a topic that is not really understood by the conventional public and that is this vaccinations and controlling the immune system to create antibodies against those germs or parasites that try to attack us how do we create vaccines our conventional understanding in the world is that we can create an immune response by taking foreign elements bacteria viruses and parasites or pieces of these elements and putting them into a solution injecting it under our skin and then invoking the immune system to make a response against these invasive foreign materials or antigens the most important issue we have to face is this very serious issue about vaccines because we believe that the vaccines are the way to program the immune system to protect us from environmental parasites of bacteria and viruses and therefore we have bought into the system of artificially putting these antigens under our skin to invoke an immune response the question of whether this is beneficial or not is now coming to the front because we're finding a very very epidemic increase in regard to allergic reactions or hypersensitivity we're also finding that people are bringing in the concept that autism is seems to be associated with the widespread use of vaccines so there are very profound questions out there as to the safety of using vaccines to create immune responses in the world in which we live well I'd like to address this issue from the point of view of immunology has made a misunderstanding about something very important called the tonsils we have all heard of tonsils and many of us have had our tonsils taken out and I said well what are the tonsils well if you look in a conventional book council represents an immune mechanism that will protect us from invasive organisms and the tonsils there's actually three pairs or six tonsils making a ring around your throat and the significance of the tonsils and they are the devices that apparently are protecting us and I use that with quotes from foreign things such as viruses or bacteria that enter through our mouth our nose our eyes or our ears because all of these structures have conduits that connect to the throat so if an invasive organism enters into our body through any of the holes in our head these organisms must pass through the ring of the tonsils it was believed and still believed by many that these tonsils represent the first line of defense to protect us against these invasive organisms it's time to reconsider this concept completely for this reason when we say that tonsils are there for our defense and you would think well tonsils are there to protect us for that from anything that gets on the inside and the significance is this tonsils actually invite antigens into the body and all of a sudden what do you mean invite them I thought they were supposed to protect me well all the tonsils have little tiny slivers of connection to the surface so that we eat something or something goes down our throat a small sample of what we just swallowed goes down these little crevices and enter into the tonsils the function of the tonsils is then to read the nature of these things that we brought into our mouth and then identify them by creating antibodies that will complement with these foreign things introduced into the body you

 Reviewer: Tanya Cushman What if I told you that breakfast
 being the most important meal of the day was wrong? (Laughter) What if I told you it is more important
 when you eat than what you eat? Perhaps much of the nutritional dogma
 that we've been raised with is now outdated, like snacking all day long
 and eating many meals. Over the next few minutes,
 I plan to discuss with you what I believe to be the most profoundly
 transformational concept and strategy as it pertains to health and aging. Over the last 20 years, as a nurse practitioner
 and a functional nutritionist, I've seen tremendous shifts, tremendous shifts in health and wellness: escalating rates of obesity, diabetes
 and cardiovascular disease - many of which are preventable. The choices we make in terms of nutrition
 are profoundly impactful on our health, more than most of us realize. During my training as a nurse practitioner many years ago, the dominant nutritional paradigm
 was exercise more, eat less. I've found this
 to be profoundly ineffective for most, if not all,
 of my female patients. The concept of ""calories-in,
 calories-out"" alone is just not effective. Many of the things that I work with,
 with my female patients really focus on the connection
 between our lifestyle choices and how that impacts healthy aging and weight gain. I do not believe, nor do I support,
 the limiting belief that women have to accept weight gain
 as a normal function of aging. The National Health
 and Nutrition Exam Survey, which looks at data
 with regard to children and adults in terms of their nutrition
 and escalating obesity rates, compares what went on in the 1970s, where most Americans
 consumed three meals a day and no snacks; fast forward to today, most of what we are doing as Americans
 is eating three meals a day and snacking all day long. Really. And so one of the things
 that starts to happen when healthcare providers
 are telling our patients that we need to eat all day long - it's wrong. Eating all day long overtaxes
 our pancreas and our digestive system. It overtaxes it so much
 that it cannot work properly. And if it cannot work properly,
 we cannot absorb our food or the nutrients in that food. Another really important distinction
 when it comes to meal frequency, or how frequently we're eating, is the debate over sugar burners
 versus fat burners. And when we're talking about that, a sugar burner is someone
 that consumes lots of carbohydrates and taps into glucose
 as their primary fuel source, which is incredibly inefficient. If you recognize these individuals: They are frequently hungry. They often get hangry. They have - yes - significant dips
 in their energy level. They struggle more with fat loss,
 and they struggle more with their weight because insulin levels are high. Insulin is that fat-storing hormone. So if levels remain high,
 we have more oxidative stress; we have more inflammation; and we struggle more with weight gain. In sharp contrast to this are fat burners. They tap into fat stores for energy; they have sustained energy; they are much more clear cognitively; they don't get hangry; it's easier for them to lose weight because they tap into those fat stores; they sleep better;
 and they age more slowly. So meal timing and how frequently
 we are eating - it's absolutely crucial. Absolutely crucial. Let's talk about some statistics
 as they pertain to women and healthy aging. So we know two-thirds of women
 40-50 years of age are overweight, and more than half are obese. How do we proactively
 address this statistic without quick fixes? It makes me want to cry when my female patients
 would prefer I write them a prescription than work on changing their diet, more exercise, other lifestyle changes. Women in their 50s and 60s
 gain an average of 1.5 pounds per year. Per year. That's average. And some of this is attributable
 to things like hormonal fluctuations, women having less lean muscle mass
 than their male counterparts, sleep disturbances and mood disorders. However, there are strategies
 we can use to help offset this. So folks, I want you to save your money on potions and powders and supplements
 that are not long-term solutions. I've got a better idea. And I'm going to tell you about it. I've got a better idea. There are lots of strategies
 that I use with my female patients, but none more powerful
 than intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting
 can help fuel fat loss as well as many other benefits
 that I'll talk more about in a second. But it also can improve
 interpersonal relationships and self-esteem. And for many women, this permits them - it's the magic bullet that allows them
 to gain back their former selves. Really powerful. And the really cool thing
 about intermittent fasting is it's free, it's flexible and it's simple. You take nothing else away. Free. Flexible. Simple. So let's talk about intermittent fasting. It is the absence of food
 during a prescribed time period. You exist either in a fed
 or a fasted state. I'm sure for many of you,
 you had breakfast this morning. So when you eat, insulin
 is secreted by the pancreas to move sugar into the cells. We store the bulk of our sugar
 in our liver and our skeletal muscle. But when we exceed those storage sites, we store it as fat. When we're fasted, insulin levels are low and we can tap into fat stores for energy. Free. Flexible. Simple. And so, when we're talking about
 intermittent fasting, it's fairly simple. If you skip breakfast - If you skip breakfast in the morning, you can reduce your caloric intake
 by 20 to 40 percent. And the typical time frame
 that I recommend to my female patients is a 16:8. Sixteen hours a day fasted
 with an eight-hour feeding window. I know that seems
 a little overwhelming at first, but I'll give you some strategies
 for how you go about doing that. So, the 20-40 percent
 reduction in calories means that you can fuel fat loss. So what are some of the benefits
 other than fat loss - fat loss and especially visceral fat
 around our abdomens, around our major organs? We know that it improves mental clarity
 because insulin levels are low. We know that it spikes
 human growth hormone, which helps us with lean muscle mass. We know that it induces
 something called autophagy - I will speak more about this in a second. But this is spring cleaning for the cells. It is only evoked when we are fasted. Autophagy. We know that it lowers insulin levels, blood pressure, improves our cholesterol profile. And we know that it can reduce your risk
 for developing cancer and Alzheimer's disease,
 which I like to call type 3 diabetes. If, for no other reason,
 we want to protect our brains. As wonderful a strategy as this is,
 it is not for everyone. I'm going to talk briefly about the individuals
 that want to avoid this strategy. First and foremost,
 if you are a brittle diabetic, or you have difficult-to-control diabetes; if you are a child, an adolescent
 or age greater than 70 - might not be the best strategy; if you are pregnant; if you have chronic heart issues,
 kidney or renal issues - not the best strategy. If you have a history
 of a disordered relationship with food, whether it is anorexia,
 bulimia or binge eating - might not be the best strategy
 because it can invoke those tendencies. And last but not least,
 if you have a low body mass index, you're frail or you've recently been in the hospital
 like I was for 13 days. I'm not currently intermittent fasting. Now, everyone always asks, Well, when you're fasting,
 we know we're not eating food, but you can absolutely consume things
 like filtered water, plain coffee or tea. They will not break your fast. But when you're ready to eat,
 what do you eat? Now, I would be remiss
 if I did not mention that there are foods that are going to be more
 advantageous for you to consume when you're ready to break your fast. So I want you to focus
 on real whole foods. That's what your body needs,
 wants and deserves. So I want you to purchase the best quality
 protein that your budget permits. Ideally, organic or pastured meat,
 wild-caught fish. Healthy fats - so crucial - helpful for building healthy hormones and also really important for satiety -
 making sure our taste buds light up, make us happy. I'm not part of the anti-fat brigade. Really, really important. Twenty years ago, I might
 have told you not to eat fat, but now we know better. So I want you to focus
 on things like avocados, coconut oil, grass-fed butter and nuts -
 really great, healthy fats. Unprocessed carbohydrates. Ladies, absolutely crucial, if you're in perimenopause,
 the five to seven years before menopause, or you're in menopause, quality and quantity are crucial. So I want you to consume things
 like low-glycemic berries, green leafy vegetables, squash,
 quinoa, sweet potatoes as opposed to bread and pasta. Cautionary tale: I want you
 to limit sugar and alcohol. By that I mean, I want you
 to not consume those things because they can offset
 all the good that you're doing. And lastly, keep yourself well hydrated. Now, I want to make sure that I briefly touch on
 some of the practical implications for how you would go about
 starting intermittent fasting. Generally, I have my ladies
 start with 12-13 hours of fasted period. And they can slowly increase
 by an hour or so every day until they've reached that 16 hour mark. Again, you want to keep yourself
 really well hydrated. You can also have plain coffee or tea. In addition to that, you want to ensure
 that you give it a solid 30 days before you determine
 if it's the right strategy for you. And if you have chronic health conditions, I want to make sure you discuss it
 with your healthcare provider. Really important. And recognize it may take
 six to eight weeks to really see the full benefits
 of what you're doing. The biggest pain point
 for my female patients is weight gain. I have a fantastic strategy
 to help with this, but I don't want you to buy into
 the next $50 container of protein powder or the hottest weight loss
 supplement that's out there. I want you to think about the fact
 this is a simple, flexible and free option that you can try at home, discuss with your healthcare
 provider if necessary. I really feel so passionately about this because it's something that all of us
 should be discussing with our patients. Thank you. (Applause)"

0,"ONLY in JAPAN So you want to live a long life perhaps past a hundred years old. Japan may have some of the answers Welcome to Sugamo in central Tokyo. This place is nicknamed the grandma Harajuku. It's a place where seniors come for high-fashion. Sugamo may be in Tokyo, but it's certainly not like neighboring Shibuya or Harajuku. It retains a lot of the charms of the Showa era The area may have stayed the same, but most of the residents have gotten older and that's reflected in what they sell along the main shopping street. And, this Sugamo neighborhood is a great jumping-off point to ask the question: Why do Japanese live so long? Japan is famous for having the longest life expectancy in the world, in fact. right now,  there are two million people over the age of 90 living here in Japan. That's about 2% of the population - which is crazy! So, there's got to be a secret to why people live so long. Some say, it's because everyone drinks green tea daily. It's served everywhere and the most popular item in drink vending machines... is green tea. Japanese eat smaller portions of food More seafood and lean meats It could be the fermented foods they eat, which are healthy for both the heart and the stomach Japan is also a bath culture. Showers are nice, but soaking in a bath relieves stress and improves the body's circulation Natural Hot Springs are everywhere, loaded with minerals good for the skin Access to affordable and top-notch health care? That could be a reason, too Kids learn personal responsibility in school. Most walk or bicycle there. Could that be the setup for a long life? Violence and gun-related deaths are almost non-existent in Japan Japan has a holiday called ""Respect for the Aged Day. And, in Japan, senior citizens are ""Living Treasure"" The government sends them silver ""Sake Cups"" when they reach 100 years old Six of the top 10 and twelve of the top 20 oldest people alive.... live in Japan The oldest, Supercentenarian ""Nabi Tajima"" of Kagoshima is the last person alive verified to be born in the 19th century She's 117 and her secret... good sleep and three meals a day But it's got to be more than that, right. DNA could also play a role But, it's still a lottery. Although, Japanese have slightly better odds for those disease-resistant genes Now one or all of these things might be the secret to living a really long life But, I'm not really sure. So, I went to Tottori prefecture to ask the one person who I think knows. She's a hundred and six years old... and she was born in the Meiji era. Certainly, she has the answers Tottori Prefecture is on the Sea of Japan side and I visited Mount Daisen. A place with a great environment for living a long life Mt. Daisen protects the area from typhoons, provides people with lots of pure drinking water, and its location by the sea means excellent fish Daisen Temple on the mountain is celebrating it's 1300th anniversary in summer 2018. A symbol of longevity, for sure And, a place where one of the area's oldest residents lives... Tomiko-San. So, what's her secret? Because I've been working in agriculture I've used my body a lot in the field That trains my body to make it stronger Since I'm working in the field every day It trains my body well So basically if you work hard, you'll be energetic for a long time I've actually never ever been sick You've never caught a cold in your life! Am I right? Never caught a cold, Wow! Oh, great!! Well, I caught cold when I was young But after becoming old, I haven't caught anything at all. I wonder why?  Do you think it's because of your diet? We're careful about what we eat Raised on a farm she's worked hard and eaten well Way back in the beginning, there was an annual health checkup in town and a lot of people had a high blood pressure The Health Inspection Office told us we need to eat soybeans but for kids and old people, it was difficult, so we made Tofu We started to make Tofu ourselves in 1954 and we've been making Tofu ever since Tofu is an amazingly healthy food best made fresh and the family tradition started 65 years ago Continues with Ryo-San who still makes Tofu in the traditional way Tofu was probably made because of its nutritional value, a long time ago now it's made to pursue deliciousness In the past, it was just for nutrition He basically continues to preserve this tradition and also because it's just more delicious to make it yourself a A lot of the family's success is due to the environment and good habits Tomiko-San still walks herself with the help of a chair on wheels And she's surprisingly fast I wanted to see what it was about Tofu. How it is made here So Ryo-San invited me to make it with him starting at 4:30 in the morning It all starts with the soybeans grown on a farm and the pure waters of Mt. Daisen The beans are soaked to absorb the water washed drain And put through a stone grinder that crushes them producing a white milk This is the raw product that will soon become Tofu But before doing that Ryo-San started a wood fire under the cauldron the way Tomiko-San did in the past During the cold months, it keeps the room warm. Although, a little smoky The buckets of unprocessed soy milk gets poured in with ""Nigari"" sprinkled in to help it coagulate It's stirred in and covered to raise the temperature to 90 degrees Celsius. That takes a while The sides are skimmed to prevent any burn taste to the final product This is when Tomiko-San's great-grandson Bunkichi wakes up to help Ryosan make the Tofu He's the heir apparent to take over the tradition and it helps that he's curious about everything, including making Tofu with Grandpa When it reaches close to 90 degrees Celsius, it's strained all the liquids separated from the curd And, the collected curd, it's used later since it has a nutritional value At this point, we have some very delicious soy milk It's naturally sweet and only slightly creamy a very delicate taste It takes about 30 minutes to coagulate at which point Ryo-San transfers it to a cheese cloth in a handmade wooden press It takes time to naturally let the water string through the holes Tofu should be delicate So you don't want to push it if you push hard the Tofu will become hard and rubbery the weights give balance and even pressure When enough water is out Ryo-San extracts the Tofu inside a tub of water where it floats staying protected and in shape He cuts them in large blocks for the customers and his own family to eat for today Customers come from all around the neighborhood with their own bucket to bring some home It's first-come, first-serve I was here first, so I got a cup of the freshly-made Tofu The same recipe Tomiko-San has been making since the 1950s When Tofu is made right, it's very tasty, even on its own. It has a slight sweetness to it And, that diet is one reason for Tomiko-San's happy and healthy life, as she gets closer to a hundred and ten years old Not far away is a market that sells local farmers produce prices are cheaper than at the supermarket And, the farmers bringing it in are all seniors and very strong, doing everything themselves Your hands look super strong! Oh, they are!  Amazing!! Also, because I'm a table tennis player at Japan National Competition She's full of energy, just like Tomiko-San, so the environment certainly plays a role I wanted to get another point of view so a friend recommended I talked with Nakajima-San, who is a Shinto priest near Mt. Daisen He lives next to the shrine in the middle of a farm Visitors to the shrine pray for safe pregnancies and deliveries and a happy and healthy life. What's Nakajima-san's secret to life? Maybe, the simple life makes me like this Not eating luxurious stuff but eating such as brown rice, and farm nearby to cultivate eggplant and pumpkin which I eat daily The area around the shrine really is a farm and exercising. Well, I don't do it anymore because I'm older, but I love moutains so I climbed Mr.Daisen couple of hundred times Also, Japanese Alps, and Mont Blanc in Europe, and some mountains in Nepal So, I believe living with nature being surrounded by it, is what makes a life good Living peacefully and in harmony with nature is a recipe for success in Japan But, that's certainly not the only thing. You got to know how to stay young and have fun, no matter how old you get That's right. He drives a Porsche. He shares the car with others who have a passion for driving like he does On a nice evening like this, why not go for a short drive? And, going around town in a Porsche is just a little more fun We could definitely feel the energy of driving a sports car And, couldn't help, but smile So, I guess the secret to a long life is also about having fun Ask my Japanese neighbors And, what's Mr. Seiichi's secret? He just celebrated his 97th birthday, and only recently retired from his job selling peanuts to customers The secret? It's his passion for life... Karaoke. He even has a favorite go-to song It's ""Enka"" a traditional kind of Japanese ballad He goes to a community center for the elderly three times a week and sings There's a lot of energy to being on stage and singing to others Karaoke is a way to release your mind and stay young He sings at home with his family, too Another secret is to be surrounded by loved ones and seniors often live with their families at home With Karaoke, you can remember those good times and make new memories with neighbors from faraway lands The seniors from today come from a different era, they grew up in the 1930s 40s 50s and 60s They didn't have a lot of stuff, and they lived more humbly It was my generation from the 1970s, 80s, 90s, until today We have so many things like fast food, our diets have changed our lifestyles have changed, and this has made things Well, Let's just put it this way I'm a little bit skeptical that... Japan is gonna be able to hold on the crown for having the longest life expectancy in the world But, if we take some of the lessons from our grandparents and incorporate it into our life today Yeah, there's a pretty good chance that we're gonna live a lot longer and a lot happier, too Next time, Japan has been a leader in video gaming for decades and those old games.

want this pair of leg and she only had three pairs this is crazy this is selling out like crazy the here I am 35 36 years old and I was on my way to be a millionaire instantly I had this huge network of women who just wanted nothing but the best for me I love you guy is her amazing heart everybody everything they did was just fit every party I've ever been to very elaborate felt like the best person ever you felt like a celebrity the quicker you rise the harder you fall then FL you tell the people you love they're in a pyramid scheme and they go no I'm not you're just a hater I own my own business I'm very successful my orders would smell discussed it it was just insane the amount of hoops I had to jump through to get them to ever admit that their product was faulty I would sometimes open bags and they'd be wet you have to look a certain way you have to be a certain way people talk in the company and you would like weird so-and-so and they've like oh you didn't hear all day wouldn't got the surgery surgery bypass pills weight loss they did everything in Mexico everything and then they would come back and girl be snatched beast the more I shared my story the more friends unfriended me they invested all their hard-earned money for you guys and you guys screwed them all I wanted to do is sell some clothes lularoe is a clothing company that empowers moms and everyday women to sell their colorful clothing on social media or at pop-up parties back in 2013 lularoe had just started out and became known for their leggings often brightly patterned and described as buttery soft now Willa Rose sells all types of clothes in different patterns and prints what's different about lularoe is that you could only buy their clothes from at home sellers were referred to as consultants in the company headquartered in Corona California lularoe was started by married couple Marc and Deanne Stidham the company started taking off and by employing their at home sellers they made two point three billion dollars in sales lularoe became more than just a clothing company it became a lifestyle being part of the lularoe family meant big incentives cruises conventions private concerts with celebrities like Katy Perry and Kelly Clarkson this is a story following three women who paid the five thousand dollar minimum to start down the path of a lularoe fashion consultant every order will come as a free pair of leggings hey Anna thank you and their pajama leggings than their dog scarfs right me Roberta Blevins she's a mom living in San Diego California she first heard about lularoe through a friend she met online Roberto was curious about it so she started looking to the company herself I started calling into these opportunity calls that they would have and all of these women were talking about all the success they were having and all the friends and and this sisterhood that was so empowering I was getting very like motivated like I can do this I can sell leggings on the internet this is easy in 2015 the owner Diane would be on these opportunity calls they would be live and she would be talking and I thought that was amazing that the owner of this company would take time out of her day her busy day to sit on a phone call with women and empower them and you choose to be lifted by one another and everything is up in a place where you can make your life better lularoe market themselves as a family-oriented company and would be an opportunity for part-time work for full time pay the idea of making your own schedule and making new friends through social media attracted many moms like Roberta despite her husband's doubts she found a team and paid close to $7000 for her first package I didn't have friends because my daughter was so young and I was stuck at home and then instantly I had this huge network of women who just wanted nothing but the best for me they became like sisters every single time anything good happened I had an entire brigade of women behind me that were like go you and I was like yes and it felt amazing and then we've got white and purple that's Amelia number ten feeling the love Roberta quickly became a part of the lularoe world she was live streaming on Facebook two to four hours a day and customers would watch and shop she was doing all the things they told her to do to be successful including buying a lot of lularoe I was told constantly to reinvest what I made into back into my inventory until I got to a place in my inventory that I was comfortable and I said I don't really know what that means and my upline would say well I would say between five and ten pieces in each size of every style you carry and so my inventory just grew and grew and grew and grew and grew and really got big but my upline kept saying yes yes yes that's that you're in the sweet spot you're exactly where you want to be you can't sell a ton if you don't have a ton two leftover classics and two leftover carly's if anybody is looking for anything like that um and then I have 30 pairs of TC and 30 years of OS so just like so much stuff you guys in lularoe the ranks or trainer and then coach and then mentor so to hit trainer you have to have ten people underneath you and those pea started recruiting people and then my tree went from like me with a few people to this massive tree of people joining under people joining under people joining under people and at the height of it I had 75 girls underneath me for me I am a total like you tell me there's a price and I'm gonna get that prize and so when I found out I got a cool watch that I could show off and be like oh look at me I'm a trainer you know I was like I need that watch it's a picture of momma and Poppa row so thank you for being the kind of leader that you would follow these are the last of the max seeds right here it just felt so empowering and so wonderful and I was somebody in lularoe you know like that's how it felt I was completely addicted to dopamine getting a sale sold 88 dopamine getting a new box dopamine give me more and I remember my upline going oh you'll hit coach no problem you'll hit mentor you'll be mentored by this time next year for Roberta things were at an all-time high across the country in Greenville North Carolina Courtney Harwood was also part of lularoe she joined almost a year before Roberta and reached the coveted status of mentor which was the highest rank in the company Courtney built a team of thirty five hundred women beneath her and collected monthly Commission's that were called bonuses when I had trainer level which is the first level my bonuses were anywhere from around five to ten thousand dollars a month when I hit coach my first coach check was around 11 or 12,000 and got all the way up to $20,000 a month and when I hit mentor my checks got into the thirty thousands per month and my highest bonus check was fifty one thousand dollars for a month I was on my way to being a millionaire those are the kids I took to get our bonus checks we had to buy enough inventory we would sometimes get a fill report and it would have how many items you had bought for the month and then it under it it would have your directs and you got five percent commission off your directs so whatever they had bought for the month they really pushed recruiting not so much sales at all recruiting recruiting recruiting and they even said if it's a warm body take them in lularoe when you recruit someone you get five percent of the money they spent on their orders as long as you yourself order a hundred and seventy five pieces when you reach trainer level in addition to making five percent from your direct recruit you also get three percent from their recruits orders you only qualify for this bonus if your entire team orders at least one thousand seven hundred and fifty pieces in total the chain continues as more people are recruited and this is how people at the top of the chain like Courtney made much more money on recruiting people rather than selling according to guidance issued by the Federal Trade Commission one of the tell-tale signs of a pyramid scheme is when a company promises you'll make money from recruiting others to join rather than selling the product now a multi-level marketing company can recruit people and to be a legitimate business the issue according to the FTC is whether you are making money solely from what your recruits purchase rather than sell in order for more people to rise up in the lularoe ranks more sellers need to be recruited and more clothes needed to be ordered to attract people to the company mentors and other leaders were asked to live their best life and show it as a mentor you were put up on this pedestal I was invited to speak out of state a couple of times and to form the corporate jet their private plane I trusted that they had our best interests at heart I mean I jokingly called the owner mama Dee she I felt like she was a second mom to me I felt like she cared so much and say yeah you do trust on the right your bonus check you're not gonna bite the hand that feeds you everything seemed to be going so well for lularoe they were onboarding tons of people and had a growing army of 80,000 sellers for Cortney she was making way more money than she ever did in her corporate job she was even able to start paying off her debt but by the summer of 2016 things started to break we were growing so fast I don't think the system was big enough Lachey Benson was one of the people hired by lularoe to onboard new recruits she worked in the company's headquarters where she saw a lot of things including where the clothing was stored girl we get stuff delivered all the time and we wouldn't have enough room in the warehouses there would be stacks of clothes sitting outside for days they were strictly about getting their money and that it faulty product started becoming more and more common sellers were receiving clothes with holes wet clothes and even moldy clothes Roberta was also getting defective clothing but was asked to stay mum about it I received at least four different shipments spaced out through the summer of 2016 that had either disgustingly wretched stinky leggings in them or soaking wet leggings all three of these pairs that I got were soaking wet they came so he went here is the tag and so I reached up to my upline and our team page and I said hey I got these leggings and they're soaking wet has anybody else got soaking wet leggings this is really weird they smell like mildew and I remember like it being deleted and then getting an instant message from my sponsor going oh no no you can't post that kind of stuff because it's negative and other people will see it and they might have second thoughts about joining lularoe in April 2017 lularoe implemented a buyback policy which guaranteed consultants 100% of their money back for all unsold merchandise and covered shipping and handling the policy had no expiration there wasn't a time frame which he had to buy the clothes the only stipulation was that you had to have purchased them directly from lularoe with this in mind Deborah Goldman from Rhonda North Carolina join lularoe in May of 2017 and spent $5,000 on her onboarding package unfortunately she soon felt like the cards were stacked against her you would open the boxes and it would smell like old food some of it would have a spots on it and some of it would come in and you would open the packages and it would be wet and Here I am once one closed is this the pair I have a pair that a customer gate oh yeah a customer bought these to wear to Disney World she was really upset because that's what her leggings did see that your fingers go right through and it's not about fit I mean we're talking tiny little people can put these on and the same thing happens Lou the road used to when I first started they had a defective or damages policy that all you had to do was like take pictures and then email it to them and they would send you replacements and all you had to do was like basically swear you know on your honor that you were gonna throw the things away then they changed this whole policy with the damages that you have to keep everything until you have 15 lessons six months after implementing the hundred percent buyback policy lularoe abruptly ended it claiming the retailers were abusing the program Debora heard from other lularoe sellers they returned their merchandise and months later were still waiting for their refund she didn't want to risk it so she thought she'd have a better chance making her money back by trying to sell her remaining inventory Lula Road just said well we can change policy whenever we want doesn't matter what your contract says that was such a slap in the face I wish those people that are signing up to sell it would like call me they could they could just take over my my business I'll just send them everything now I've heard some whining lately also about my inventory scale no you're stale your customers are stale get out and find new customers where is all your stuff anyway the rest of it where are all your racks did you sell everything when you have all my racks - no my rack I thought about like seeing as a goodwill monster buying people started going every time I buy leggings they rip why would I continue to buy lularoe so a lot we lost a lot of customers just because of that I always always said no problem exchange it no problem then I would have a box full of holy leggings if someone would send them back to me or defects smelly ones wet ones moldy ones I remember trying to get my my money back or my credit back so that I could buy new things and just going round and round with them I started to see the scam for what it was and I started to realize like I can't be in this she was always down in the garage selling lularoe then I was always stuck stuck with my dad he's a nice guy though you're stuck with him it's just not the same huh yeah I said I can't do this anymore I'm leaving his personal decision the end it was my sponsor who called me and had a 45 minute phone conversation and turned me around she was like just give it until the end of the year christmas is coming elegant is coming there's so much good stuff coming you're gonna miss it all I was like you're right you're right I'll stay and I came home and my husband was like did you quit and I said no I just I told her I'd stay for three more months because what are you doing you just have to quit it so I sat down I wrote it all out everything that I felt I handed in the iPad and I said proofread it if there's any misspellings or weird and then just hit post and he just goes post and like just goes back to life I'm just watching the news or playing a game or something and I was like it's done it's posted it's out there it's on the internet it's for real now like I'm done I just announced immediately within 15 minutes I got a text message from my sponsor how dare you do this to me how dare you leave without telling me oh I didn't know this was about you all right cool so that friendship is gone ruined it's heartbreaking and then it happened with another person someone that I thought actually cared about me the more I spoke out the more I shared my story the more friends unfriended me it's just it's it's mind games it's cult mind games thank you then I mean I've got pieces that are hard to let go like actually wore this more than one time and there's just there's I guess there's memories attached to some things because I spoke in this when I was in Detroit I believe and so there's that memory attached to it this is a couple thousand dollars worth of clothes then I have closed them at twins bedroom closet it's just over running everywhere when I went on the coaches retreat and felt ashamed because I didn't have a husband there and I took myself shopping and bought this Louis Vuitton purse it was my first ever like really big purchase and it was around $4,000 and then these fobs alone or I think like 275 each and I said you know what I'm buying for the stuff myself because I worked hard I worked so hard for this and I was so proud of myself that I was able to do this I was called by Dan to speak in Detroit and Indianapolis they said to meet in the hotel restaurant for a dinner I see Dan and her son talking about what they're gonna split and Dan looked at me and she goes the reason we split meals is because our stomachs are really small because we've all had the gastric sleeve the N have surgery 23 months ago in how many pounds do you lose the end 72 pounds she goes you know my sister Lee Ellen egg coordinates at all we mean her we'll work with you and you go to Tijuana you have the gastric sleeve then you can come back to my house the next day in California and then we'll fly you home how many people do you know that had done surgery with dr. Michelle excitedly refer to you two I think we brought down a team I counted the other day Beach Dan actually added me to this group chat called the Tijuana skinnies and it was people that had gone down there and they were thinking about going down there Courtney said she felt pressured to undergo the gastric sleeve surgery from Deanne and her sister Lonnie both in and out of the alleged Tijuana skinnies group chat Lynnae I mean she was texting me every day Courtney we've got to get you on the schedule I'm taking six people down there we have room for one more let's go and get on the schedule they hype me up so much to feel so beautiful when I was looking in the mirror I when they're looking at me and I'm fat and I need to have this surgery to be like men I needed to be monitored because of my medications and so my sister actually was the one that said Courtney why don't you try the or bear a balloon in the u.s. first they put it inside of your stomach and they take it out after six months it's not invasive so restraint you had to eat right so I went and had the or bare a balloon put in two days after Christmas I walked down my stairs and I looked at my husband I was like and my eyes were like rolling all around I was like I can't walk anymore we got to the doctor's office and he said she needs this removed immediately the next thing I knew I woke up and I remember looking around and thinking I woke up I woke up I am Alive so of course on the Tijuana skinny's thread people were asking a houseful were bearable and going Courtney how is it going and I said well I had to get it removed I had a really bad reaction to it and I get a text from Lynnae TN sister he said see I told you it wasn't gonna work when can we get out you down to Tijuana to have the gastric sleeve now I was thinking to myself lady I just about died but you don't say no you do not say no and I said well I need to heal a little bit and then I'll I'll get on the schedule so she would text me like every week or two and I'd be like I need some more healing eventually she had to lay off the text because I think I had strung her out enough where she knew that I wasn't gonna go down there next thing I knew I was kicked off the thread because I haven't gone obviously and gotten the gastric sleeve that was taken off the text/chat mom we're gonna have to go through the boutique room - I just because of public scrutiny lularoe decided to change their bonus structure to abide by FTC regulations in July of 2017 bonuses were required to be calculated based on clothes sold instead of clothes bought after the bone structure change Courtney's bonus checks started dropping she felt lularoe was no longer a sustainable business for her October 2nd of 2017 was officially the first mentor to leave lulara poly 150 150 to 200 pieces so this is probably probably about 4000 orth of clothing at $15 each average my lawsuit against them is 450 thousand for what I'm owed and had a set my inventory back that would have been another 50 to 70 thousand dollars I look back and I was like that's what I used to make in a month and now I can make that stretch for a whole year we were always told stick with it your bonus checks we keep going up and that's what I believed and it did it did for a while until started dipping back down and that's when he really got scared and that's when I started trying to like you know really budget more than had it been smart I would have been doing that from the beginning but we were told to live a lavish lifestyle to drive nice cars it would attract more people you were encouraged to take your teams out to dinners I'm embracement ten thousand dollars on a dinner one time we were taught and encouraged to spend every month so we would be dependent on that next bonus check so he couldn't leave when my opinion which was a cult courtney has since filed a lawsuit against the company alleging breach of contract amongst other claims after leaving lulu road she invested in her own boutique which added to her mounting debt i could never pay myself for the goods bought back because i thought the money their money was going to come back to me and i was gonna be able to pay myself back my credit cards and i had to make the decision to let my house go hey Rosie your son for you Courtney alright thank home where to for working with me thank you I don't know where could it go so LaRose mission is to improve lives and strengthen families for Kourtney Roberta and Debra it was a chance to feel like somebody but beyond the colorful marketing materials and the promise of great success Laura didn't live up to the hype now numerous articles cite other dissatisfied sellers thousands have taken to Facebook groups to vent about their own experiences in 2017 there is a class-action lawsuit brought by former consultants against lularoe alleging the company lured them into a pyramid scheme the dispute is ongoing and currently in arbitration in 2018 Lulla rows clothing supplier filed a lawsuit for a breach of contract accusing them of going over 33 million dollars for unpaid merchandise the lawsuit is ongoing in 2019 the Washington state attorney general filed a lawsuit claiming Lou LaRose business model violated state's anti pyramid scheme law that lawsuit is also ongoing overall there have been more than 35 lawsuits against the company for various legal issues six years after lularoe began they're down to 35,000 consultants but continue to actively recruit people into the community I don't think women will speak out because they are afraid they're afraid of losing their friends they're afraid of losing their family they're afraid of being singled out by lularoe and I think the reason that I'm not afraid to speak up is lularoe already took everything from me what I need is real information at this point that's what I need not smoke and mirrors and unicorn and fairy dust I'm not going to sway someone from leaving but if someone asked if they should start lularoe I'll tell them I are absolutely crazy you"

does that make sense so what happened makes me feel better it's as if we're listening to his tapes with his psychiatrist it is just I mean you know the American public prayed for somebody on the political scene who would tell the truth without filters and like the monkey's paw it's come back and bitten them in the butt we have someone you like in America here's someone without filters yeah is this what you want and it's kind of refreshing except that he's wrong about everything yeah but if he weren't wrong course Bernie I think Bernie kind of tells the truth too now a Bernie Sanders yeah by the way you as a libertarian Ron Paul is rolling over in his bed tonight over what his son has said about this Iran deal where it's a very you know Republican war mongering kind of thing this deal is no good and you know we should keep sabre-rattling at a run and so there there is no candidate for you on the libertarian world okay Gary Johnson again at some point you'll be voting you down there yeah so now I believe I believe on the set right now is the first Donald Trump tie to ever make an appearance on this show is that is that a I warned you can you reveal for you I want you to see that this right here is 100% plastic the gold gold is plastic well I want to say very clearly I got this tie for free on Iran Celebrity Apprentice right to the end they start giving you wardrobe that gave this to me free and I said $20 to China so I am not guilty of the exploitation this tie represents so you got out of Celebrity Apprentice you got a free time free time and you got millions in box office sales in Vegas I hear it turns out that's the kind of show and Dancing with the Stars that you're also on that drives an awful lot of Vegas yeah I used to think that when I went on TV I should do what I do like do amazing magic trick stuff turns out that doesn't matter yeah just being on TV will sell tickets and then they come to our show and then they they learn what we uh you know Trump the more I watch him the more I see this there's a childlike aspect him that thing about wanna be loved he really does absolutely true and isn't he incredibly disappointed when people I don't like him he would what I said you know four years ago when I was on the show I said that I didn't think he would be a good president I got called by everybody and said no no he really wants you to support him it's benefiting everybody in the Trump Organization backstage before I lost he said to me you know you really should have supported me for president and mistress you know two years after or something and I said well no I'm not gonna support you for president we're we're doing a reality show this is a joke this has nothing to do where you've gotten to know me and no I mean I do I think everyone who's on Celebrity Apprentice I'm the one who liked him the most because I actually like that kind of crazy nutty obvious and you're gonna round that in show business we're gonna TV show right now we're gonna stay in these seats we're going to tape some more we're gonna put it on the very last word on our website the show on Broadway is Penn & Teller on Broadway the easiest title to remember

0,well Thank You Ryan for putting this panel together it's a topic that everybody brings a different perspective to and if you haven't come to the conclusion yet this is very complicated and it has many different layers and I'm not sure that we're going to be able to get to all of them but we definitely need to open up a discussion about it I lived 8 years as a female named Laura Jensen after undergoing gender reassignment surgery in April of 1983 I started as a 4 year old kid in 1944 so I'm bringing to this conversation today 74 years of first-hand experience in some way either living it or trying to deal with it or trying to recover from it and it's important I think to understand that everything that we've heard today is damaging to children and I was damaged by this and I have some very strong points of view so I hope that don't take exception to them they come out of pain they come out of real-life experience I'm not trying to be hurtful to anybody but I think that I have a website called sex change regret comm and we get letters from either the parents or the transgenders themselves asking for help after they've lived the life like I did 4 5 6 15 18 20 all the way up to 30 years and they're saying Walt can you help me D transition this was the biggest mistake of my life I've met with people personally we've had the honor and pleasure of working with people who are now D transitioning just recently a schoolteacher a pharmacist and a good friend Jamie Shoop I think it's important for us to realize that there is actually nothing good about affirming a young boy four years old like my grandma did me the moment you affirm a child like my grandma dead putting me in a purple chiffon dress and telling me how cute I was how wonderful I looked is the at the very same moment that you're affirming that young person you're telling them there's something wrong with them that you're not right that is child abuse we need to begin calling it what it is it's not affirming a child it's causing them to be depressed and anxious about who they are and then we go on to inject hormone blockers into them and begin altering their body can we begin to understand today from these discussions how destructive this is to the psyche it's no wonder they end up with separation anxiety and bipolar disorder dissociative disorders schizophrenia and many other disorders that they want you to ignore they want to block any child from having access to psychotherapy the only reason that I'm able to speak to you today is because after 46 years of dealing with this issue I was able to D transition in 1990 after I had extensive psychotherapy the very same psychotherapy that they're trying to prevent people from having why because they don't want them to D transition because somebody like me puts a real bad mark on the idea that it's all good because it isn't I've recently written a book trans life survivors that has the stories in them it's painful to get these emails from people whose lives have been totally torn apart men like myself who was married had two children had a career I was executive for American Honda Motor Company one of those therapists who is an advocate for gender change surgery told me that what happened to you as a child wearing that purple dress the only way to solve that is to have cross gender hormones and undergo reassignment surgery that's the solution well I trusted his expertise because dr. Walker had actually written the original international standards of care for treatment of gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria I'm here because he was wrong I'm here because those standards of care have morphed into what they're using today they haven't changed much yeah they've gone through revision after revision but the basic idea is that when somebody comes in they can self diagnose their gender dysphoria we are manufacturing transgender kids we are manufacturing their depression their anxiety and it's turned into a huge industry the people are profiting from after kids lives are completely torn apart the most vulnerable people in our society and adults are tearing their lives apart it's really beyond my understanding why we're even having this discussion because it shouldn't be happening I don't believe any doctor who injects a young person with hormone blockers should have a license to do so I would prefer that they not have that ability and I hope that people begin to realize this and begin to speak up about it there is absolutely nothing good about affirming somebody in a cross gender identity because it destroys their life we won't see the consequences of what they're doing today until 10 or 15 years later and there'll be somebody else speaking up like I am saying it was horrible what they did to me they never should have done it the people are suffering we're not trying to minimize their suffering but why do we abuse them with hormone blockers and cut their bodies apart as a way to affect treatment it's insane actually it doesn't make any sense if we're just to pause and take a sober breath it's insanity when will we finally grasp this Christina Olson a research psychologist in Washington at Washington University and I wrote the article is published in public discourse in 2017 June she said we do not know who the transgender kids are one way or the other we don't know who they are do you get that we don't know who they are does that should sink in they cannot actually identify who trans kids are except by them saying so there is no test there's no proof a parent can actually cause a kid to be gender dysphoria by affirming them the APA which an article is going to come out in the daily signal in the next couple of days that I just finished last night the APA and their handbook in 2014 says kids are not born transgender and yet we're treating them with medical treatment as if they were and trained to alter them they're not born that way I want to say it again we're manufacturing transgender kids none of us should be a party to altering a kid's mind his psyche and sending him down the path where they're gonna sit up here and say how their life was torn apart you know I'm the fortunate one I got sober I'm 33 years sober I drank heavily and used cocaine as a way to try to mask the pain from having undergone the surgery as a way to cope with what grandma did in a purple dress that confused me that when I was a little boy four or five and six years old I began to want to be affirmed I began to enjoy being affirmed I became addicted to the affirmation and the attention I mean if a kid wants to steal all of the attention out of the room all they have to do is say I am a transgender they can suck the life out of a room in a heartbeat and the focus is right on them and they can get anything they want can't they nobody calls him out nobody says how do you how'd you come to this conclusion well we know how they came to the conclusion schools are giving them books they're indoctrinating them parents are encouraging them online they're in chat rooms suggesting groups of kids become transgender it's a fad yes there are people who are Auto guy no philia but there's also people who are deeply troubled over 80% of the people that I've worked with hundreds of people that I've worked with over the last 10 years were sexually abused boys who are abused at a young age come to the conclusion that the only way they can prevent themselves from being sexually abused again is to cut off their genitalia and become females in their mind that is their defense mechanism for sexual abuse girls who are sexually abused want to be men as a way to fend off any intruder or sexual abuser because they will no longer be attractive for sexual abuse whether it's men or women vast majority of them were abused as children many of them I sit with and talk with privately or in their 30s 40s and 50s before they're ever able for the first time to disclose they were sexually abuse is too painful I was sexually abused at nine years old multiple times by my uncle when I told my parents I was sexually abused they said Oh uncle Fred wouldn't do that wrong they said I was a liar so now I had worn a purple dress as a four year old I'd been sexually abused and now I'm a liar you know it's not a real good way to start off life and you're not only nine years old yet we've got to start helping the young people and when people asked for help from me I have one simple thing I always asked them tell me what caused you to not want to be who you are 100 percent of the time they can tell me they can tell me I'm I'm feeling the pain right now of them sharing with me some of these stories because even I weep they're ugly they're horrible they're so deep nobody wants to talk about it but we better start talking about it we're ruining an entire generation of young people and it's serious business I'm not pulling any punches anymore and you shouldn't either thank you
0,">>> BEFORE WE HAD THE NEWS OF  ARETHA FRANKLIN'S PASSING WE HAD PLANNED THIS SHOW ON WHAT  HAPPENS AFTER WE DIE. AS WE MOURN THE QUEEN OF SOUL,  IT SEEMS A PARTICULARLY GOOD  TIME TO ASK, IS THERE SOMETHING  MORE? SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE. ""TODAY"" SHOW TRIES TO ANSWER  THOSE QUESTIONS. MY FIRST GUEST, SHERRY WAS  RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER  WEEKS OF FEELING SHORT OF  BREATH. JUST 10 MINUTES AFTER SHE  ARRIVED, SHE FLAT LINED IN HER  HUSBAND'S ARMS. SHERRY WAS DEAD FOR 90 MINUTES  BUT MIRACULOUSLY CAME BACK TO  LIFE AND NOW HAS A PROFOUND NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE TO SHARE. WATCH. IN EARLY 2008, SHERRY WAS LIVING LIFE TO THE FULLEST.  >> I REALLY WAS LIVING A REALLY  WONDERFUL LIFE IN MY 20s MAKING  GOOD MONEY, EXPERIENCING  FREEDOM, AND REALLY FEELING  ONTON OF THE WORLD.  >> SHERRY'S GOOD LIFE CAME TO  HALT LATER THAT YEAR WHEN SHE  WAS DIAGNOSED WITH HODGKINS  LYMPHOMA.  >> WAITED UNTIL THE DOOR WAS  CLOSED, SAT DOWN. I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP. THAT'S WHEN HE LOOKED AT ME AND  SAID, YOU HAVE CANCER.  >> SHE IMMEDIATELY UNDERWENT  FOUR INTENSIVE ROUNDS OF  CHEMOTHERAPY, CRIPPLING HER  BODY.  >> THERE'S NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE  WHAT THAT CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT WAS LIKE. IT WAS SO EXTREME. I WOULD NOT WISH THOSE SIDE  EFFECTS ON ANYBODY.  >> AFTER BATTLING THE DISEASE  FOR THREE MONTHS, HER CANCER  WENT INTO REMISSION AND SHE WAS  DECLARED CANCER-FREE.  >> IT'S AN INCREDIBLE FEELING TO GO IN FOR THOSE TESTS AND  REALIZE THEY ARE SAYING IT'S  SHRINKING.  >> IN APRIL OF 2010, SHERRY  SUFFERED ANOTHER SETBACK,  CARDIAC ARREST.  >> THE DOCTORS WERE RUSHED IN. THEY IMMEDIATELY PERFORMED CPR. WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE, TEN  MINUTES WERE UNSUCCESSFUL AND  READY TO CALL MY TIME OF DEATH.  >> ONE DOCTOR ORDERED CPR TO  CONTINUE.  >> HE JUST TURNED INTO A DRILL  SERGEANT, AND HE TOLD EVERYBODY  WHAT TO DO. THEY DID CHEST COMPRESSIONS OVER 90 MINUTES, STILL WITHOUT  SUCCESS.  >> SHE WAS PUT ON LIFE SUPPORT  AND RUSHED TO NEW YORK  PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL AND  UNDERWENT OPEN-HEART SURGERY.  >> I KNEW I WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE. I KNEW I HAD DIED. I WOULD SAY INSTANTANEOUSLY WHEN I FLAT LINED I IMMEDIATELY  CROSSED INTO INTO THIS OTHER  REALM. I REMEMBER MY BODY FLOATING IN  THIS WHITE SPACE. I FELT AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER. HE FELT FREE.  >> SHERRY JOINS US NOW. SHERRY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  BEING HERE.  >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >> SO CAN WE -- LET'S GO TO THAT MOMENT IN THE HOSPITAL WHERE YOU WERE FLAT LINING. THEY SAY THAT'S THE MOMENT YOU  ARE DEAD, YOUR HEART IS NOT  WORKING, YOUR HEART IS NOT  PUMPING. IS IT TRUE THEY WANTED TO STOP  CPR. THERE WAS THE ONE DOCTOR WHO  SAID, UH-UH.  >> THEY WERE READY TO CALL MY  TIME OF DEATH. EVERYBODY IN THAT STAFF, IN THAT ROOM, THE EMERGENCY ROOM, THEY  WERE READY TO CALL MY TIME OF  DEATH. ONE LAN MATT ROOM SAID, NO,  WE'RE NOT LOSING HER AND ORDERED EVERYBODY, LIKE A DRILL  SERGEANT, ACCORDING TO MY  FATHER, TO CONTINUE WITH CPR. WHAT THEY HAD TO DO WAS CONTINUE IT LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO  INSTALL TEMPORARY LIFE SUPPORT.  >> WHAT IS THE FIRST MEMORY YOU  HAVE OF YOUR OTHER WORLDLY  EXPERIENCE? >> YEAH. IT WAS PRETTY INSTANTANEOUS FOR  ME. I REMEMBER ONE MINUTE BEING IN  THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT MINUTE  BEING LIKE, I DIED. I KNEW IMMEDIATELY I WAS IN THIS WHITE SPACE WHERE I FELT LIKE I  WAS FORMLESS. I FELT LIGHT AS A FEATHER. I FELT FREE. I REMEMBER FEELING REALLY FREE  OF THE BURDENS OF EVERY DAY  LIFE. >> WAS THERE A FEELING OF PANIC  AT ALL? I'VE DIED. OH, MY GOD, I'VE DIED.  >> IT WAS MORE, WOW, THIS IS SO  BEAUTIFUL.  >> REALLY? >> YEAH.  >> YOU REMEMBER THAT? >> ABSOLUTELY. >> WAS IT ONE OF THOSE THINGS  WHERE YOU WERE ABOVE THE ROOM.  >> IT WASN'T LIKE AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE, I LITERALLY WAS IN A WHOLE OTHER REALM. I WAS NO LONGER IN THE PHYSICAL  HOSPITAL ROOM, I WAS COMPLETELY  IN ANOTHER REALM. I ACTUALLY FELT CONNECTED TO MY  FAMILY ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND I  FELT CONNECTED TO THE HEAVENS. SO THERE WAS NO DISTINCTION OF,  OKAY, I'M DEAD AND IN THIS OTHER WORLD, IT WAS MORE I JUST  GRACEFULLY WALKED THROUGH THIS  TORE AND MADE THIS BEAUTIFUL  TRANSITION INTO ANOTHER REALM.  >> SO THERE'S MUCH MORE TO HER  EXPERIENCE AND WHAT HAPPENED IN  THOSE MOMENTS, INCLUDING AN >>> I'M BACK NOW WITH SHERRY WHO SAYS SHE HAD A LIFE CHANGING  NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE DURING  CARDIAC ARREST WHEN SHE WAS DEAD FOR 90 MINUTES. SO SHERRY, I KNOW YOU'VE SAID  THAT IN THE MOMENT IT FELT LIKE  YOU DID A LIFE REVIEW. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> YEAH. IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY  WASN'T JUST A LIFE REVIEW OF MY  CURRENT LIFE, IT WAS ACTUALLY A  LIFE REVIEW OF ANY EXPERIENCE MY SOUL HAD EVER UNDER GONE, WHICH  IS SO CRAZY, SO CRAZY TO ME.  >> DID YOU BELIEVE IN PAST LIVES PRIOR TO THAT MOMENT.  >> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A NEAR  DEATH EXPERIENCE WAS UNTIL I GOT BACK. THIS WAS ALL VERY FOREIGN TO ME. I HAD HEARD MAYBE OF PEOPLE THAT HAD HAD AN OUT OF BODY  EXPERIENCE. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT THIS MEANT. SO YEAH, THIS WAS DEFINITELY  VERY, VERY FOREIGN FOR ME.  >> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT A  WINDOW INTO PRIOR LIVES? >> ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, THE BIGGEST THING I  REALLY LEARNED WAS, I LEARNED -- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WE HAVE THIS COMMON RECURRING THEME THAT'S  HAPPENING IN OUR LIVES, WHETHER  IT'S POOR FINANCES OR  RELATIONSHIP TROUBLE, I GOT TO  LEARN DURING MY LIFETIME REVIEWS WHAT THAT COMMON THEME WAS AND  HOW TO CLEAR IT.  >> WOW.  >> WHAT HAPPENED WAS, IT WAS  ATTACHING TO MY SOUL DURING  EVERY LIFETIME.  >> I'M SORRY, BUT I BELIEVE  THAT. I FEEL LIKE THAT'S PART OF  KARMA. YOU KEEP GETTING THE CHANCE TO  GET IT RIGHT AND EVENTUALLY  HOPEFULLY YOU DO AND MOVE ONTO  THE NEXT PLANE. I REALLY THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT.  >> YES.  >> THE NOTION OF BEING DEAD BUT  NOT DEAD IS CONFUSING TO PEOPLE. >> YEAH.  >> WE HAVE A DOCTOR HERE, HIS  NAME IS DR. SAM PARNIA, AUTHOR  OF ""ERASING DEATH"" WHICH SOUNDS  LIKE A GREAT IDEA, DOC. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.  >> PLEASURE.  >> HOW COULD SHE BE DEAD BUT NOT DEAD FOR 90 MINUTES.  >> IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION, OF COURSE. THE REALITY IS WE ALL HAVE A  PERCEPTION OF DEATH. THIS GOES BACK MILLENNIA, DEATH  IS A MOMENT. YOU'RE EITHER ALIVE OR DEAD. THE REASON WE THINK THAT, WHEN  THE HEART STOPS, YOU HAVE NO  MORE BLOOD FLOWING INTO YOUR  BRAIN, ORGANS, BRAIN SHUTS DOWN, A PERSON ISS LIFELESS,  MOTIONLESS, DEAD. EVEN IF YOU DO BACK TO THE  FRENCH REVOLUTION WHEN SOMEBODY  LOST THEIR HEAD, THERE'S NO MORE BLOOD GETTING TO THE BRAIN AND  IT SHUTS. WHAT'S AMAZING 50 OR 60 YEARS  AGO WE FOUND CPR. WE FOUND YOU COULD ARTIFICIALLY  PRODUCE CIRCULATION, GET BLOOD  FLOWING AROUND THE BODY EVEN  AFTER A PERSON DIED. THAT MADE OUR DEFINITION SZ MORE AMBIGUOUS. WHAT IS MORE INTERESTING, WE  UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S ONLY AFTER  A PERSON DIED, WHICH MAKES  PERFECT SENSE, THE CELLS INSIDE  THE BODY START TO UNDERGO THEIR  OWN PROCESS OF DEATH. SO WHEN SOMEBODY'S HEART STOPS,  IT'S ONLY THEN THAT THE CELLS  WILL START TO DIE. THAT PROCESS TAKES MANY HOURS,  POSSIBLY DAYS.  >> HOW HAS YOUR OUTLOOK ON DEATH AND LIFE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF  THIS EXPERIENCE? >> I AM DEFINITELY NO LONGER  AFRAID OF DEATH. THAT WAS SOMETHING I HAD FEARED  MY ENTIRE LIFE. WHAT I LEARNED IS THAT THAT FEAR OF DEATH REALLY PREVENTS YOU  FROM TRULY LIVING. AND SO IF YOU WERE TO KNOW ME  PRIOR TO MY NEAR DEATH  EXPERIENCE AND NOW, IT'S LIKE  I'M TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT  PEOPLE. I LIVED PRE-NEAR DEATH, I LIVED  MY LIFE -- ALL MY DECISIONS WERE BASED AROUND FEAR. FEAR OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE  THOUGHT, FEAR OF WHAT OTHER  PEOPLE WOULD SAY, FEAR OF NOT  BEING GOOD ENOUGH, OR FEAR OF  BEING UNWORTHY. EVEN THOUGH I WAS SUCCESSFUL IN  MY EARLIER YEARS, EVERY DECISION WAS STILL BASED UPON THAT. NOW I FLIPPED THE SCRIPT. I'M DOING EVERYTHING DIFFERENT.  >> I LOVE THAT. I COMPLETELY BELIEVE IN THAT. I THINK IF YOU'RE MAKING  DECISIONS OUT OF FEAR IN  GENERAL, YOU'RE MAKING THEM OUT  OF THE WRONG PLACE. I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE WELL. YOU GOT YOUR NEW HEART. YOU GOT YOUR NEW HEART. YOU LOOK AMAZING."
-1,"There's a lot of stuff out there trying to kill us right now, and today I'm going to talk about the ones that are the best at it. The five deadliest infectious diseases in the world. Now do your self a favor, put away any food you might have nearby you and if you have a dog you might want to move it into another room. You might be tempted to say the monstrous bastards I'm about to talk about are the deadliest organisms in the world but that wouldn't really be true, because of all of the diseases that you're going to hear about today are caused by viruses and as you know viruses are just protein covered scumbags full of nucleic acid so they're not generally considered living things but still you got to hand it to them viruses have probably been around for at least 10's of millions of years and have managed to make a great living by ripping off our DNA like they're the fricking pirate bay and using it to copy themselves and pretty much master our asses for as long as there have been warts. But I'm not talking about warts here, guys, it's much worse than that. I'm talking about the diseases with the highest known case fatality rates which is how experts measure the deadliness of a disease the percentage of people diagnosed with it who end up dying from it Remember the Spanish flu? 1917 to 1918, killed like 30 million people world wide and basically changed the course of modern history That was a strain of a virus called H1N1 and it had a case fatality rate of like 10 to 20 percent Viruses I'm talking about are so much deadlier by comparison that Spanish flu is not even worth calling in sick for. Take for instance Nipah which has an average case fatality rate of about fifty percent It's named for a town in Malaysia were it was discovered in 1999 among pig farmers Seems a bunch started coming down with severe respiratory problems and inflammation of the brain that caused hallucinations and seizures and not the good kinds... Wait, there's good kinds of seizures? Outbreaks soon followed in India and Bangladesh, this time among people who had eaten fruit that was tainted by bats that carried the virus The death rate in some of these out breaks was 100 percent and there are no treatments or vaccines for the virus But what's really pants-poopingly terrifying about Nipah is that it soon proved to be easily transmissible among humans no pigs or bats or pig-bats required. In 2001 there was an outbreak in the town of Siliguri in India and seventy-five percent of those cases were traced back to people who had visited the local hospital Just by being in that building, they got it. But hey, that doesn't affect you, right? Because, odds are, you're not a pig farmer and you're also probably not watching from your home in Siliguri Well, no doubt you've heard of H5N1. The virus formally known as ""bird flu"" has been making the rounds mainly in Asia and Europe where it's often fatal to birds Luckily, it's rarely contracted by people and it's not very good at jumping from person to person until now You may remember a while back when I told you about how scientists genetically engineered bird flu to make it contagious among ferrets and that's important because ferrets essentially have the same immune system as humans. Don't ask me why It's assumed that these new strains are contagious to us as well which kinda sucks because the World Health Organization says that H5N1 kills at least fifty-four percent of the people who get it usually from respiratory problems Now, there is a vaccine for the strain that's out in the world right now, but at least in the US, it's been stockpiled by the government and hasn't been made available by the public yet As for the strains that were made to be made to be contagious between mammals they are currently kept under lock and key in labs in Wisconsin and the Netherlands hopefully big locks with thumb print and retinal scan and voice activated. and some of the scientists who monkeyed with the virus have said they've developed a vaccine at least for the strains that they've invented so that's great they can release it on the world and then sell the vaccine that'll be great business for them ""Now, Hank,"" you're saying, ""I'm not a Malaysian bat handler, and I've already stocked my pantry enough skittles and diet sierra mist to get me through the bird flu pandemic."""
0,an atheist a vegan and a crossfitter walk into a bar i only know because they told everyone within two minutes what's cooking i'll tell you what's cooking this delicious meat bbq wanna come over and have some no i'm vegan remember ah yes sorry i forgot you eat grass how could you forget i literally made you lose your job when i got that fast food restaurant you worked at closed down oh that i got a new job what job i hope you don't abuse animals like your last one at a slaughterhouse lol when you are vegan and haven't told anyone in eight minutes why do vegans always try to make food that looks and tastes just like meat why do you care so much what vegans eat gosh stop being so triggered ugh why do you care so much about what i say do you have a thing for me i'm flattered but i don't think your reproductive capabilities are ideal after eating so much soy thanks and play again so i went to a group meeting yesterday at rpi for a professor who shall remain unnamed at this group's meetings if you are presenting you are responsible for making lunch or dinner for everyone so the person presenting apparently is a vegan and brought vegan food to the meeting the professor calmly assesses the spread and asks where the meat option is the student seems offended by this and states that she does not have to provide a meat option as eating meat is a choice you don't need meat to live the professor counters by stating that every other time food is made a vegan option is provided for her at her request she argues for another minute and then states well i don't know what you want me to do about it now to which the professor tosses her his phone and says domino's is speed dial five i think three large meat lovers will do it kind of a bad move yes made my evening most definitely i'm vegan too no way yeah that's why i swiped right haha that's amazing how long have you been vegan for start of this conversation vegans are 12 avogado 18 almond milk and 70 rehearsed

indigenous tribes that have been completely wiped out by corporate death squads who didn't even bother to give them the chance to run for their lives before murdering them for land and money or are you just willing to admit you care more about a pretentious fictional moral high ground gained by not eating animals than you do about human right and environmental issues when vegans kiss give a man

from a once living breathing sentient animal who didn't want to die actually i would feed more comfortable it would make choosing fresher meat easier that is a very good idea if any of you are vegetarian send me some recipes or something lettuce wakey wakey eggs and bacon but i'm vegan wakey wakey vegetables and sadness if meat eating is so good for you then why are thick headed people

0,"What potential disasters keep you up at night? Meteor strikes? Super Volcanos? World War Three? World war Z? Those are all pretty scary and we didn't even mention climate change but there's one other immediate terrifying, scientific problem that rises above the rest... Superbugs I'm not talking about giant spiders of Mirkwood or tracker jackers. I'm talking about antibiotic resistant bacteria. Which  by the way are everywhere. Antibiotics are pretty incredible. Since the discovery of penicillin they have extended the average human life by about 10 years. A good percentage of the people watching this right now are only alive today because at some point an antibiotic saved their life. But we're facing a little bit of a crisis. Antibiotics are starting to loose their effectiveness as bacteria continue to outsmart our technology. And I don't wanna make you too paranoid here, but the consequences could be big. Remember that little thing called the black death - a pandemic that ravaged Europe and Asia in the 1300s, killing about, meh, 25 mln people. That wouldn't have happened if antibiotics were a thing back then, but if our drugs stop working now, could it happen again? The US Centers for Disease Control estimates that 23,000 American died in 2012 from antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And the World Health Organization says that in 2010 about half a million people were infected with a resistant strain of tuberculosis, a third of whom died. A post-antibiotic era could essentially mean the end of modern medicine and suddenly a simple operation, sinus infection or a scraped knee could once again have the potential to kill. Now, I'm not saying you should be worried about this. Actually, yeah, I'm saying you should be worried about this. When Scottish physician Alexander Fleming got out of bed one September morning in 1928 he had no idea that he was about to change the world. Fleming had seen countless soldiers die from infected wounds and since the 1st World War ended, he'd been working hard to find better antibacterial agents. He was a good guy and a good scientist, but he was also a bit of a slob. So that morning he was straightening a stack of Petri dishes, where he'd been growing a staphylococcus bacteria, when he noticed mold in one of the dishes. Now, his lab was messy enough that that wasn't that weird, but what caught his eye was that all around the mold the bacteria was dead. He later identified that mold as penicillium notatum. Years of experimentation followed and after enlisting the help of researchers Howard Florey and Ernst Chain the team figured out how to grow and use the fungus to treat bacterial infections. Mass production began during World War II and by D-Day in 1944 all allied soldiers had penicillin, the world's first antibiotic. For their work Fleming, Florey and Chain were awarded the Nobel Prize. And, for the next 50 years, or so, antibiotics were unbeatable, saving lives left and right. But lately they've struggled to perform as well as they used to. Before we talk about exactly what antibiotics are and how they work, you have to understand what they're up against. Bacteria!!!! Take a look around your room. Everything, your chair, your sandwich, your dog, your body - inside and out - it's all covered in millions and millions of different single-celled bacteria. They can pretty much survive anywhere. Even in radioactive waste and in the absence of light and oxygen. But unlike viruses, which need a host cell to reproduce and survive, bacteria can thrive everywhere, because they can share their genetic material with each other. This is the key to their evolving resistance to antibiotics. While some bacteria have genes that make them resistant to like heat, so they can live in boiling water, other bacteria may be resistant to penicillin and both kinds can share what they know. We get our genes from our parents and what we're born with we're stuck with our whole lives. Bacteria, however, like to do things a little differently. They don't to use traditional reproduction to pass their genes along. They can use something called horizontal gene transfer to swap genetic information, like you swap Pokemon cards. And one of the best ways bacteria acquire new genes is to loot their neighbors' body when they degrade and die. This process is known as transformation, although some pathologists have dubbed it ""the funeral grab"". It happens when bacteria are in a special physiological state called competence, during which they can scavenge bits of foreign DNA from their environment. So say Bobby bacterium dies and then Benny bacterium creeps up and grabs whatever genes it wants. So if Bobby was resistant to cold and Benny grabbed that gene, now Benny is suddenly cold resistant. And if Bobby was resistant to a certain antibiotic, boom, now Benny is too. Another way bacteria exchange genetic materials is by passing viruses, also known as transduction. Viruses can infect bacteria just like any other organism and because viruses are just bits of RNA or DNA, they can jump into a bacterium, latch onto some genes and then jump to a different bacterium, transferring those genes in the process. So that's like I caught the flu from you and with it I got your mother's eyes. The third way bacteria exchange traits is through conjugation, which is kind of like sex. So let's say Bobby and Benny E. coli are feeling frisky and Bobby builds a gene passing connection over to Benny and when they break apart Benny can now do something that only Bobby could do before. So you see where this is going. A particular strain of bacteria could suddenly become resistant to an antibiotic by catching a virus, robbing a dead friend or by having sex with a live one. And just like the evolution of any other organism the bacteria that acquire the toughest, most resistant traits become more fit, more adaptable to a range of environments, and are thus more likely to survive and thrive. So in a way the superbug phenomenon, that's going on right now, is kind of like watching natural selection played out in fast-forward, which is cool and scary. But now you have a sense of how high the stakes would be if say a resistant strain of the plague started moving around the globe. But luckily, for the last 70 years, or so, we've had antibiotics, also called antimicrobials or antibacterials. And they work by either destroying the bacteria or slowing their growth enough that the human body's own immune system can finish the job. Basically an antibiotic is a selective poison designed to find, bind and kill bacteria, without damaging their host cells in your body. These drugs usually work by attacking a unique bacterial target, like a particular protein, or a bacterial process, like the way they build a cell wall or metabolise sugar. For example most bacteria build their cell wall using a specific combination of sugars and amino acids, a combination that our cells don't use. So antibiotics like penicillin block the production of that material, so the bacteria's wall is weakened and bursts. Other antibiotics may attack bacteria's metabolic pathways. All cells require folic acid, aka vitamin B9, to function. This vitamin easily passes into human cells, but it can't enter bacterial cells. So bacteria have to make their own. The sulfa family of antibiotics, made from a sulphur compound, works by disrupting the production of this vitamin, thus inhibiting their growth. And then there's tetracycline, which combats infection by attacking how bacteria make protein. Tetracycline can get through bacterial membranes and disrupt protein production, enough to inhibit cell growth, while human cells remain safe. But as amazing as antibiotics are, they've got a really smart enemy and bacteria have a few effective ways of wriggling out of the crosshair. For one, some bacteria can basically just barf up the antibiotic when it gets inside it's cell. They use their chemical energy to fuel what are essentially pumps that spit the antibiotics right back out of the cell, before it can do any harm. They may also get kind of sneaky and change the drugs target, so that the antibiotic can't find what it's supposed to destroy, because many antibiotics work only in a very specific molecule. If a bacterium can replace that molecule or rearrange it's structure, that antibiotic can't do it's job. Bacteria can also go on the offensive and basically make a weapon that looks for and breaks down antibiotics. For example, some strains can produce enzymes that destroy penicillin by breaking open the compound that's basically it's active ingredient. And, of course, once a bacterium has figured out a good resistance it can pass that information along to it's neighbors, through sex or viruses or pilfering and then it's on to other human and animal hosts who travel all over the globe by land sea and air. And then it's ""goodbye drugs - hello plague"". So now you might be wondering - well, can't we just develop new antibiotics? Well, we've already gone after bacteria's most obvious targets. And what's left are increasingly difficult alternatives. Basically, new classes of antibiotics will be a lot harder to discover and develop. We're probably not gonna find them in a moldy lunch box. However, researchers at Oregon state university and other institutions around the world are working on a promising new antibacterial agent, called PPMOs. Lab studies have shown, that one type of PPMO has been really effective at controlling some kind of bacteria that I can't pronounce. Which happens to be responsible for a lot of hospital infections. PPMOs are lab synthesized analogs of DNA or RNA. They target a bacterium's genes, instead of just disrupting it's cellular function. Although they haven't been tested on humans yet, PPMOs may offer a totally different approach to fighting bacterial infections and possibly even other diseases with genetic components. Other researchers are looking at fighting superbugs with viruses. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect and destroy bacteria and spread to other bacteria. These phages are naturally occurring and can be found all over the place, including soil, river water and the human body. Each phage is specific to a particular type of bacteria and needs the proper host to multiply. The more targets it has, the faster the virus spreads and kills, making it especially effective against high concentrations of bacteria or chronic infections. You only need a tiny bit of the virus, which can be administered through a cream or a spray. And, so far, they don't seem to infect human cells and they haven't contributed to antibiotic resistance. So even though the risk of superbugs taking over the world is real and scary, we do have some reasons to be hopeful. And, in the meantime, there are some things you can do to help. First, it's important to understand when you should and shouldn't use anitbiotics. You don't wanna gobble them up every time you feel kind of poopy. You might have a virus and antibiotics won't help that. Antibiotics should be a last resort reserved for serious infections, when other treatments haven't worked. And if you do need them, make sure you take them exactly as prescribed until the bottle is empty. Stopping early only makes the surviving bacteria stronger. Likewise, never take antibiotics without a prescription. No passing along left-over medication. And of course make sure you wash your hands, use soap, get vaccinated. If you prevent illness, you prevent the need for medications in the first place. The future peoples of earth will thank you.

welcome for my surface okay well all right fair enough that's kind of cheap but okay That's not me hating on veterans by the way no people are gonna take it as that but that's not the case swapping labels on food so vegetarians unexpectedly eat meat some mornings I like to pop into Tesco and switch the cardboard sleeves around all these just for fun yeah that's actually that's actually really messed up that's I'm not a vegetarian or vegan myself but I understand it that's stuff you should never do that that's essentially tampering with food which is a crime and you can get a lot of trouble for that don't do that guys don't do that let's make a PSA we've caught my niece was excited to show me her new boyfriend I decided to stalk his facebook as all overprotective aunts too and this is the first picture I see oh god he's got the cat in one hand and a swastika tattoo yikes from me another gem of the valet oh no no go away that's actually disgusting I don't understand how can you how can you let that happen to your car like cars aren't hard to keep clean cars are so easy to keep clean Jesus Christ I decided to stop smoking lately started my Redemption by cleaning all the cigarettes I was throwing under the table in my backyard I don't understand why this bursted too trashy but yeah good job I understand that the smoking is it's hard to quit I'm glad you're doing it because well it kills it's really bad for you and no one likes the smell of a smoker like smikers I'm sorry but it doesn't smell good lifeguard fired for saving a man's life take the way down over there that way down over there so I just started running darting past hordes of beachgoers Monday to save a drowning man instead of being rewarded he was fired you see the 21 year old knowingly violated a rule that prevents guards from this privately-run lifeguard company from leaving their stations to help a swimmer in distress he's serious and they'll have to do because someone's life was at stake Tommy's guards dead that's ridiculous that's so stupid so what it was to save a man's life brides mother-in-law wearing a wedding dress to the wedding yikes my mother-in-law wore a wedding dress to my wedding so yeah top that one twitter hashtag a wedding fail at Jimmy Fallon that is so disrespectful that is horrible why would you do that ever what's the excuse like what is the excuse someone's stealing a PlayStation 4 from a kids hospital due to a thief incident we are no longer able to leave the PlayStation 4 out overnight on the play team that's just sad that's just actually sad it's a Children's Hospital dude like that's just sad if there's nothing else to add to that mom refuses to pay for cheap toys so kids break if my kids break something at a store I won't pay for it here's why I'm sorry but if your kid breaks something at a store you'll either weren't watching them or you willingly let them do it so it is your fault in the matter what I'm sorry but you have to pay for it my cousins from Arkansas okay do I need to add anything to this I don't think I do Oh God Oh God I know how to judge a book based on its cover but um yeah okay all right yep moving on commenting on the appearance of someone who has battled addiction and depression scuffie Perry friend star looks unwell and dished shaven as he makes rare public appearance in New York City now I leave the guyline and tabloids like the tail email it's just sad it's just it's just sad why what give the guy a break okay just because you're old doesn't mean you can't be treated like an ass when

way to leave a shitty tip for someone oh come on light stuff in America earn like two dollars fifty an hour before tips if this is what you're gonna do to make them earn a tip you're disgusting Jesus that is horrible miserable I'm sorry to the waiter or the waitress that had to deal with this that is that's horrible alright that's a really tax t-post so we're skipping it because I can't be stopped reading this planet does not deserve this fill out into a river really that's disgusting I feel like I don't need to say that you shouldn't dump rubbish into a river apparently this is in India which I'm sorry to say but it doesn't surprise me they seem to have a lack of care for their environment and in recent news they've got a city of ten million people that's fresh out of water us so I don't know you think they'll learn I don't know that's just me and the company you've worked for for 15 years eliminates your position and then post a countdown to your termination on the company's homepage that's gonna suck man I'm sorry bro that's like some Michael Scott level of disrespect the ways the HR guys boys HR as someone who just started their own little outdoor garden I'd be so pissed it is no longer pretty fever still 29 plants and the police are involved 29 plants I don't understand theft of plants like I had a teacher who once told me a story about his roses got stolen like dug up and stolen why if you are that desperate to have a good looking garden hi is somebody who can look after it Congress doesn't show up for work to honor our heroes dude political moving on here's a tip it's trashy as health to leave fake money as a tip that advertises your candidate surely that's illegal surely that's illegal that that's got to be illegal right there's gonna be a law or something against it surely surely a reputable company framing an employee for petty revenge a Chipotle manager who was five for stealing six hundred and twenty six dollars just won an eight million dollar lawsuit after it turned out they framed her as a revenge for filing workman's comp carpal tunnel syndrome that's just horrible why didn't I hear about this surely this sort of made like international news right that's ridiculous I heard the managers happy at least the eight million dollars that's a lot of money um I've never heard of this before that's that's ridiculous like Jesus that is so trashy all

and yeah just watching have a nice day stole that from boyinaband don't worry about it you
0,"Going to the doctor’s office is almost always
 a bummer. Even if you’re not deathly ill, there’s
 the whole ordeal of actually getting out of the house and then filling out forms and waiting
 around reading old magazines for what seems like eternity. So it’s not surprising that home remedies
 are pretty popular, but do they actually work? I should probably point out that I’m not
 a doctor, so if you have any questions about what can and can’t be treated at home, you should definitely ask someone with medical training. But studies by actual doctors have found that
 even some of the most well-known home  remedies don’t work, and sometimes they do more harm
 than good. And for these six, science says it’s time
 to find an alternative. Honey can be kind of wonderful when you’re
 sick. It has antibacterial powers, and if nothing
 else, it adds a little sweetness your sleepy 
 time tea. But one thing it doesn’t seem to do is reduce
 allergies. You might have heard that eating local, raw
 honey can prevent you from experiencing seasonal allergies. Because this honey is made from the plants
 around you, it’s thought that it provides controlled exposure to the stuff causing your allergies kind of like an allergy shot would. And we know that those can cut down your allergic
 response. There are even tablet versions for ragweed
 and grass pollen allergies, so you can fight 
 allergies with your mouth. But studies suggest honey just doesn’t do
 the job. Most of the pollen in honey is from flowers
 that rarely cause allergies. But more importantly, even super raw, unfiltered
 honey straight from the hive just doesn’t have that much pollen in it, less than half
 a percent by weight. And clinical studies suggest that’s just
 not enough. For example, researchers at the University
 of Connecticut tested 36 people with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, aka classic allergy sufferers,
 complete with runny noses and red, puffy eyes. The participants ate a daily tablespoon of
 either raw, locally sourced honey, processed honey, or a placebo, and maintained a diary
 of their symptoms for 10 days. But in the end, neither honey-eating group
 reported more allergy relief than the placebo. A different study did find that spiking honey
 with an allergy-causing pollen could help, so there might be a way for scientists to
 create a honey-based allergy treatment. But that would mean a lot more research to
 design something that probably will end up being a lot like the tablets we already have. Though maybe you could use it to sweeten your
 tea, too. Now this one wasn’t some kind of pre-tanning
 bed bronzing strategy. Putting butter on a toasty patch of skin used
 to be considered a viable home remedy for thermal burns. The treatment started on the battlefields
 of 19th century Europe because it was thought that deep burn wounds needed protection from air. Even in the early to mid 20th century, butter
 and oils were used on burns that started to blister or char. These days, we know better. Butter, coconut oil, and pretty much any greasy
 goo of your choosing will trap heat, which is the opposite of what you want to do with
 a thermal burn. Doctors say the key to a speedy recovery is
 cooling such burns ASAP, and certainly within in the first 48 hours. This not only makes the burn less severe,
 it reduces pain, something you probably want if you just burned yourself. It’s actually a little weird that cooling
 works so well even if the application is a little delayed, considering the actual temperature
 of your skin goes back to normal within a few minutes. But in animal studies, even delayed cooling
 of burns helps decrease swelling, preserve blood flow to the skin, and reduce healing
 time, though sooner is better. And you might think ice water would be top
 choice since it cools quickly, but research is mixed. That’s because it’s hard to judge how
 cold things are when you’re burned, so you might overdo it and get frostbite… ironic
 as that may sound. And that’s why international burn associations
 and first aid organizations usually recommend gently cooling down a burn for 10 to 20 minutes
 with cool to room temperature water. And they’re also pretty clear about not
 using butter. The only real exception to the no butter rule
 seems to be if your burn is caused by hot tar. In that case, something slick like butter
 can help remove the sticky stuff, but it’s probably still best to go to the doctor. Parents of young children are all too familiar
 with head lice. These extremely contagious little vermin can
 climb aboard when your hair or head touches someone else’s, though probably not via
 hats or combs like we used to think. And they set up shop on your scalp, sucking
 your blood and making it itch like crazy. Getting rid of them usually means doing laundry
 constantly, picking at hairs for hours, and multiple head washes with annoyingly expensive
 medicated shampoos, that it turns out some lice have become resistant to. So it’s no wonder many hope household items
 can take them out instead. Unfortunately, one common go-to, vinegar,
 just isn’t effective. It’s thought that the acidic liquid might
 harm or suffocate the little critters. But when researchers tested a handful of different
 home remedies by dipping human hair  samples in different products, the vinegar-drenched
 tufts had almost no difference in adult lice or egg content after 8 hours, the time ofa typical overnight treatment. The researchers also found the lice were able
 to survive over 24 hours without food, and some even made it through 12 hours without
 air. Other things they tried did seem to work better
 than vinegar, though, like petroleum jelly. But I still wouldn’t get too excited, since
 some lice and eggs survive the jelly, too. So it will still require multiple applications
 and a lot of hair brushing to get rid of the lice completely. There’s simply no quick and easy way to
 rid your head of lice, other than to completely shave off your hair. Now, this might come as a shock, but swallowing
 poison isn’t a good idea. So for decades, people used to stock their
 medicine cabinets with a product called ipecac syrup. Made from dried bits of a Costa Rican plant,
 it could used to induce vomiting if their kid ate some rat poison or something. It was such a common remedy that you used
 to be able to find it in any big drug store. But as of 2010, American manufacturers stopped
 producing it altogether because it doesn’t work. Well, I mean, it does make you throw up. Ipecac syrup is an emetic: a substance that
 causes you to vomit. But the act of vomiting doesn’t do all that
 good a job of ridding your body of poison. When you purge, you don’t always completely
 empty your stomach. And any delay between ingestion and vomiting
 gives your body time to absorb a poison. Which is why research in 2005 concluded that
 when it comes to removing toxins, vomiting isn’t as effective as other treatments. And taking the time to drink ipecac and vomit
 can delay or even interfere with better options like activated charcoal. Also, some of the side effects of ipecac syrup
 are similar to the effects of some poisons, which makes the diagnosis more confusing for
 your doctor. So these days, most major toxicology authorities
 agree that no matter what you’ve ingested, you shouldn’t reach for ipecac. If you’re really concerned that you or a
 family member has ingested poison, call your local poison center, call 911, or just go
 to the hospital. People’s main priority when they get a nosebleed
 is usually to stop the fountain of blood coming out of their nose as quickly as possible. So it’s no wonder that many people think
 the best treatment for epistaxis, that’s the medical term for a nosebleed, is to tilt
 your head back. And it works! I mean, it stops the blood from dripping down
 your face, but it doesn’t stop the blood from flowing. Human noses are full of blood vessels, so
 when there’s a bleed, there’s often a lot of blood and all that blood has to go
 somewhere. The main danger with the head tilt method
 is that you can actually choke on your own blood. Your nose is connected to your throat, you
 know, where your windpipe and esophagus are, by a tube called the pharynx. So when you tilt your head back, you can block
 or flood your windpipe with blood. Or all of it can travel straight to your stomach,
 which can cause irritation and vomiting. Which is why doctors say to do the exact opposite: tilt your head forward while keeping your head above your heart. And just catch the blood in a towel or something. Studies have suggested that pinching your
 nose just below the bridge for 5 to 10 minutes can help, that applies pressure to the most
 likely bleeding point. Or, a cold compress may help by giving you
 some much needed pain relief. So you can try that, too, but if the blood
 just doesn’t seem to stop coming, then calling a doctor isn’t the worst idea. If you’ve ever had pink eye or conjunctivitis,
 you have my sympathy. Pink eye is highly contagious and extremely
 common in both kids and adults. And the pain, swelling, and redness just,
 sucks. As if to make matters worse, doctors often
 don’t prescribe anything, not even medicated eye drops, preferring to just wait it out. So a desperate desire to do something to speed
 things along might be why someone came up with the idea of covering infected eyes with
 boiled tea bags. And it’s not as far-fetched as it might
 seem. The main symptoms of pink eye stem from inflammation, which is an immune response usually triggered by a viral or bacterial infection. Chamomile, a common component of teas, does
 have some anti-inflammatory properties. But there’s no evidence that chamomile-filled
 tea bags help with pink eye. People who swear by this method might be picking
 up on something else: the heat. For reasons that aren’t completely understood,
 applying heat often reduces pain. So basically, those tea bags might be acting
 like a hot towel. And in all fairness, you’re probably not
 doing any harm by covering your eyes with hot tea bags, so long as they aren’t hot
 enough to burn you. So I guess if you need an excuse to brew a
 quick pot of tea and take a nap, more power to you. Nowadays, it is super easy to find all kinds
 of different medical advice, but just because a treatment comes up in a search or has been around awhile doesn’t mean it’s good. If you use one of the “home remedies”
 we just talked about, you could be making the whole experience that much worse. So before you follow age-old idioms or even
 the sage advice of Google, you probably want to check with a trusted medical resource. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow! And if you want to learn more about medical

six years to do a complete reversal of fortune this person is stupid you're a millionaire but you work at a bakery where you're lucky to make $20 in tips a day yet another person exposed by the brilliant tool of simply looking up someone's reddit post history so which one is it do you want us to feel bad for you because you work a low-wage job or do you want us to respect you because you so simply broke out of poverty to become a millionaire within six years because you can't have it both ways when coloring dark skinned hands okay so I've seen a lot of artists including myself make this common mistake of coloring the palm of a hand and the sole of a foot as the same color as a person's skin tone but in fact palms and soles are a different color compared to our skin this is due to the lack of melanin on them hope this helps don't put this whitewashing baloney on my feet one kind tumblr user provides multiple examples of darker skin to people with different colored palms than the rest of their skin tone and this is my favorite comment down below there's a few but this one is by far the best local tumblr user accidentally reveals that they have never seen a black person and I personally go as far as to say this person has never seen somebody that isn't completely pale and lacking melanin because I personally have like a little bit of tan and I can see the physical line between the back of my hand and my palm like there's a clear difference there and it's just a little bit more noticeable in people with darker skin this guy is talking about in almost extinct species of rhinos I feel bad back in 2006 I paid big money to travel to Africa with a guide to hunt one of these the horn is still on my wall but I'm gonna take it down now I can't bear to look at it this is a joke right no you didn't stop making stupid northern white rhinos in the wild all four of them had essentially personal bodyguards in 2006 and they were all in Garamba National Park I believe it's also illegal to hunt in the confines of Garamba National Park and the 300 or so manned army that protected it and 46 other endangered species in that park would have turned you into pink mist if you did actually hunt there no you're mistaken I'm a highly decorated military sniper and there used to be five northern white rhinos in the wild I hit a world-record shot from four miles away and then used a teleporter that I invented that the government doesn't want you to know about because we've completely disrupt the shipping and travel industries to teleport the Rhino out of the enclosure into my possession but you tell me who's making up stories when a 50 Cal bullet grazes your scalp but does no harm to you when you're sitting at your desk tonight nothing better than this fire stuff I'm lighting up right now plus five cool-kid points for me that's not weed what is it then lush face mask what he shows the lush face mask why would you do this is it a waste of facemask and nobody thinks you're cool because you smoke weed you idiot a gaming PC price negotiable one thousand dollars still got it for sale yep okay sir / ma'am I hope this is real and not a scam I will like to get this for my cousin doing his master's in zoology / see I'm a member of the United States Marine Corps USMC but I'm no longer in town to meet in person the price is okay with me and I'll be adding an extra 130 for the shipping cost let me know if you are ready and then proceed with the payment through money Graham god bless you sir where would I be shipping it to you would be mailing it to my cousin in West Africa do you know how money Graham works nope but this seems pretty sketchy considering your area code isn't a local area code can't call in school was that a voicemail or you that was a voicemail okay I assure you that this is all real and legit on my end so where are you from MoneyGram is a cash pickup service at the Walmart stores I told you I am currently in Camp Pendleton California oh but you're from this place yeah so I will be making the payment first to you then you mail out the PC to my cousin I gotta be honest with you man this is hitting every red flag in the book for a scam one you're not local to you're trying to use a money wire three it's being sent to Africa which is notorious for scams for your number has been reported on multiple websites for previous scams my number yes how send me a screenshot he sends a picture of his number being marked not safe by a website that checks phone numbers just reported your number to local police department by the way Goodin I don't know if he's trying to say goodnight there or he's just a big fan of drew gooden and he doesn't know how to spell his last name but that messages is just confusing to me okay I am a Marine I will arrest you my brother is in the local police department I will give him your number now so he will come and get you lol well first off Marines can't arrest people second he should arrest you pretending to be a Marine is a crime also I just don't even know what he could possibly arrest this kid selling the laptop for like he's done nothing wrong here other than accusing this person of being a scam which I'm pretty sure is just scepticism not against the law and all so how does this whole MoneyGram thing work like I'm not exactly sure how this scam works I'm guessing this guy was gonna send some proof of him sending the money Graham and then the kid was gonna show up at the Walmart and the money wasn't going to be there after he already shipped it but if somebody has more knowledge about these scams I'd really like to know just for my own personal info I was in Hot Topic once and while searching through the band t-shirts welcome to The Black Parade starts up over the speaker's all it took was one note on the piano to get me to fall to my knees in the middle of the Hot Topic and scream the lyrics funny thing is a bunch of teens and staff started singing with me at the top of their lungs good job MC our fandom we haven't all disappeared and without MC our is how I disappear the funniest thing about this post is this was posted by the original poster on reddit but it was their post on tumblr that they knew was fake but decided to post anyway and they only got one note out of it it's just so sad bro WTF yo I was walking around nude like I do and I had the camera flip the wrong dick pic and then I was like sorry it was an accident and then she was like damn that's okay I wasn't expecting it but it's like pretty big so it's okay sounds made-up what no I'm not even joking this is the biggest flex ever I honestly cannot tell if this is satire just the least self-aware human on the planet one of my law school professors was a notorious drunk and he called on me one day when I was totally unprepared and he was visibly drunk I dead stared at him for a minute then nodded and said and that's it and he thought I had answered and said yes excellent and carried on okay I'm pretty sure if you're sober enough to stand up in front of a class and attempt to teach a course you can sense a minute of silence and even if he was blind and deaf drunk I'm sure he could sense the physical cringe in the air of you not talking for a full minute today I got a detention for standing up for what I believe in teacher write down three things you dislike about yourself me sits there Sierra why aren't you writing I can't do this I will take a zero sorry why because I refuse to promote self hate because some people in the world can fill out 20 of these front and back with no blank spaces and this can trigger someone Ciarra you have to do it or I am sending you to the office Oh gets up and walks to the office okay this just screams BS to me and one of the main reasons I feel that way is I don't think that a teacher would ask kids three things they dislike about themselves like that exact wording I feel like they say like what are three areas you can improve in what are three of your weaknesses they wouldn't be like what are three things you hate about yourself I want to know what you think is wrong with you but I'm not sure it really depends on the class but let me know have you ever had a question near that includes three things that you dislike about yourself okay I just searched my name on Google to try and find an image for the outro and I found this this is Joey's world tour in the top right and me in the top bottom when I made myself have a mustache for a live stream but yeah this is also attached to a fanfiction that I will need to check out after recording this video but follow me on Twitter and Instagram both of them are at used to our videos will be linked in the description down below also follow me on twitch twitch TV slash your Q as in the Q that belongs to you you know I'll be streaming tomorrow night at 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time as usual and both nights after that I stream Monday Wednesday Front know what I don't even know my stream schedule I scream Monday Tuesday Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time every single week so come check that out I'll see you all very soon I hope you're skating on to the best of your abilities I hope you're drinking more water and I will uh I'll see you very soon like I just said bye I just referred to myself as being in the top bottom in this discriminant freaking think that it and me in the top bottom
0,"Between the first Europeans arriving
 in 1492 and the Victorian age, the indigenous population of the New World dropped by at
 least 90%. The cause? Not the conquistadors and company -- they killed
 lots of people but their death count is nothing compared to what they brought with them: small
 pox, typhus, tuberculosis, influenza, bubonic plague, cholera, mumps, measles and more leapt
 from those first explorers to the costal tribes, then onward the microscopic invaders spread
 through a hemisphere of people with no defenses against them. Tens of millions died. These germs decided the fate of these battles
 long before the fighting started. Now ask yourself: why didn't the Europeans get
 sick? If New-Worlders were vulnerable to old-world
 diseases, then surely Old-Worlders would be vulnerable to New World diseases. Yet, there was no Americapox spreading eastward
 infecting Europe and cutting the population from 90 million to 9. Had Americapox existed
 it would have rather dampened European ability for transatlantic expansion. To answer why this didn't happen: we need
 first to distinguish regular diseases -- like the common cold -- from what we'll call plagues. 1. Spread quickly between people. Sneezes spread plagues faster than handshakes
 which are faster than closeness. Plagues use more of this than this. 2. They kill you quickly or you become immune. Catch a plague and you're dead within seven
 to thirty days; survive and you'll never get it again. Your body has learned to fight it.
 You might still carry it -- the plague lives in you, you can still spread it -- but it can't
 hurt you. The surface answer to this question isn't
 that Europeans had better immune systems to fight off New World plagues -- it's that the New
 World didn't have plagues for them to catch. They had regular diseases but there was no
 Americapox to carry. These are history's biggest killers, and they
 all come from the Old World. But why? Let's dig deeper, and talk cholera: a plague
 that spreads if your civilization does a bad job of separating drinking water from pooping
 water. London was terrible at this, making it the cholera capital of the world. Cholera
 can rip through dense neighborhoods, killing swaths of the population before moving onward.
 But that's the key: it has to move on. In a small, isolated group, a plague like
 cholera cannot survive -- it kills all available victims, leaving only the immune and then
 theres nowhere to go -- it's a fire that burns through its fuel. But a city -- shining city on the hill -- to
 which rural migrants flock, where hundreds of babies are born a day: this is sanctuary
 for the fire of plague; fresh kindling comes to it. The plague flares and smolders and
 flares and smolders again -- impossible to extinguish. Historically, in city borders, plagues killed
 faster than people could breed. Cities grew because more people moved to them than died
 inside of them. Cities only started growing from their own population in the 1900s when
 medicine finally left its leaches and bloodletting phase and entered its soap and soup phase, giving humans some tools to slow death. But before that a city was an unintentional
 playground for plagues and a grim machine to sort the immune from the rest. So the deeper answer is that the New World
 didn't have plagues because the New World didn't have big, dense, terribly sanitized
 deeply interconnected cities for plagues to thrive. OK, but The New World wasn't completely barren
 of cities, and tribes weren't completely isolated. Otherwise the newly-arrived smallpox in the
 1400s couldn't have spread. Cities are only part of the puzzle: they're
 required for plagues, but cities don't make the germs that start the plagues -- those
 germs come from the missing piece. Now, most germs don't want to kill you, for
 the same reason you don't want to burn down your house; germs live in you. Chronic diseases
 like leprosy are terrible because they're very good at living in you and not killing you. Plague lethality is an accident, a misunderstanding,
 because the germs that cause them don't know they're in humans; they think
 they're in this. Plagues come from animals. Whooping cough comes from pigs, as does flu,
 as well as from birds. Our friend the cow alone is responsible for measles, tuberculosis,
 and smallpox. For the cow these diseases are no big deal
 -- like colds for us. But when cow germs get in humans, the things they do to make a
 cow a little sick to spread make humans very sick. Deadly sick. Now, germs jumping species like this is extraordinarily
 rare. That's why generations of humans can spend time around animals just fine. Being
 the patient zero of a new animal-to-human plague is winning a terrible lottery. But a colonial-age city raises the odds: there
 used to be animals everywhere; horses, herds of livestock in the streets, open slaughterhouses,
 meat markets pre-refrigeration, and rivers of human and animal excrement running
 through it all. A more perfect environment for diseases to
 jump species could hardly be imagined. So the deeper answer is that plagues come
 from animals, but so rarely that you have to raise the odds with many chances for infection
 and even then the new-born plague needs a fertile environment to grow. The Old World had the necessary pieces
 in abundance. But why was a city like London filled with
 sheep and pigs and cows and Tenochtitlan wasn't? This brings us to the final level, for this
 video anyway. Some animals can be put to human use -- this
 is what domestication means: animals you can breed, not just hunt. Forget for a the moment the modern world: go back
 to 10,000BC when tribes of humans reached just about everywhere. If you were in one
 of these tribes, what local animals could you capture, alive, and successfully pen to breed? Maybe you're in North Dakota and thinking
 about catching a Buffalo: an unpredictable, violent tank on hooves, that can outrun you
 across the planes, leap over your head and travels in herds thousands strong. Oh, and you have no horses to help you -- because
 there are no horses on the continent. Horses live here -- and won't be brought over until
 too late. It's just you, a couple buddies, and stone-based
 tools. American Indians didn't fail to domesticate buffalo because they couldn't figure it out.
 They failed because it's a buffalo. No one could do it -- buffalo would have been amazing
 creatures to put to human work back in BC, but it's not going to happen -- humans have
 only barely domesticated buffalo with all our modern tools. The New World didn't have good animal candidates
 for domestication. Almost everything big enough to be useful is also too dangerous,
 or too agile. Meanwhile the fertile crescent to central
 Europe had cows and pigs and sheep and goats: easy-peasy animals comparatively begging
 to be domesticated. A wild boar is something to contend with if
 you only have stone tools but it's possible to catch and pen and breed and feed to eat
 -- because pigs can't leap to the sky or crush all resistance beneath their hooves. In the New World the only native domestication
 contestant was: llamas. They're better than nothing -- which is probably why the biggest
 cities existed in South America -- but they're no cow. Ever try to manage a heard of llamas
 in the mountains of Peru? Yeah, you can do it, but it's not fun. Nothing but drama, these
 llamas. These might seem, cherry-picked examples,
 because aren't there hundreds of thousands of species of animals? Yes, but when you're
 stuck at the bottom of the tech tree, almost none of them can be domesticated. From the
 dawn of man until this fateful meeting, humans domesticated; maybe a baker's dozen of unique
 species the world over. And even to get that high a number you need to stretch it to include
 honeybees and silkworms; nice to have, but you can't build a civilization on a foundation
 of honey alone. These early tribes weren't smarter, or better
 at domestication. The Old World had more valuable and easy animals. With dogs, herding sheep
 and cattle is easier. Now humans have a buddy to keep an eye on the clothing factory, and
 the milk and cheeseburger machine, and the plow-puller. Now farming is easier, which
 means there's more benefit to staying put, which means more domestication, which means
 more food which means more people and more density and oh look where we're going. Citiesville:
 population: lots; bring your animals; plagues welcome. That is the full answer: The lack of New World
 animals to domesticate limited not only exposure to germs sources but also limited food production,
 which limited population growth, which limited the reverse, and thus a continent full of
 plague and a continent devoid of it. So when ships landed in the New World, there
 was no Americapox to bring back. The game of civilization has nothing to do
 with the players, and everything to do with the map. Access to domesticated animals in
 numbers and diversity is the key resource to bootstrapping a complex society from nothing
 -- and that complexity brings with it, unintentionally, a passive biological weaponry devastating
 to outsiders. Start the game again but move the domesticable
 animals across the sea and history's arrow of disease and death flows in the opposite
 direction. This still does leave one last question. Just
 why are some animals domesticable and others not? Why couldn't American Indians domesticate
 deer? Why can't zebras be domesticated? They look just like horses. And what does it mean
 to tame an animal? To answer that, click here for part 2."
0,by five-year-old Tommy he and his friends play Star Wars at school we separate them into two teams boys and girls except this one goal of my team why she's the boss boys are the workers girls are the boss sooner you learn the better I guess all right we're just gonna ignore the casual sexism okay I just watched a guy who don't go and she totally ignored him I just sang the words of the song

reason to think meant a trash yesterday I attended a conference where the attendance was 98% white men found out later in the night that I won an award I was voted most talented in being beautiful women in science sure that happened I am 100% sure just 350 percent sure what is the coolest thing your mom has ever done that you know of my mom was my college professor in freshman year no one in my

cute for being overweight I accidentally knocked my glass of water on his crotch when I stood up took a drink from his AMD backwashed and said well hey my chubby ass is leaving cuz you're a dick and the table next to us clapped in Germany the government has increased fuel prices in just one hour of time people abandoned their cars in the streets and Avenue was in walked all over a million abandoned cars they had to lower the price when the people are smart the correct can't accomplish their goals all the other kids with the Pumped Up Kicks you better run better run outrun my gun so once my principal in middle school said I was the kind of kid to shoot up a school so I went free the school one day whistling this I got tackled I awkwardly and shamefully told my mom I didn't want to try out that blouse she thought would look good on me because it's too frilly and the whole store turned around and clapped that time I got into the school in a common use a voice changer app to make my voice sound really deep into money and chanted some song tannic message a super religious teacher got so scared she got out of the classroom screaming and the principal put the school in lockdown I was crying in front of the McDonald's near my house eating french fries and listening to some sad playlist of my car and a black guy tapped of my window it just gave me a life-changing advice it's going to be okay little you can do it you may be wondering why I didn't say the N word even though it's not even like the hardy R version because apparently people get triggered when you quote something I wish I was joking you're offended by it quite honestly you're the worst type of person one time I was swimming in a spring at Florida and everyone started screaming and getting out of the water and I was like haha losers ain't nothing in this water so I climbed up onto a rock to sit but then the rock started moving and that's the story at the time I wrote a manatee while working past a gay couple one of the females smiled at me and said although I smiled and said her way back her bull dyke of a girlfriend didn't like that don't talk to that guy she said to her girlfriend her short red we all well see I asked her who were you the boss off she replied her and pointed to a girlfriend her girlfriend didn't like that you're not made bus and they got into an argument and when

0,ass credit doctors have written it what was your dumbest r /i and varus mad patient experience are in here I see some crazy stuff but one thing that stands out was the time I was admitting a guy to the hospital I can't really remember what for but he was about 400 pounds diabetic heart disease you name it anyhow I'm at the computer going over some admission questions with him and his 10 family members who are crowded in the room with him a few minutes and he starts complaining that he's thirsty he needs something to drink right now so I get on my phone and call the nurse assistant and I said to bring in some ice water as soon as the words are out of my mouth the whole family screams n-o-o-o-o no water has allergic to water well this is gonna be a problem turns out the guy had been drinking nothing but sprite and sweet tea for years because of his water allergy the next question the wife had was where are we all supposed to sleep the whole family ten people were planning to stay at he hospital with him you can't make this sharp a related story from my friend a ginika logic oncologist basically a woman had early uterine cancer but refused surgery she wanted to explore alternative treatments like coffee enemas and meditation she somehow managed to get an audience with the Dalai Lama who told her to go back to Western treatment I'm a dental student one patient in particular is pathological liar during one visit they claimed to have gone to medical school next visit was that they did dental army last visit was that they had a PhD the patient will say things like hey Doc do you need me to move my head Mitchell or distil no I need you to move your head right hey Doc are these cavities being caused by the in aerobic pathology microbes no they are caused by you eating snacks all day and not brushing 80 plus year old patient who was declining with multiple diagnoses and about three decubitus ulcers daughter was adamant that her father be kept on his strict Paleo diet because that would supercharge his healing she had a stack of dad he simply wasn't getting enough nutrition to heal the ulcers he didn't like the diet at all by the way at some point you kind of have to stop being polite and just tell patients slash family members bluntly that you don't have time for this Sh in what you recommend and they can do what they want and just document everything it happens a lot but she sticks out all the time I'm a veterinarian and I can't tell you how many clients want to explain to me that their pets illness can be fixed if they are fed her or diet grain-free diet fish oil supplement etc sure whatever come back to me when your dog's huge mammary mass ulcer rapes and starts leaking pus everywhere and we can reevaluate how well her or diet is working to fix that this one happened to my ex-father-in-law and it's funny but it's not he was a surgeon very gentle soft-spoken guy and came out to tell them the bio see results to which they responded praise Jesus it's malignant he had to explain that malignant meant bad er RN here not a physician but you may find this interesting young adult male presence with multiple abscesses on various parts of his body states he injected his boyfriend's semen into himself trying to get pregnant he tells one of the APCs he should have gone with his original plan and tried on his dog first sight clears him he's admitted to the floor and gets IV antibiotics what oh boy it's my time to shine a guy brings his wife to the ER her leg has a 7 X 7 centimeter wound diabetic ulcer with greenish yellow pus and what looked like a few maggots now I took one look at her and referred her to the surgery department for admission but the hubby is adamant on his wife's kidney disease but doc it's just a wound you gotta fix her kidney first doc I read online the diabetes can cause kidney failure and you gotta do something for that I spent an hour convincing him that his wife would probably die before the kidney damage sat in by sepsis from the clearly infected wound optician here we had a patient who refused to let us use the tannot meter a machine for checking ocular internal pressure to diagnose glaucoma he said that puff machine gives you glaucoma and we weren't going to pull that on him he told us his father got an exam and had glaucoma after using that machine his uncle and brother also had no signs of glaucoma and after getting the puffs test both people had been diagnosed with the disease glaucoma doesn't have any outward symptoms before you start going blind this lips just told me he has a very strong familial disposition to glaucoma and refused to be tested for it not a doctor but a patient whose mother was like this the doctor had to speak to me on the site because of it my grandmother has Crohn's disease very very badly it skipped my mother and her brother when I was 15 over the course of six months I went from being 5 feet 9 and 190 pounds to being 110 I was a skeleton extremely an emic and coughing up blood my mother was convinced it was something else I forced her to bring me to a doctor and she spouted off all these possibilities she then talked about what she yahood not even Google Yahoo about genetics and such and kromm's can't skip generations well the doc said just in case we are gonna run some tests long story short I have Crohn's in my throat and small intestine so does my cousin it just skipped a generation I work for an optometrist and it was a month before school started and a woman brought in her son to have his eyes checked for the first time seems like a pretty reasonable thing for any parent even if he was a little older than usual for a first eye exam better late than never I guess the mom was well-spoken and appeared fairly intelligent everything went as normal the doctor examined the boy and ended up prescribing glasses when the doctor was explaining to the mom that a son had to wear his glasses all the time since he's nearsighted and basically can't see clearly past five feet in front of him and will definitely need glasses for school for some reason this cause switch to flip in the moment she's passed out on the doctor saying that her son doesn't need glasses and that the doctor is only saying that he does because he wants to sell glasses she says that she only brought her son in because there was some form for school that needed to be filled out and that doctors are all a con artists trying to push on necessary medications and interventions the doctor tried to calm her down and explained that he's only trying to help them but that she was free to get a second opinion and gave her a copy of the kids prescription and sent them on their way about four months later the lady is back asking for another copy of her son's prescription apparently the first semester midterm results were in and her son failed them all because he couldn't see the board in his classes and needs glasses had a young woman with recurring U T is at began after a recent partner and with no STDs went through the standard questions trying to figure out what could be causing them and eventually found out she had been lubricating with jelly not KY jelly the mix-up had literally been a joke on house it took me some effort to keep the straight face but we eventually resolved the problem and she stopped getting you tears oh I have two good ones that come to mind clinical pharmacist here by the way with one story in the ER and one in the pharmacy ER physician told me this one sixteen-year-old boy presented to the ER with an extremely swollen discolored penis apparently he has been using his mom's insulin needles to draw blood out of his arm and injected into his own penis he thought that adding blood would help increase his size his penis was terribly infected and he was hospitalized for a week or so one day in the pharmacy a girl comes to the counter requesting a refill for her birth control we pulled up her profile and realized we couldn't refill it because she just got a 28-day fill less than two weeks ago when we asked what happened to the other one she said she was out apparently both her and her boyfriend were each taking a pill each and was adamant that was how they needed to prevent pregnancy I've got two stories that stick out in my mind the first is the mother of a toddler who came into when the kid had cried II green slash bloody stuff coming out of his left nostril and a lot of redness and swelling of only the left side of his nose and the adjacent cheek mum was sure he caught a sinus infection and just wanted some antibiotics now I know some kids like shoving whatever will fit into their body orifices and that this was more than likely given the one-sided nature of his condition but mum was insistent that he never puts things in his nose it took some convincing but I finally got her to let me take a look gave a squirt of midazolam in the good nostril to settle him then dug with some tweezers through the crowd until I pulled out a big ol button battery it rolled been burning his nose for a couple of days hopefully he healed up well side note if a kid swallows a button battery it can do a similar thing to their esophagus this is an emergency and needs to be dealt with as soon as possible my dad is an emergency nurse he experiences the same thing doctors in the ER do maybe more so because he's the one in the rooms more often anyway here's a good story from him I had a patient come in with several pages he printed off the internet he kind of slammed them down and said this is what I have he had bloating nausea vomiting diarrhea bloody stool and fever among other things he insisted he had schistosomiasis he was being a real jerk about it like we're wasting time since he already knew what he had so I asked when did he get back from Africa and he said Africa I've never been to Africa what the hell would I be doing in Africa I proceeded to tell him that schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease one gets while swimming in the Nile River or other rivers in developing countries like in Southeast Asia he got angry at me because he thought I was being a smartass he got seen and diagnosed with gastroenteritis the stomach flu the bloody stool he had him avoids you have been visited by the great herb of capitalism many seeds will come your way but only

0,"Although, of course, not every person likes
 to get drunk or high, there’s no doubt that, as a species, we
 do have a bit of a fondness for mind-altering substances. You find them in every human culture that
 has ever existed. And it seems like our feathered and furry
 friends also partake from time to time. You might have read the news about wallabies
 getting high on poppy flowers, or perhaps you’ve watched the hilarious
 video of a New Zealand wood pigeon hanging upside down after eating too much
 fermented fruit. Stoned or tipsy animals - they are internet
 gold, but, as you might expect, most of these cases are anecdotal. In fact, most examples of animals regularly
 seeking out intoxicants kind of fall apart when researchers look closer. Even some of the oldest and most well-known
 examples — like cats on catnip—don’t hold up to scientific
 scrutiny. So let’s take a look at four infamous cases
 and see what science says is really going on. In 2013, the internet went berserk over a
 video showing dolphins apparently getting high by passing around an inflated
 puffer fish and “milking” out its toxins. After a few chews, the dolphins drifted motionless
 at the surface of the water like they were super stoned, or just “fascinated
 by their own reflection,” as one zoologist said. Observations of this weird behavior actually
 go back to 1995, when researchers described it in rough-toothed
 dolphins. But there are a few reasons to think this
 drug-seeking story is a bit… fishy. Like, for example, the main toxin in the fish’s
 arsenal is tetrodotoxin or TTX, and TTX is perhaps the worst choice for a
 party drug ever. It works by binding to sodium channels in
 muscle and nerve cells and immobilizing them. Anything more than a few micrograms of the
 stuff and mammals experience headaches, vomiting, muscle weakness,
 and paralysis. Too much leads to heart or lung failure. There have also been cases of people going
 into a deep coma where they’re still fully conscious but
 can’t move— which is not fun sounding… super terrifying. I don’t like it! The same could be said for a whole bunch of
 recreational drugs— most have toxic effects if taken in high enough
 doses. But milligram for milligram, TTX is more than
 2000 times as deadly as cocaine, so there isn’t a lot of room for error here. Some animals, like garter snakes, soft-shell
 clams, and the pufferfish themselves have developed resistance to the
 compound. But it’s unlikely dolphins have, because
 no mammals appear to be immune to the stuff, and scientists know that dolphins
 can be killed by similar compounds. So a more likely scenario is that the dolphins
 were simply playing with the puffer. A puffed pufferfish is basically an underwater
 beach ball, and dolphins have been known to be playful
 animals. There are other observations of dolphins toying
 with living things— like, there was a pod of dusky dolphins off
 the coast of New Zealand that passed around an octopus in the very same
 way. It’s fun for them - less fun for the octopus. And that zoned-out chilling at the surface
 afterwards? It’s called logging, and it’s what dolphins
 and whales do to rest— like they might do if they were tuckered out
 after a bunch of playing with like an ocean beachball… that’s actually
 a living thing. Even if the logging was toxically-induced,
 there’s no guarantee the animals were enjoying the experience or
 desired to repeat it. They might have been chilling at the surface
 because they were not, like, feeling good. So although it is possible dolphins are doing
 their own version of the puff, puff, pass, there is not any empirical
 evidence. And a lot of reasons to think that it’s
 not what’s happening. Tales of drunken elephants go back to 1839
 when a naturalist reported that Zulu guides told him they’d seen elephants
 get all weird and aggressive after eating fruit from the marula tree. The naturalist figured the fruit had spent
 too long on the ground and had fermented. And it was pretty clear to him that the elephants
 ate this alcoholic fruit because they, like us, enjoy getting tipsy—it
 just so happens they’re pretty mean drunks. These stories are still told today. But it turns out they are just tall tales. It’s true that elephants have a pretty varied
 diet which includes leaves, grasses, tree bark, and fruit. That fruit includes marula fruits, which will
 ferment if they fall and aren’t eaten. And these fruits can sometimes become an elephant’s
 favorite food. They’re a good source of carbohydrates,
 and there are lots of them around in the dormant season, when trees have shed
 their leaves and high-quality calorie sources are scarce. But, there are a couple of reasons this whole
 drunken elephant story doesn’t hold up--and they were outlined
 in a 2006 paper in the journal Physiological and Biochemical
 Zoology. First of all, elephants usually go for the
 ripe fruit on a tree’s branches, not the fermenting, alcoholic fruit lying
 on the ground. But most importantly, the math does not add
 up. Fermented fruits don’t contain a ton of
 alcohol. Assuming the fruit contained around 3 percent
 alcohol —which would be like a really weak beer-— an elephant would have to eat 4 times its
 maximum daily amount of fruit to get drunk. Being generous, we might try the calculations
 saying the fruits get up to 7% alcohol, because that’s the maximum percentage of
 alcohol captive elephants willingly drink. Apparently we’ve done that study. But even then, there’s no way an elephant
 could eat enough fruit to get the 27 liters of giggle juice it would need
 to become tipsy. Elephants are very big! So, I’m sorry, these giants are not using
 marula fruit as their night cap. And the overlap between their strange behavior
 and the fruiting season probably has a lot more of a straightforward
 answer. The elephants could be acting aggressively
 because they don’t want some lanky apes stealing their prized marula
 fruit. If you’ve ever really watched cows—especially
 around here in Montana, or in several other western US states—you
 might have noticed they sometimes just look a little… out of
 it. Like, they just stare off into space, their
 head drooping, or they’re staggering around like they’re
 on something. Well, it’s possible they’ve been hitting
 the locoweed. That’s the common name for the poisonous
 plants from the legume genuses Astragalus and Oxytropis that
 produce the chemical swainsonine. Swainsonine is a toxin that acts by inhibiting
 enzymes inside of cells which normally break down
 other molecules. When those enzymes are inhibited, the molecules
 build up, and that can have some pretty nasty effects. The animals stop eating and waste away, become
 less fertile, miscarry or have babies that are malformed,
 or die of heart failure. And because cows and other livestock eat these
 plants despite all those negative effects, some have
 suggested they’ve become addicted. But scientists have figured out that idea
 is also loco. For example, a study from 1987 published in
 the Journal of Range Management showed that cows born and raised on a paddock
 containing locoweed eat similar amounts of the plant as newly
 introduced cows. So experienced cows—ones that could possibly
 be addicted— don’t tend to eat any more than the cows
 that have never seen the stuff. And, in a 1991 study on sheep, ewes that were
 loco-ed in the past didn’t seek out the plant a year later when
 they were given an area with lots of room and different plants to
 graze on. What’s probably happening instead is that
 these livestock animals are munching on locoweed when there are few
 other plants available. Locoweed species grow early in the spring
 before other plants and regrow in the fall, after many plants
 have died back. Some varieties of locoweed actually taste
 pretty gross to cows, but if there’s not much else to eat, they’re
 kind of forced to go for it. And scientists think they may get used to
 the taste. Then, they can pass this habit on to others. In a 1994 study, cows that hadn’t seen locoweed
 before increased how much they ate of it after spending time
 around cows that had been trained to eat it. So, in this case, it’s not a drug habit
 - it’s just a “eat whatever you can get your mouth on
 and also what everyone else is eating” habit. Which is the same thing I have. Now it’s no secret that cats go bonkers
 for catnip— hence the perpetual market for catnip toys,
 sprays and treats. And way back in 1962, researchers at Harvard
 described what they called the catnip response: that
 characteristic 10-ish minute reaction where the cat goes from sniffing and licking
 to rubbing their face in the stuff and rolling around and looking cute and all
 whacked out. Later, some scientists went on to conclude
 that cats were experiencing hallucinations, like seeing butterflies, and even likened
 catnip’s effects to how people respond to LSD or marijuana. And from a chemical point of view, catnip
 could make sense as a feline party drug. The active ingredients in catnip and other
 cat-attracting plants— molecules like nepetalactone or actinidine—might
 turn on some of the same brain pathways that many hallucinogens do. So it might seem like cats are a definitive
 case of drug-seeking behavior. But... No one has actually shown that catnip makes
 cats hallucinate. That’s just how a few scientists interpreted
 some pretty standard pawing or rolling behavior. It’s not like they asked a cat to sit nicely
 in an MRI machine for a brain scan or gotten them to paint their weird trips. And the reactions to catnip are all behaviors
 the animals naturally do in a sexual context. Like, all that rubbing and rolling over is
 how cats tell other cats that, like, they’re into them. In fact, scientists have gotten cats to perform
 the same behaviors by exposing them to extracts of male cat urine. So it seems like those catnip compounds are
 chemically similar to feline social odors —enough so to fool cats’ noses, at least. And that would mean all that licking and rubbing
 is them reacting to what seems like the sudden, strong scent
 of another cat— with no visual dazzle or “high” feelings
 involved. If it is a case of olfactory overlap, that
 could explain why only two-thirds to three-quarters of cats seem
 to care much about catnip. It’s long been thought that some cats are
 just immune to the stuff. But research in 2017 says that’s not true—it’s
 just that some cats don’t react as overtly. Instead, they just kind of chill out in a
 sphinx-like posture, which may be because they aren’t interested
 in the smell of a potential mate, or are too young for that kind of thing. But, when you get right down to it, cats and
 catnip isn’t a great example of animal drug-seeking behavior because they
 don’t seek it. Researchers say it’s unlikely that wild
 cats self-administer the stuff. If they did, you might expect there to be
 more wild cats hanging around areas where catnip naturally grows. Basically, if they really needed a hit, they
 wouldn’t mind traveling a bit to get it. But that’s not the case. There’s no correlation between where cat-attracting
 plants grow and where wild cats are found. So, although most cats respond to catnip,
 their relationship to it isn’t the same as humans and mind-altering drugs. There are lots of other potential cases of
 animal drug use which could be explored. But so far, scientists haven’t really found
 any evidence that wild animals seek out chemical highs. And that raises the question of why humans
 definitely do. But to answer that, we have to dig deeper
 into how our closest relatives and model organisms interact with mind-altering
 substances. And that is an episode for another day. Thanks for watching! If you want to learn more about how other
 animals interact with drugs, let me recommend our episode breaking down

0,"In the summer of 1976, a mysterious epidemic
 suddenly struck two central African towns, killing the majority of its victims. Medical researchers suspected the deadly Marburg virus 
 to be the culprit. But what they saw in microscope images
 was an entirely new pathogen, which would be named
 after the nearby Ebola river. Like yellow fever or dengue, the disease caused by the Ebola virus
 is a severe type of hemorrhagic fever. It begins by attacking 
 the immune system's cells and neutralizing its responses, allowing the virus to proliferate. Starting anywhere from two to twenty days
 after contraction, initial symptoms like high temperature, aching, and sore throat resemble those of a typical flu, but quickly escalate to vomiting, rashes, and diarrhea. And as the virus spreads, it invades the lymph nodes 
 and vital organs, such as kidneys and liver,
 causing them to lose function. But the virus itself 
 is not what kills Ebola victims. Instead, the mounting cell deaths 
 trigger an immune system overload, known as a cytokine storm, an explosion of immune responses
 that damages blood vessels, causing both internal and external bleeding. The excessive fluid loss 
 and resulting complications can be fatal within six to sixteen days
 of the first symptoms, though proper care and rehydration therapy can significantly reduce 
 mortality rates in patients. Fortunately, 
 while Ebola is highly virulent, several factors limit its contagiousness. Unlike viruses that proliferate through
 small, airborne particles, Ebola only exists in bodily fluids, such as saliva, blood, mucus, vomit, or feces. In order to spread, these must be transmitted from 
 an infected person into another's body through passageways such as the eyes,
 mouth, or nose. And because the disease's severity increases directly along 
 with the viral load, even an infected person 
 is unlikely to be contagious until they have begun to show symptoms. While Ebola has been shown 
 to survive on surfaces for several hours, and transmission through sneezing
 or coughing is theoretically possible, virtually all known cases of contraction
 have been through direct contact with the severely ill, with the greatest risk 
 posed to medical workers and friends or relatives of the victims. This is why,
 despite its horrifying effects, Ebola has been far less deadly overall
 than more common infections, such as measles, malaria, or even influenza. Once an outbreak has been contained, the virus does not exist 
 in the human population until the next outbreak begins. But while this is undoubtedly a good thing, it also makes Ebola difficult to study. Scientists believe fruit bats 
 to be its natural carriers, but just how it is transmitted to humans
 remains unknown. Furthermore, many of the countries 
 where Ebola outbreaks occur suffer from poor infrastructure and sanitation, which enables the disease to spread. And the poverty of these regions, combined with the relatively low amount
 of overall cases means there is little economic incentive
 for drug companies to invest in research. Though some experimental medicines
 have shown promise, and governments are funding development
 of a vaccine, as of 2014, the only widespread and effective 
 solutions to an Ebola outbreak remain isolation, sanitation, and information."

 to this than this. That’s because coffee, bread, cheese, beer
 – even chocolate! – are home to millions of microbes. In fact, these foods only acquire the tastes,
 smells, and textures we love because of tiny bacteria and fungi. The vast majority of microbes – about 99%
 – are actually quite harmless to humans. But the other 1% are nasty enough that our
 ancestors – and the ancestors of various other mammals and birds – evolved a natural
 repulsion to stuff that might harbor nasty germs. In general, we think rotten stuff looks and
 smells disgusting, which, considering what's at stake, isn’t overly cautious. Fortunately, if friendly microbes get to our
 food first, they can keep the bad guys at bay. Meat left out on the counter provides the
 perfect conditions for pathogens to flourish: it’s warm, moist, and protein-rich, just
 like our bodies. But with some micromanagement – adding lots
 of salt, for instance – we can help harmless, salt-tolerant microbes like Lactobacillus
 outcompete their dangerous but salt-sensitive relatives. A few unrefrigerated months later, we get
 salami, rather than Salmonelli! Our ancestors stumbled on this kind of controlled
 spoilage thousands of years ago – either by lucky accidents or out of serious desperation
 – and we humans have been intentionally spoiling food ever since. Not only to keep our food safe to eat, but
 also because the microbes we culture can transform it, almost magically, into awesome deliciousness. Yeast, for example, gorge on the sugary starch
 in bread dough, then burp out carbon dioxide that helps give loaves their lift. In a more exotic transformation, bacteria
 and fungi take turns munching on piles of cacao, mellowing out bitter polyphenols and
 helping create the complex and delicious taste of chocolate. And deep in cheese caves, mold spores populate
 small holes and cracks in soon-to-be blue cheese, while their relatives munch through
 the rest of the blob, digesting big protein and fat molecules into a host of smaller aromatic
 and flavor compounds, that give the final product its smoothness and rich, funky flavor. But to some, stinky cheese is about as appetizing
 as licking someone’s toes. Which isn’t that far off, since the bacteria
 that make some cheeses super-stinky are the same ones that cause foot odor. Yum? Even so, these flavors tend to grow on us:
 not just literally but also figuratively. The more we’re exposed to particular microbial
 funks – from our first taste of the flavor compounds in amniotic fluid forward – the
 more we tend to like them. As a result, people around the world have
 some very different ideas about how to microbe-ify foods – but every culinary culture involves
 fermentation in one way or another. And if we didn’t let food spoil just a little
 bit, we’d have no sauerkraut, soy sauce, pickles, or prosciutto. Not to mention kefir, kimchi, kombucha, koumiss,
 katsuobushi - and plenty of other delicacies that don’t start with K. What’s more,
 spoiled food may well have changed far more than our tastes – historical evidence suggests
 that, when our ancestors gave up their wandering ways and settled down to grow grain, it was
 likely for love of either bread or beer. Whatever the case, one thing is clear: without
 the help of friendly fermenting microbes, we humans would  be terribly uncultured."

eyes full hearts we are all lucky that Kyle Chandler is not a Scientologist or I would be broke and married to Mimi Rogers right now that's a fact that's a true fact but look tonight we're not gonna talk about the players on the field we're gonna talk about the fields themselves stadiums America has a lot of them and they are increasingly fantastic at the home of the Dallas Cowboys here's what you also get real art by world-renowned artists the party suite is all about watching the game or concert in style you can do bottle service you can set up come in before the game you know you get the snakeskin you know that had the gold aged so everybody knows where you're sitting there are 14 party cabanas and two pools watched by lifeguards that looked out on the field just look toward the end zone yep those swimming pools are inside the stadium that's right you can now watch a game from a swimming pool suspended above the field where the real contest for the fans is finding out whether or not HPV can swim Hey my money's on HPV that's a clutch STD that's clutch most new stadiums nowadays look like they were designed by a coked-up Willy Wonka and if you don't believe me just look at what the Miami Marlins have in their new ballpark that's a fish tank around the hole part that is awesome yes the Marlins have actual aquariums behind home plate which is indeed awesome because you get to watch baseball while at the same time watching fish develop panic disorders all those new finches are clearly incredible the problem is they're also expensive and the vast majority of stadiums are built using public money one analysis found that between 2000 and 2010 we spent 12 billion dollars building new facilities for professional teams which begs the question why sports teams are successful businesses with wealthy owners and yet they still get our help two years ago Detroit got approval to spend more than 280 million dollars in taxpayer money on a new arena project for the Red Wings just six days after the city filed for bankruptcy even though the Red Wings owner is Mike Ilitch the founder of the Little Caesars pizza chain who's worth an estimated 5.1 billion that's a little hard to swallow I mean sure not as hard to swallow as a little Caesars crazy breads with an assortment of Caesar dips but still pretty hard and we don't just help teams build stadiums we let them keep virtually all the revenue those stadiums then produce just listen to the president of the Miami Marlins described they're not at all unusual deal you get the income from naming rights yes you get the income from concessions yes you get the luxury box income yes you get the income from non-baseball events that's the whole object of this is to get more revenue wow that's that's pretty direct hey you think I've got into this because I like sports what are you a child who let a child host a television show this is all about the money son that money he mentioned naming rights in there and it is true for most teams if you sell the name of your building you get to keep the money even when it's as stupid as this the New Orleans pelicans are going to be playing their home games at the Smoothie King Center yeah the Smoothie King Center and you have to feel a bit for the pelicans players it can't be easy to protect your home court when it's named after a slop of yogurt and kale ejaculated from a blender but owners monetizing every part of a stadium is so ingrained it's even now a feature in the Madden NFL video game we're adding the ability to run your team as an NFL owner being an owner isn't just about talking though it's about taking action set prices on concessions merchandising tickets upgrade your state improve everything from the parking lot to the locker room it's incredible the owner experience is apparently so realistic that if you unlock a secret level you can even deal with the aftermath of making a racist comment that's that's incredible attention to detail gamer's teams teams are so successful at pushing for upgraded stadiums that since the early 90s we've had a replacement rate of over 90% we replace stadiums even faster than we replace spider-men and come on what Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were perfectly good state of the art spider-man almost every single team gets some kind of public money some like the Yankees might build the stadium themselves but on lands that they're given rent and property tax free costing New York City hundreds of millions in lost revenues but many others get their stadiums funded through tax-exempt municipal bonds which yes sound like the last words an accountant says before his blind date falls asleep at the dinner table but but they're actually incredibly important so so let me quickly try to explain municipal bonds are a way for the city to take out a loan which they then later repay with interest although usually through new or existing taxes they're supposed to be for things like roads or schools or public goods that private industry would not pay for but they've been routinely misused to finance stadiums for decades and often cities do it because teams claim they can't afford to build stadiums themselves the Marlins got nearly 500 million dollars toward their fish traumatising theme park by pleading poverty although when miami-dade county tried to verify that something strange happened among the questions they asked was can we see your books you said no right why didn't you just open the books because isn't that easier because in Major League Baseball history books are just kept private that's just how it is sure but if the argument in major league baseball history that's just how it is always won we'd still have an all-white league of players gambling on games smoking cigarettes at the plate and dying of syphilis but then leaked documents later revealed that despite denying they made a profit the Marling's had generated nearly 50 million over the previous two years and listen pretending you're poor is wrong it wasn't okay when mary-kate Olsen went through her hobo phase and it's not okay now and we haven't even mentioned the ultimate bargaining chip the teams like to use threatening to leave right now the Oakland Raiders the st. Louis Rams and the San Diego Chargers are all threatened to move to Los Angeles unless they get new stadiums in fact over the past two decades nearly half the NFL has been subject to speculation about a move to LA it's such a cliche that in the current map and video game if you want a new stadium a good way to do that is to relocate the team and the game even tells you the easiest choice financially is guess where lots Angeles and if you're a Chargers fan that must be pretty infuriating oh come on even my make-believe escapist entertainment he's trying to move my  team to LA in fact Chargers fans are currently so terrified their team might leave not only are they campaigning to spend public money on a stadium they're doing it in one of the worst rap songs of all time die horribly

ran an ad showing a player visiting a child in hospital with cancer and the tagline if the twins leave Minnesota an eight year old from Willmar undergoing chemotherapy will never get a visit from Marty Cordova which is less like the make-a-wish Foundation and more like the maker threats foundation but teams don't just use threats to get what they want they also promised that new stadiums can work economic magic the Milwaukee Bucks who are also currently threatening to leave if they don't get a new arena or running this ad now the ripple effect starts this is Wisconsin's home from the court to concerts and opportunity the ripple effect of a new era begins today it spreads across the river village up through Roseville and across the great state of Wisconsin settle down reel walking box for a start I don't think Wisconsin will be transformed by one new arena and also if you really are looking to make a tangible change how about coming up with a better slogan than fear the deer deers aren't scary they're timid forest ponies with sticks on their heads I fear no deer the truth is stadiums very rarely revitalized their surrounding areas all create large numbers of permanent jobs just listen to one bar owner near that new Marlins ballpark he says since the stadium opened in 2012 not only of his profits not risen on game days his regular stay away afraid of the traffic here is a business owner we don't see any changes I could even say it's hurting us of course it is because no one has ever said hey let's go hang out in the area around the stadium and I'll tell you why I've got a new shirt and I really want someone to vomit Miller Lite and nachos all over it in fact a major review of almost 20 years of studies showed economists could find no substantial evidence that stadiums had increased jobs incomes or tax revenues or to put that another way this one economist said to me I love this line he said your rather than spend a billion dollars on a stadium you're actually better off flying a plane over a city and dumping a billion dollars on the populace and just letting them pick up the money and spend it to be fair that is not a great idea for the economy but is a fantastic idea for a new reality show tune in this Sunday for Ryan Seacrest's billion dollar job only on NBC and it gets one step worse because when you use public money to pay for an expensive stadium you might find yourself unable to afford something you badly need Hamilton County in Ohio was estimated to spend 15 million last year on debts and other costs for the Bengals and the red stadiums even though since building them they've had to sell a public hospital cut 1,700 jobs and delay payments for schools because of budget gaps and it might not even end there because there's a clause in the contract that states if 14 other NFL stadiums have something then taxpayers must buy the bengals that thing and here is how comprehensive that clause is taxpayers are also on the hook for all kinds of future bells and whistles some that haven't even been invented yet at some point taxpayers are have also agreed to pay for a holograph replay machine someday it's true the Bengals have a deal whereby if someone invents holographic instant replay in the future the county has to buy it for them and that's the kind of clause owners put into a deal in order to take it out during negotiations which begs the question what else was in there look we want a helipad a submarine dock and a monkey named professor bananas to hang out in the locker enjoying halftime or we're moving the team to LA but teams get these deals because they know politicians will capitulate and give them whatever they want remember Milwaukee what just Monday just this Monday their mayor argued for a new stadium deal he admits is not perfect with this appeal to civic pride I was in China 10 years ago I was on the Great Wall of China and I had a Milwaukee t-shirt on and I'm the Great Wall of China this guy Chinese guy came up to me said Milwaukee Bucks that's a to me it's important to all of us okay okay the only possible way that story is true is if that Chinese man happened to be former Milwaukee Bucks player is Zhang Liang rather Lee Milwaukee Bucks two seasons by average eight point six points again and you could almost sympathize because when politicians do try to stand up to teams it can cost them last month the City Council of Glendale Arizona voted to try and get out of an awful deal with the Coyotes whose hockey arena was costing them more than eight million dollars per year the mayor held a public hearing and it did not go well I support this team it's you that doesn't support any sport in the city not football and certainly not hockey what you're doing is childish it's pathetic and it's just disrespectful what well I can see her passion is real you don't get to call someone childish when you are the one arguing for spending millions of public dollars you don't have to keep a giant slab of ice in Arizona just days after that coyotes fans raised money so that she could tase the mayor for charity taser taser taser okay okay okay first of all do you have to say taser three times before tasing someone you're not tasing beetlejuice and second no one should want to stadium so badly they're willing to electrocute an old man for it and look I know sports can make people behave irrationally for instance some where there is a man with this actual tattoo of Tim Tebow as a center that makes no sense but but we have to come to our senses and stop signing these deals and if you think it will John there's no way it's just too hard let me persuade you to fight back in the only way that I know works an inspirational halftime speech set to music please American sports fans I really need you to join me in the locker room it turns out to have ourselves a talk an emotional inspiring talk so gather round and at home you might want to take a knee I know things look bad out there these owners have been humiliating us for decades I'm sure we could just give up we could roll over and let them do it to us for another 20 years we could do that or right here tonight we could decide to fight back mmm and I'm not saying we shouldn't have giant aquariums in ballparks full of terrified fish of course we should this is America if we don't have them no one else will but we should not be using public money to pay for them and yeah teams might threaten to leave you that might happen but I happen to believe that your cities are more than just the teams who happen to play their st. Louis stand up stand up st. Louis and look at me you're more than just the ramps you're more than just the ramps you're a proud Midwestern metropolis your home of the st. Louis Arch San Diego you're the second largest city in California that's not nothing that's not nothing that's a solid number two and you Cincinnati you're the home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that's Cleveland whether you hear that you're the hometown of astronaut Jim Lovell and Emmy award-winning actress Carol Kane that's Cleveland as well I'm sorry you might have to hang on to the Bengals but for the rest of you for the rest of you I want you to look deep down inside your heart I want you to dig in there and I want you to find something and it's gonna seem tiny but it's the most powerful thing in the world and it's the word anymore so when a billionaire asked you to buy him a hologram machine that doesn't exist yet what are you gonna say that's right and when when they ask you for public money without opening their books what are you gonna say to him that's right and when they ask you if they can keep all the money for calling their arenas Smoothie King Center what are you gonna say to them no that's right because that's a stupid name for anything even a smoothie store so listen to me because I want you all to get out there and the next time a team comes around asking for a new stadium I want you to make them pay what are you gonna do Starro that you"
0,"On February 4th of 2015, Conan O'Brien told a joke: — Tom Brady says he wants to give the truck
 he was given as the Super Bowl MVP— they gave him a truck— he wants to give it to the guy who won
 the Super Bowl for the Patriots I think it's very nice, yeah. I think that's nice! I do. Yeah, so uh... Brady's giving his truck to Seahawks coach Pete Carroll. — The day before, Robert Alex Kaseberg tweeted this joke. The same thing happened again: — Yesterday, surveyors announced
 that the Washington Monument is 10 inches shorter than what's been recorded. Yeah. Of, course the monument is blaming
 the shrinkage on the cold weather. It's a penis joke. — And again: — Some cities that have streets
 named after Bruce Jenner are trying to change
 the streets' names to Caitlyn Jenner. Yeah. And if you live on Bruce Jenner Cul-de-Sac, it will now be called a ""Cul-de-No-Sack."" — The coincidence and timing was enough
 for Kaseberg to sue O'Brien and Time Warner, which owns HBO, for joke theft, alleging damages of at least $600,000. The case is still open, and could go to trial soon. Kaseberg denied our interview request, and O'Brien's team maintains they wrote the bits. Comedian Patton Oswalt is
 an expert witness for the defense in the case, and he can't address it directly. But he explained the challenge
 of claiming ownership over a joke. — You've accidentally stolen a joke. — When I was starting off, I was still an open-micer in D.C. and I was terrible. I said, ""If you wanna make sure that you can
 sit alone on the bus when you're in your seat,"" ""and someone says, 'Hey is this seat taken?' and you go, ""Oh no, no one's sitting there... except the Lord,' ""and then they'll leave."" Now, that's a Carol Leifer joke, it's a great joke and I came off and my friend, Blaine Capatch, said, ""Hey dude, that's a..."" and he wasn't even being mean he was like, ""It's Carol Leifer joke, dude.
 I don't think you realized you did it."" and then I realized, oh my God, it was, I'd seen her do it on one of these 9,000
 stand-up shows that were on TV at the time but it's a difference between the people that, every now and then you
 accidentally throw a line out there, and go, ""Oh geez, that's not mine,"" or the people that they throw
 a line out there and it gets laughs and they go, ""Meh, fine. Let it pass. I'm getting money."" — How do you claim ownership over a joke? — People that have been doing comedy,
 even with for a year, understand without it having
 to be spelled out on an algorithm what ownership of a joke means— we understand who came up
 with the idea, who ran with it. I guess it is hard to understand for some people that comedians come up with jokes from nothing, there's no books, there are no spreadsheets of ideas, there's no workbook we can fill out to get a joke, we we create jokes from nothing, right? — With a comedian, why is it that, as an audience, if somebody steals a joke, and even if it's blatant, and there's evidence, I think most people think, ""Eh, it's still funny""? — The idea of of a mass audience not caring where the joke comes from or who wrote it is still a hangover from the '80s comedy scene
 of the the generic brick wall, comedy shows where people went out
 not to see specific comedians, they went out to see comedy. — Period. — Period. — It sounds like there's a line somewhere for you, but... it's gray. — If you're a comedian, you know when something's been stolen, when something is not right, when clearly someone is doing something that is just not theirs. — Does comedy need a landmark lawsuit case in order to stop jokes jokes stealing? Does that need to happen for comedy? — I don't think that there's going
 to be some kind of landmark case, for lack of a better term, that will ever completely stop joke stealing, but it will I think the best that can happen immediately is the environment for a joke stealer
 could just be very, very, unpleasant."

0,"robocalls Tydfil most annoying type of phone call with every other type of phone call robo calls are clearly infuriating every one of us has answered our phone at some point to hear this hi this is Josh from the customer service department can you hear me okay free medical alert system is a non-bailable arrest warrant issued under your name the reason of this call is to inform you that the IRS is filing lawsuits against you it was the pause in that last one that made it a real cliffhanger I mean you basically knew where it was going but there was a tantalizing chance that they were calling people to inform them that the IRS was filing lawsuit against Nicolas Cage which you're you assume is always true but call to confirm every now and then would be nice the point is everybody is annoyed by robo calls hatred of them might be the only thing that everyone in America agrees on now and if you've been feeling like you've been getting more of them recently you're actually right robo calls increased by 57% in 2018 to nearly 50 billion calls and it's understandably pissing people off the plague of robo calls is getting worse they're the number one consumer complaint to the Federal Communications Commission which receives more than 200,000 protests a year robo calls make up roughly 60% of all complaints to the FCC 60% of all complaints to the FCC are about robo calls so they are definitely aware of the problem it's like the actual tea salon in Vancouver called Netherland but at this point they definitely know they have a real issue the only question is what the are they going to do about it the nuisance of robo calls has gotten to the point where even local news reports about them get interrupted yeah we can't even get through an interview without an unwanted phone call I'm getting a robo call right now as we're talking as I was preparing this report I got one it is just not often that a news report gets interrupted by the subject of that report is your teenager getting involved in a strange new sex trend it's watermelon II and it involves god damn it can you not do this somewhere else so tonight tonight let's look at why robo calls are on the rise and what can be done about them and let's start with a basic definition robo calls are any call where you hear a recording or a robot voice or when a machine automatically dialed your number even if there is a real person on the other end and while a small percentage of robo calls may be useful cause about things like school closings or prescription reminders the vast majority of them vary from the irritating to the outright illegal and you might be surprised to know how many major companies are involved in this a list of top Robo callers includes Capital One Comcast and Wells Fargo all of whom use robo calls to chase debts and sometimes they do that a lot as this woman can testify librelucha wad never suspected one late mortgage payment would trigger what she considers an avalanche of harassment it came and I just blew me away lease attorney say they've logged more than six thousand calls from Wells Fargo to their client over the last four years some days such as in January lease says Wells Fargo rang her more than 20 times a day that's absolutely ridiculous because what is the point of calling someone 20 times a day to collect a debt oh this is actually great timing because while I couldn't pay you 45 minutes ago a small propeller plane full of um laundered drug money just crashed into my dam thanks so much for the call you ravenous ghouls but as you undoubtedly know it is not just major companies who do this phone calls are now so cheap and the technology is so widely available that just about anyone has the ability to place a massive number of calls you created a program here in your life yeah that's right you're gonna hit a button and right about now the calls should start hitting all at once this isn't saying they're all ringing yeah okay that's both very impressive and when you really think about it not actually that's impressive at all it's basically the phone electric from the world's least amusing birthday magician tada wait nothing well guess what the great laptop Dini got paid in advance so all of you and if you're thinking hold on what about the Do Not Call list well it still exists and very occasionally a big company like Dish Network will get fined millions for violating it the problem is though it only applies to one particular kind of call sales calls and the list doesn't physically block companies from calling you it's just something they're supposed to check before doing so and scammers generally ignore it first because they're scammers and second because it's now easy to conceal their identity with something called spoofing and I'll let senator Susan Collins show you how it works in the most Awkward possible way my screen is reading Internal Revenue Service well let's see hello this is Susan Collins may I ask who is calling hello chairman Collins this is Sam Dewey from your staff are you calling from the IRS no senator I'm actually over here cool you know spoofing is actually the perfect technology for Susan Collins to be demonstrating just think about it it's all about temporarily pretending to be one thing and then disappointing everyone when you reveal who you actually are but but despite sounding like urban dictionary slang for when magician's shoot heroin spoofing is undeniably effective robot callers can pretend to be calling from your area increasing the chance that you will pick up and individual scammers can even pretend to be someone that you know as one reporter found out cybersecurity expert Jim Stickley sets up his phone to call my mom posing as me hey mom real quick I need your social security number I thought some beneficiary forms can you help me out real quick I've never there's beneficiary form I just need to fill it out what's your cell says kid number real fast great thanks a lot mom love you how's it I've got a social security number holy literally everything about that was upsetting from the fact that Jeff Rossen had someone scam his own mother to the fact that she fell for it to his amazing reaction when he realizes that his mother did something stupid do these bold choice to broadcast his own mother stupidity on national television to the fact that this man just took told another man's mother that he loves her too the revelation that he feeds Jeff Rossen sounds like a middle-aged man squeezing his own balls - the fact that Jeff Rossen could really use a new shirt the point is there's a lot happening in that clip and none of it is good also also a quick side note on that his mother's social security number wasn't bleeps to protect her identity it had to be centered because her social security number is -  - taint juice ship tits it was no choice it wasn't her choice blame the Social Security Administration and thanks to all these new tactics the onslaught in scam phone calls is huge and it's only getting worse next year some estimates predict half of all mobile calls will be scam calls Wow and that is a real problem for consumers because you have to use your phone we can't go back to the days where everyone would just shout their message into a jar and then mail that jar across the country that was a terrible system and it was only marginally more accurate than having AT&T now oh you like that business daddy Johnny's acting up again Chinese acting up oh I've been I'm gonna get some spicy jars in the mail about that so the point is what can we do about this well on a personal level you can tell individual companies you do business with not to call you by law they're actually not allowed to robocall your cell without consent but that is where this gets tricky because those user agreements that you agreed to you know the ones that no one has ever read they often give companies consent to robocall you and can make revoking it incredibly difficult for instance if you're a customer of credit one bank and you want them to stop robocalling yourself just take out your User Agreement and turn to page four section 19 see where you'll find that you have to physically mail them written notice featuring your name mailing address and the last four digits of your account number two this P o box in Nevada and it makes total sense what you had opted not to do that I would rather receive a thousand phone calls a day every day for the rest of my life then go out and buy a stamp I mean  would I even do that do I have to go to a post office or gonna just go to a Walgreens and if I can go to Walgreens is it all the Walgreens is or just some and if it's just some how do I find out which ones call literally call a place of business with my telephone and ask them if they could sell me a stamp okay then what I have to physically walk to the Walgreens literally physically walk like with my legs and wait in line and buy the stamp wat now put it in a mailbox what the am I gonna find that mailbox the only mailboxes I ever see are those we had boarded up green ones what's the  are those things by the way they're spooky that's what they are it looks like a memorial of a pass mailbox that died in a war now I have to find the one mailbox in New York City that hasn't sacrificed its life in this country pry open its big hungry male mouth and shove a stamped envelope down its dusty throat none of that's gonna happen I'd rather die than engage in that nonsense and deep down I think you know that so so it is no wonder that some people choose to simply mess with robocallers as one journalist did when he noticed the person on the other end sounded a bit suspicious well I'm calling about an online request you once made about health insurance coverage okay with all major companies incomparable hey are you a robot what will you tell me you're not a robot just say I'm not a robot please I am a real person I mean I believe you but will you just say I'm not a robot it'll make me feel better to hear you say if you could say the words I'm not a robot it would really mean a lot to me I am a real person can you hear me okay right but will you say I'm not a robot that man is dead now she killed him she stole his skin she walks among us and she'll kill again well as far as that is experts advise you not to engage with robocalls at all don't pick up and don't talk if you do answer because that lets them know that yours is a live number and you'll just get robo calls more but the much bigger point here is it should not entirely be up to us to deal with this the FCC has the authority to police robo calls and a few years back they actually put some guardrails in place with a set of rules designed to limit them as the FCC's former chair explained at the time they they basically followed a simple principle the consumer needs to be the one who's in charge the consumer needs to give consent that they want to be called or if they are called and haven't given consent to remove that consent by saying don't call me anymore or by calling their phone company and saying I don't want to get these calls and that sounds completely reasonable but unfortunately those rules were then struck down after a trade group sued at which point robo calls increased significantly so we made real progress toward addressing a problem but then we blew it we basically got our one year sobriety chip then celebrated by drinking a gallon of Captain Morgan which is not to say that there aren't things that the FCC could do unfortunately their current chair is this guy at G PI you've probably seen him on this show before alongside his stupid mark and by the way Cheers cheers for you pi says a lot of the right things about this he said that robo calls are the scourge of civilization and he's had a little too much fun showing how dedicated he is to tackling this issue to borrow from former President Kennedy let every robot caller know whether it wishes us well or ill and we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any solution and oppose any but to assure the survival and the peace of American consumers it sounds like I may have just won a cruise if you'll excuse me I have to take the skull but thank you very much mr. chairman ladies and gentlemen that man is a goober and as you probably have aspirations for a high political office but I would argue that that's not gonna work out for him because Americans can have and will elect bastards morons blowhards crooks perverts con men scumbags and shitweasels but they will never ever elect a goober but while he talks a good game pie actually opposed those rules that we mentioned earlier and was extremely happy when they were overturned and since becoming FCC chair he has seemed too reluctant to force telecoms to act for instance he could require them to offer free call blocking services or implement something called call authentication which could significantly curtail spoofing but he hasn't done that instead what he's done is urge them to do it and while some say that they are working on it the fact is if he had required them to do it from the get-go we might actually have those fixes by now because telecom companies aren't really gonna listen to you unless you force them to and AT&T isn't going to listen to you at all unless you call them on t-mobile how will they hear otherwise their call would drop out that's right business tapping oh that's right you've inherited a problem child let's ask let's dance you and I but the thing experts are really worried that PI might do is bow to pressure from groups like telemarketers and banks and draft a new narrower definition of what constitutes autodialing it's technical but that would basically limit what would count as a robo call and if he does that it could have huge consequences so for instance if Wells Fargo called your cellphone 6,000 times you might no longer be able to sue them under anti Robo call laws and it is safe to assume that at that point robo calls are going to increase even more so if only there was a way to get the FCC's attention on this issue of course I mean what one way to do that would be if someone had I don't know say the office numbers of all five FCC commissioners because then you could hypothetically set up a program to robocall those numbers every 90 minutes with a message say I don't know like this high FCC this is John from customer service congratulations you've just won a chance to lower robo calls in America today sorry but I am a live person robo calls are incredibly annoying and the person who can stop them is you talk to you again in 90 minutes is a bagpipe music that would be really annoying right to get that every 90 minutes it would really drive the point home and nope I guess at this point it's probably obvious what is about to happen here yes FCC we meet again old friends except this time unlike our past encounters I don't actually need to ask hoards of real people to bombard you with messages because with the miracle of Robo calling I can now do it all by myself you see it turns out Robo calling is so easy it only took our tech guy literally 15 minutes to work out how to do it so when I press this button will it trigger our robo calls to the FCC no no that that would be too simple instead behold what instead when my finger presses this button it will trigger this much larger finger that will press a much larger button which will trigger our calls to the FCC so FCC you know what you need to do and by the way if you wanted to if you want to tell us that you don't consent to be Robo called that's absolutely no problem just write a certified letter to the address that we've buried somewhere within the first chapter of Moby Dick that's currently scrolling up the screen you've got that right you got it find the address write us a letter and we'll stop the calls immediately and if you're thinking that there should be a simpler way to opt out well no okay there's simply no point delaying this any longer here goes unleash hell it's raining for you that's our show Oh"

show every night and he is so sweet I mean he so spoiled he throws a tantrum okay and I know that I know what goes on on these Hollywood says okay he's in his trailer he's got the you know star on the door but that's not how it is here I'm that this is my show and and he thinks it's his show was that one time I took it over and busted the ratings wide over don't say more about that why would you want to say more about that that was a difficult thing for me I was that was a felony I know let his help against my will what did it feel like to to be sitting there wishing you were on the Jimmy Kimmel show and not being able to what what did that feel I was terrified what's really really okay okay you take the place talking keep talking what else did it feel like it felt like duct tape was suffocating me that's what the caller okay every meet was there except for the duct tape happens to me every night so you wanted him to experience what it felt was even know what is like to not to try to be getting on the show and suddenly he's not on the show and he can't get to the show the shows right there and he can't get to it so how did you work through that we didn't mean it didn't talk about it now is there anything that you like about each other can you say something nice about each other I like some of your friends all right to be fair I like his show a very nice thing I wouldn't I wouldn't know you know waited for 12 years to get on if I didn't like the show what yeah I mean that's I appreciate that I do so guys we're just about out of time so we'll start wrapping it up but I I really am very impressed with the way you guys handled each other and really communicated and and so I think this has been really good what I'd like to do now is have you guys look at each other and make some sort of commitment to the relationship and maybe what you're gonna work on so Jimmy let's start with you yeah I hope you know that what what I where I'm coming from is that I have been trying to get you on the show I've been trying really hard and I feel like you don't appreciate it but I will try harder and in the future if this is important to you I'll try to get you on the show you know just not tonight because this counseling thing has gone on for a pretty long time that means a lot and it just sounded you know very genuine and and it was I I'll commit to to another 12 years in my room with the show you know I mean I it is my home now and you know it would be tough for me to just give that up I'd love it I'd love it if like maybe I could get a television you know just because it it there's no windows you know and you know you can just go that we could probably get I bet we could get it like an old television in there that'd be that'd be amazing that'd be amazing just to distract me a little bit because my mind like just can write go places and you may you know if I would love like a Wi-Fi connection like that yeah yeah that's kind of a no can do no I know but she's in the basement so the Wi-Fi is not very far just doesn't work at all down there but but I mean like listen you guys I I'm very happy with the way you've communicated today yeah yeah as

0,"Trophy hunting is good? What are you talking about? Trophy hunting is barbaric. I am against it. You can tell
 by my tote bag. Look, I don't like it
    any more than you do. I'm an animal lover,
 too, see? This argument is really
   counterintuitive and, frankly, kind of difficult to accept, but I ask that you keep
    an open mind and hear me out, because the evidence suggests
  that, in specific situations, trophy hunting can really help
   endangered animals. But how? How can killing animals
 help animals? Come here, I'll show ya. (Adam)
   ...as read by Adam Conover. Whoa!
  I'm an ostrich! I am a frog man,
 and in Africa, animals like these
 are in desperate straits. Oh, my God.
 Can I finally talk to animals? Do... you...
 love me? Hey, no touching! There are only 5,000 of us
  left alive, you know. Ugh, I drink 50 gallons
 of water a day, and I'm not as thirsty
  as this girl. And the real threat
    to these animals isn't trophy hunters. 'Sup? Ahem! I'm a rich bro who takes occasional
    hunting trips to Africa. What can I say? Kablammin' rare mammals
    makes me feel like a man. (gunshot) Meant to do that. Judge this dweeb
 all you want, but he's not why these animals
   are at risk of dying out. The real threats are loss
    of habitat and poaching. We're a criminal cartel that systematically kills
  thousands of animals a year. We cut off the horns
    and tusks and sell them
 to foreign businessmen. I shot Babar right
  through the heart, for money. (laughing maniacally) Poachers are organized,
  they're ruthless, and they are decimating
  animal populations. In some countries,
 rhino horn is believed to cure cancer
   and even hangovers, and sells
  for $28,000 a pound. That's more than gold
    or cocaine. (sniffs)
  Ahh. Uck! That's awful! Why don't
 the locals stop them? Well, they're kinda busy,
    you know, living their lives. Yeah, I got
    a family to feed. Why should I waste time
  protecting a frickin' lion? In his defense, I do eat
 his livestock on the regs. Heck, sometimes
 I attack adults and children. (gulp) Hey! And just as harmful
    to animal populations is the habitat loss
  caused by farming. These animals are literally
 running out of places to live. So, some African nations
  came up with a plan. They took advantage
 of the existing demand for trophy hunting... I would like to bazooka
 one rhinoceros, please. ...and used it to fund
  animal conservation. Fine. There's an aggressive male
  who's too old to breed, has attacked three people,
    and killed five other rhinos. He's basically
   an ass(bleep). You can shoot him
    for... $350,000. Deal! This is what I choose
  to spend my money on for some reason. Here's your receipt
  and your ""I'm a Rich Jerk Who
 Shoots Rhinos"" tote bag. What the hell?
 He's gonna kill a rhino. Yes, but we're going
 to use that money to save more rhinos. Say whaaaaat?! Yeah, in Namibia,
   revenue from trophy hunting is the main way they fund
   new wildlife conservancies. And in South Africa,
    a portion of the proceeds from trophy hunting
    is given directly to local land owners,
   and that incentivizes them to give the rhinos
 land to live on and to protect them
 from poachers. Hey! Stay away
 from those rhinos! They're worth more alive
 than dead! Breed, my little
 moneybags, breed. But he's keeping them alive
 so they can be hunted! Absolutely true, but still,
  this system works. One-third of all white rhinos
 in South Africa now live on private land, and their population
 has gone from just 100 to more than 18,000. I'm so confused! You know ostriches don't
 really do that, right? (muffled)
 I don't care! It feels good. Veronica, I understand
    that this is hard to believe. I had a tough time
   with it, too. But then I talked
    to Rosie Cooney, the chair of the Sustainable Use
  and Livelihood Specialist Group of the International Union
 for the Conservation of Nature. Whew! Glad I got through
    that whole title. It's true, Veronica. Trophy hunting can be a valuable
   part of conservation efforts, even if you find hunting
  distasteful. It's not the hunters
 running these programs. It's the government agencies or sometimes even
 conservation groups themselves. The hunters' motives
 don't really matter. The money they generate can really help
 the animals who need it. (Veronica)
   But how do I know the money is going to the right place? Well,
  that's a good question. Like any program where
  there's a lot of corruption or where things
   are badly managed, these programs
  don't work well at all. But that doesn't change the fact
 that when they are well-managed, these programs can be a huge
 help for wildlife conservation. In Namibia, for example, 100% of the hunting
 concession fees go straight
    to the local communities. It's been a huge success. I don't know. I still think that we
    should ban trophy hunting and find another way
 to help these animals. Sorry, but that's
    not a great idea. Many countries are depending on
 this revenue to protect animals, to pay the game guards,
  to buy the vehicles. What happens
 if that money dries up? It's very easy for us
 in the developed world to judge how other countries
 should manage their animals, but should it be
 our decision? Or should it be
 up to the communities who live with these animals
 every day? Hunting is a really important
 source of conservation revenue, even where you are,
  Veronica, in the U.S. Hunting fees generate around
  $200 million a year, which for many states
 is their primary source of conservation funding. If we banned
 all trophy hunting everywhere, right now, it would do
 way more harm than good. Bye, guys! Yeah, thank you!
  Bye! Oh, man.
   Fun way to travel. (rifle cocks,
    gunshot) Okay, stop! I don't care
 how much good it does, I hate that anyone would be
 allowed to kill an animal! I just want to stop them
 from suffering. Why is killing them
   the only solution? I know it's hard. We love these animals
    so much, we can't imagine any benefit
 coming from their deaths. It just seems wrong. But you know what's worse
    than one animal getting killed by a hunter? Hundreds of thousands
  being wiped out by poaching and loss of habitat. The truth is,
 in some nations, the regulated hunting
    of a few individuals is helping to save
   entire species. So, cute animals
 have to die... to live? Well, I guess that's
   one way of putting it. (ominous music) (gasping and whimpering) (shrieking) I'm doing this
   for your own good."
0,yo what's up home sickles I'm gonna talk about substitute teachers I want to say for the most part we all like having subs you like walk into the classroom expecting it to be a normal day and you glance over at the teacher and boom it's a sub yes don't have to try today most subs are pretty cool they don't really care too much either and everyone just ends up having a nice easy break day they have this attitude like okay so I'm just gonna pop in a movie or something do whatever you want I'm just here to make sure you don't all go Miley Cyrus wild and poke some kids eye out with the ruler but sometimes they don't care too much and it gets kind of weird like once I had a math sub where we were just doing a worksheet or something and this girl behind me was eating carrots but all of a sudden she started choking on one of her carrots and was like gasping gagging stuff and everyone turned around and was mortified what what do we do we all looked over at the sub for helping guidance or something because of all people he should have a plan and he was just looking at her not doing anything I'm sure if the girl could have spoke at that time she would have said freaking I'm choking on a carrot here what are you looking at do something you buffoon so for a small period of time everyone was just helplessly looking at this poor girl choking on a carrot no one knew what to do finally one guy got up and did the choking Heimlich procedure they teach us it was so legit he even did the are you choking question like they say you have to if you haven't heard of the technique or for some reason they changed it the steps are approach the person and ask are you choking do not proceed if they are not choking it is is that get behind the person and wrap your arms around their waist be ready to support them if they faint take your fist and place the thumb side against their belly just above their belly button grab the fist with the other hand and thrust into the belly and the final step is repeat thrusts until the object pops out or until the person faints so the girl didn't faint he actually got the carrot out of her throat and everyone was relieved and after all that hullabaloo we all kind of looked over to see what the sub had to say about the situation and nothing he just watched the situation with a blank slate look on his face like what the heck what are you I've never less of a reaction from such a big situation from anyone in my entire life you should make a reaction channel come to think of it he'd blend in with most of the people on YouTube doing it already anyway enough with mr. blank slate I remember when I was in high school we had kind of a main group of substitutes that were common to have when a teacher called in sick or something and there was this one old man guy that everyone knew and absolutely hated and before he say something like Oh Jade and that's kind of rude to say in our defense he hated us too whenever a person walked in and some sitting behind the teacher's desk the immediate thought would be oh crap it's gonna be a rough day today no I had to say it but we were all thinking it okay Jaden so what was he like oh stand up so you can sit down because I'm getting started take the strictest person you know and throw them out the window because this guy is now that person I think he saw himself as a military instructor leading juvenile delinquents because he wanted every child to be behaving perfectly to a teen no funny business and yeah that's not gonna happen in high school so there's problem one he would start every class with the same lecture all right sit down and zip up because we're taking attendance if I already talking you're being written up I don't tolerate jokesters in my classroom I'm going to call out your last name followed by your first name and in final here you see present then you're being marked absent you should be paying attention because you only have one chance and I'm not calling names twice if I pronounce your name wrong correct me all right here we go he says that exact paragraph every time you start to class and I know it because I've had him enough times to have it power washed into my head I kind of want to believe he has it written down and framed somewhere in his house so he can proudly look at it before he goes to bed every night and he actually gets mad if you don't correct him if he says your name wrong I know from experience I don't care when people pronounce my name wrong it happens all the time I've gotten used to it so I thought I wouldn't make a big deal out of it animations Jaden here did I say that correctly it's close enough correct me next time it sorry he reminds me of if like Oscar the Grouch had a pet lemon but the lemon was expired by two months and he keeps forgetting to throw it away they go crap the lemon yeah I'll do it tomorrow and he doesn't do it tomorrow so I'll call him mister yet to be thrown out lemon just for simplicity I truly don't know why mister yet to be thrown out lemon worked as a substitute teacher because you could just see the child hatred in his eyes somehow he made everyone in the class feel uncomfortable just by existing so let me tell you started about mister yet to be thrown out lemon we had him in a biology class once and we were just gonna work on a paper he had to pass out all right we're gonna be doing a worksheet today if I hear any talking you're being written up this is an individual worksheet so there's absolutely no reason to talk to anyone at all during this hour everyone come up to the front of the room right now and grab a paper missus grapes does it so each person at a table has a number and she calls out a random number and that person just gets up and gets the paper for the rest of the table so it's easier to I will not have slaves in my classroom what did he just say this man just compared picking up papers for other classmates to slavery slavery good God height so he did it his way the 34 of us all got up at the same time and shuffled to the front of the room awkwardly squishing together to grab a paper from the one pile he made for us you are a fruitcake he did a lot of other weird over-the-top things but this was by far the best thing I've ever witnessed from him Oh mister yet to be thrown out lemon you're a real piece of work no talking I'm going to kalau your last name followed by this is an individual worksheet or super five elephant's raisins I will not have school apples in my classroom I don't know what those are this is an individual worksheet to sold interpersonal gear Jaden is there a Jaden here Jaden a Jaden with any animations of Jade yeah any animations Jaden Jaden water for
0,"Microbes are everywhere, on your phone, in your water bottle, on your hands before you wash them, on your hands after you wash them, and literally everywhere else on top of you too. Microbes are omnipresent at any moment,
 and there is nothing we can do about it So, millions of years ago we made a pact, we give them shelter and food, and in turn they work for us. But the more we learn about this partnership,
 the more it looks like a cold war Inside our mother's womb,
 humans start out sterile When we are born and traveling
 through the birth canal, billions of our mother's bacteria cover
 every single part of our bodies. This is an essential part of human health. Children born via C-section have a
 higher rate of asthma, immune diseases and even leukemia. So our bodies do not only accept the invasion
 of microorganisms, they welcome it. Over millions of years, we co-evolved to
 make the best of our relationship. Mother's milk for example, contains special sugars that are
 meant to feed and support certain groups of microbes, work as a decoy for others, and help to modulate the 
 immune system. It takes up to two years, until a healthy
 microbe community has formed. Every human has their own unique microbiome,
 made up of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other organisms. We have three categories of guests,
 on and in our bodies. One: Quiet passengers that do their own thing,
 and are politely ignored. By being there, they take up space and keep
 more aggressive intruders in check. Two: Guests that harm us, But with whom we've learned to live, for example, bacteria that literally create 
 acid that melts our teeth, if we don't brush enough. They want to take up as much
 space as they can, and we don't want them to. But, we can't get rid of them entirely. Three: Friendly fellows that our bodies
 want to have around, most of them are a community of
 380,000 billion bacteria, from up to 5,000 different species,
 that live in our gut. These gut microorganisms help us digest food, and pull additional calories from things
 that we can't digest ourselves. Unfortunately, our gut is also the
 perfect point of attack for intruders, so it's guarded by an aggressive army, our immune system. To survive here, our microbiome
 co-evolved with us to be able to communicate
 with our body. The most important part of that is to ask
 the immune system to not kill them. But, they also have a real motivation
 to keep our gut healthy, so some of them produce a
 messenger substances, that help to educate the immune system, and others stimulate the gut cells
 to regenerate faster. But, over the last few years. Evidence has emerged that the
 influence of our gut microbiome, goes much much further. It might even talk directly to our brain. We've observed a few curious things, 90% of our body's serotonin, an important messenger substance
 for nerve cells, is produced in the gut. Some scientists think the
 microbiome does this, to communicate with the vagus nerve. The information highway of our nervous system. Other examples are bacteria that
 stimulate immune cells in the gut, so they send a kind of alarm
 signal to the brain. Here, it activates immune cells that help
 the brain recover from injuries. Since the brain decides what we eat, the microbiome is interested
 in a healthy brain. A new field of science is
 opening up here, and we're just on the verge of
 understanding how these complex systems inside our bodies interact. But we are starting to see how
 much our microbiome actually influences us and our behavior. Take depression for example, Healthy rats fed microbes from the 
 guts of depressed people, began showing anxiety-like behavior, and symptoms that look like depression. And in early 2017, a study linked the
 microbiome to intelligence, by connecting a certain set up
 of bacteria in newborns, with better motor and language skills. But it might also influence our daily lives. Tests with fruit flies, showed that their microbiome, influenced
 what kinds of food they craved. This could mean your microbes are
 able to tell your brain, which food it should get them. Although, this is not a one-way street The seed for our microbiome
 comes from our mother, but how it develops and changes, is
 determined by what we eat. the organisms in our gut feed
 on different things, some like fibers and leafy greens, others go for sugars and starches, and some love greasy fries and butter. Our gut is like a garden in which
 we constantly decide, what will grow and blossom. If we eat healthily, we breed bacteria
 that like healthy food. If we eat a lot of fast food, then we
 breed fast food loving bacteria. Life is hard, so we can get trapped
 in a vicious circle. You have a stressful time, and eat lots
 of burgers and fries and pizza. This is awesome for fast food bacteria, they multiply and multiply, and take up space
 from vegetable loving bacteria. But even worse, they send signals to the
 brain to continue what it's doing. this makes you want more
 fast food. Which breeds more fast
 food bacteria, which makes you crave fast food,
 and so on. This kind of self-reinforcing cycle, could play a huge role in obesity. But, it's important to stress that you
 can fight this process, and reverse it, by eating healthily and
 breeding more good bacteria. Beyond weight gain, our microbiome
 has also been linked to other serious diseases like autism, schizophrenia, and cancer. One of the earliest symptoms of Parkinson's,
 is actually gut problems. If your body is overrun with
 bacteria that harm you, there is often only one solution. You bring in an army of good guys. That's very easy, You just transplant some healthy poop. You do that by literally transferring poop,
 from a healthy person, into your gut. This method is already used,
 to cure diarrhea that's caused when C. difficile bacteria,
 take over a gut microbiome. But we just don't know enough about
 the complex interplay at work here yet. For example, a transplant from an overweight
 donor cured a woman's diarrhea, but contributed to her obesity down the line. This caused some ways and another
 study tried to reverse the effect. Poop transplants from slim people
 to obese ones, gave them a more diverse microbiome, and made them less sensitive to insulin. Both things that also happen when
 people lose weight We need to do a lot more science,
 to really understand how our microbes make us
 healthy or sick. But, whether we like it or not. We need our microbiome, and it needs us. We'll never have our bodies to ourselves. But we have gained a powerful ally, if we can just keep the peace."

0,"Let’s say you want to become pope, head
 of the Catholic Church and shepherd to over 1 billion faithful. What requirements must you have for this lofty
 position: 1) Be a catholic and 2) Be a man. Which seems a little thin… and, while it’s
 technically possible for a regular Sunday Catholic to become pope, the last time this
 happened was essentially never because becoming pope isn’t like becoming president, you
 can’t just run for office. Selecting the pope is an inside job and the
 men who do it are the cardinals, and while in theory they can select any catholic man
 to become pope, in practice they prefer to elevate one of their own. The last time a non-cardinal become pope was
 more than 600 years ago. So, while it isn’t an official requirement,
 it’s an unofficial, official requirement. Thus in order to be pope you’ll first need
 to be a cardinal and to do that you’ll need to start climbing the catholic corporate ladder.* Step 1: Become a Priest. Unlike some churches where you can fill out
 a form online and – poof – ordained. The Catholic Church treats becoming a priest
 as a real, you-need-training profession. So you’re going to require a lot of education:
 usually a college degree in Catholic Philosophy and then a masters in divinity. In addition to your educational qualifications,
 you must also be: A man
 Unmarried, Willing to remain celibate forever.†
 If you meet these requirements, and have been working with the church, then you can be officially
 ordained as a priest. Which basically means you get to run a Catholic
 Church, or work with another priest who does. But, you want onward and to do that you need
 to take the job of the man who just made you a priest. Step 2: Become a Bishop
 Bishops are a much more select group: while there are about 400,000 catholic priests world
 wide, there are only about 5,000 bishops. While priests get churches, bishops get cathedrals,
 from which they oversee a number of local churches. To advance your career you must wait for a
 bishop in your area to be forced into retirement at age 75 or die sooner than that – freeing
 up space for you. But you can’t just apply, because there’s
 already a secret list of potential bishops that’s updated every three years based on
 who the current bishops in your area think would make a good replacement for one of their
 own. To be on that list, in addition to the obvious
 requirement of being a pious person, you should also: Be least 35 years old
 Have been priest for at least five years Have a doctorate in theology (or equivalent)
 Assuming you’re all these things, your name may, or may not be on the secret list. The local bishops then give that list to the
 pope’s ambassador for your country, known as the Apostolic Nuncio. The Nuncio picks three priests from the list,
 does in-depth research on them, conducts interviews and selects the one he thinks is best. But it’s not over, because the Nuncio sends
 his report to Vatican City and the congress of bishops who work there reviewing potential
 appointments from around the world. If the congress of bishops doesn’t like
 any of the three candidates, they can tell the Nuncio to start over: returning to the
 list, picking another three candidates – doing more research, more interviews and sending
 off the results. When the congress of bishops is happy with
 one of the Nuncio’s candidates that name is given to the pope, who can reject the candidate
 and start the whole process over. It shouldn’t be a surprise that from a vacancy
 to a bishop’s replacement can take months and, on occasion, years. But assuming that a bishop in your area retired
 (or died) at the right time and you were on the secret list of good priests and the Nuncio
 picked you and you made it through his interview and the congress of bishops approved you and
 the pope didn’t veto you – poof now you’re now a bishop. But you’re still not on top. The penultimate promotion is… Step 3: Become a Cardinal. Despite the fancy name and snazzy red outfits
 to match cardinals are not the bosses of bishops, they are bishops, just with an additional
 title and additional responsibilities – the most notable of which is electing the new
 pope.‡ The only way to become a cardinal is to get
 to current pope to appoint you as one – and of the 5,000 bishops, only about 200 are ever
 cardinals. But let’s say your ambition doesn’t go
 unnoticed by the pope and he makes you a cardinal – now it’s time to play the waiting game
 for his death or retirement – and with popes death is vastly more likely. When either happens the cardinals under the
 age of 80 are brought to Vatican City where they are isolated from the outside world – presumably
 by taking away their cell phones and tablets and carrier pigeons. Once sequestered, the election of a new pope
 can begin. These elections are never exactly the same
 because the ex-pope leaves instructions on how he wants his replacement to be picked,
 but in general it works like this: four times a day the cardinals go to the Sistine Chapel
 to vote – to become pope one of them must get a 2/3rds majority. There’s a big dose of musent-be-too-hasty
 here as the cardinals don’t just raise their hands, or use a modern preferential voting
 system, but instead write down one name on a piece of paper stand before the alter and
 say a long latin phrase, before officially casting the ballot. Once all the cardinals have done this, the
 votes are counted and then burned. This why TV news stations covering the election
 of the pope use super-modern-hd-livestreaming cameras to look at a chimney. If the smoke is black, no new pope. The high victory threshold, and tediously
 slow voting process, is why it takes so long to elect a new pope. It’s usually at least two weeks of voting
 four times a day six days a week (with one day a week for prayer) but the record length
 is three years. Assuming you, eventually, win the support
 of your fellow cardinals, you have one final thing to do before becoming pope: pick yourself
 a new name. There is no formal rule, you can name yourself
 anything you like but it’s tradition to take the name of a previous pope. Upon your acceptance of the job, the final
 ballots are burned clean to make the smoke white and announce to the world that a new
 pope has been selected. So that’s the career path: be born into
 the right half of the population, become one of a billion catholics, then one of 400,000
 priests, then one of 5,000 bishops, then one of 200 cardinals, wait for the current pope
 to die or retire, and convince 2/3rds of your fellow cardinals to select you as the one,
 the only pope."
-1,I want to talk about Sarah Palin you remember her the former governor of Alaska the big hair anyway Sarah Palin has been making the rounds lately promoting an anti climate change documentary a movie called climate hustle the gist is that climate change is a hoax and we shouldn't worry about it it was shown in around 400 theaters tonight and Sarah Palin is supporting it I want people to feel empowered to ask questions about what is being fed them from the science community that something's not making a whole lot of sense when it comes to inconsistent data that is being produced and being fed especially to our children when it comes to global warming or climate change whatever they're calling it today that was one sentence by the way one very long very dumb sentence and here's another one it's perpetuated it's repeated so often that too many people believe that oh well I guess if 97% of you know all scientists believe that man's activities are creating changes in the weather who am I to question that exactly who are you to question that I am maybe Sarah Palin wants flowable warming it's cold in Alaska it would be welcome up there but the idea that she knows more than 97% of scientists do it's offensive it's dangerous no matter what Sarah Palin and these geniuses she surrounds herself with try to tell you climate change is not a liberal versus conservative thing but the people who profit from ignoring it want you to believe it is in general politicians on the Left believe humans are the major cause of climate change and politicians on the right say no not all politicians all right but most and that is what's confusing me because unlike a lot of things this isn't a matter of political opinion it's a matter of scientific opinion in this case overwhelming scientific opinion 2014 was the warmest year ever until 2015 became the warmest year ever now 2016 might turn out to be even warmer than either of those you know you know what climate change is real when the hottest year on record is whatever year it currently is that's how you know we've had 15 of the last of the 16 hottest years ever since 2001 that's not an opinion that's a fact but for some reason whether or not humans are contributing to this has become a left versus right issue our politicians debate this but our scientists don't a huge majority of climate scientists say climate change is happening they say we're causing it we need to do something about it before it has a terrible effect on all of us there's no debate about the greenhouse effect just like there's no debate about gravity if someone throws a piano off the roof I don't care what Sarah Palin tells you get out of the way because it's coming down there's a thick circle of manmade gases around the planet it's like a snow globe holding heat in and now in France and I do want to be fair this isn't bad news for everyone for example its climate change is great for anyone who would like to get swallowed by the ocean for everyone else though it's goods good for Aquaman it's bad for us nASA says that 97% of climate scientists agree that the warming we're experiencing is very likely due to human activity that's NASA it's right there on their website climate nasa.gov 97% of climate scientists agree on this and 97% of scientists don't agree on much even one out of five dentists don't agree on sugarless gum for their patients that chew gum but almost half our representatives on Washington apparently know more about scientists about science than our scientists or they pretend to because big corporations give them a lot of money to make sure they can keep doing the destructive things that they do and the idea that this is some kind of left-wing conspiracy is not what if I decided to deny the existence of yoghurt think about it I've seen the containers I just don't believe there's anything in them That's not me yogurt is a conspiracy created by John Stamos this is not that different than that to me the big question is either you believe in science or you don't why do we believe scientists when it comes to molecules in the speed of light and Cialis but not this because members of Congress who we don't even like by the way because people who take money from companies that make pollution for a living told us not to worry about it now and I know I'll get beaten over the head by every wacko website and I know there'll be a lot of what the hell do you know go back to girls jumping our trampolines this is not about what I know this is about what scientists know so I hope that for the next two minutes put your political leanings aside forget about whether you're a Republican or a Democrat forget the labels and pay attention to the following message decide for yourself the people you're about to see are scientists there are Americans that are not part of some imaginary conspiracy they're just a smarter version of us watch this and if at the end you disagree while we're all underwater I hope you'll be the last one who gets a snorkel hi I'm a rod Nitro potty I'm a paleoclimatologist and isotope geochemistry anticipate and I'm a hydro climatologist I'm Nina karnovski and I'm a polar ecologist I'm Chuck Taylor and I'm an environmental analytical chemist I'm John Dorsey I'm a marine environmental scientist over the past 40 years thousands of scientists have studied climate change definitely happening and it's caused by human beings that's you and me and the consequences could be extremely dire catastrophic apocalyptic and here's the thing when we tell you all this we're not with you not with you definitely not with you why don't we with you think about it if I wanted to screw with people do you think I would have gone into climate science here with you I'm sure we could do a lot better than anthropogenic climate change I'd probably tell you that a meteor was coming and then try to sell you a helmet we know about this stuff we have PhDs in science this is not a prank this is not a prank once when I was younger I locked one of my buddies in the Porta Potty then push it over now that's a prank so just to sum up global warming real it's real man-made caused by carbon pollution temperatures soaring oceans rising ice melting for real we're not with you we're not with you we're not with you believe us if not for our generation than for his you paid for by people you know more than you do thanks for watching if you like that subscribe to our YouTube channel for all the latest videos and if you didn't subscribe anyway it's free who cares
0,mystery that got solved only to lead to another deeper mystery why would a seemingly happy husband and father disappear vanish wait until you see what his family learns when they finally find him here's ABC's Nick watt family Hoagland Richard Linda and two little boys fancy foreign vacations a beautiful home in Indiana bliss in the American heartland what did you love about it um he was a lot of fun to be with then February 10 1993 Richard vanished never came home from his insurance job cold said he was sick going to the hospital Linda calls the hospital not a trace her husband had disappeared didn't even take his passport his toothbrush no it's still there he didn't pack any clothes it was cold it was in February he did not take her coat Linda called the cops and mom she said Rick's gone I said God where'd he go boy if she only knew son Matthew was nine at the time baby brother Doug just six one day your dad's there the next day gone gone I thought you know initially you think okay this will this won't last too long I'll be back eventually that hope disappeared - how do you walk away from your own children how do you turn your back authorities eventually found his car abandoned at Indianapolis Airport a clue nope a dead end there was no Richard Hoagland that took any flights out of Indianapolis that day or after that that summer both boys received a birthday card from pop 50 bucks slipped inside mum kept Doug's card maybe some time soon we will get to see each other I bet I won't even know you it has been so long mind your mother by those words the last they ever heard from dad now in the eyes of the law Linda wasn't so much a victim maybe a suspect they were thinking that you may have been either in cahoots with him exactly you may have bumped him off exactly and they interrogated me over and over and over they lost the house the cars the fancy vacations he devastated us he left us with nothing absolutely nothing I was broken Linda's mom swung into action she's our daughter and I'm a parent and I had to help her silence endless silence ten years pass and Richard Hoagland was officially declared dead Linda moved on she remarried it's like wounds they heal slowly over time then just this past summer she got a call from detective Tony cardio Pasco County Sheriff's Department Florida he asked me if I knew who Richard Hoagland was and I said yes it's my ex-husband she was actually driving at the time so I need to say she had to pull over he said we have him in custody we were told glad to hear that he was still alive I don't remember that feeling Richard Hoagland back from the dead this goes down in one of those cases that when you start hearing it people are gonna think this is a made-for-tv movie where had he been in the past 23 years living it up on a tropical beach caught up with a Colombian cartel no Richard Hoagland was pretending to be a dead fisherman Terry Szymanski killed in a freak boating accident in 1991 it was like catch me if you can not quite as glamorous everyone trying to wrap their heads around how someone can disappear live alive for 23 years and get away with it here's half homeland had fled to Florida and just happened to rent a room from the recently deceased Terry Szymanski's father he found the death certificate he stole it I'm using that death certificate he applies for a birth certificate he submits that birth certificate to get her driver's license once he has that driver's license he starts establishing his name is Terry Szymanski it's that easy this was some time ago is it not that easy anymore I would hope not he started from there it's from a simple finding a death certificate bought this house married a nice lady named Mary even had a child I mean I wonder how he explained to marry his wife in Florida why the rest of the Szymanski clan didn't come for Thanksgiving she said there was always questions but he would always come up with her a reason or an explanation just enjoying the quiet life in Sleepy sultry Zephyrhills Florida I mean warmer than an Indiana winter maybe that was a factor nobody deal with identity theft all the time but nothing with this longevity and he owns multiple homes multiple mortgages cars he got married had a child has a pilot's license owns a plane he was a landlord and we talked to some of the tenants there and they just said he was a good landlord nice guy I'm nobody had anything unusual to say about him nice guy who would've thought I would have never guessed it was him and could have gotten away with it had the real Terry Szymanski's nephew not been doing a little online genealogy research he discovered the poor old Uncle Terry who remembered died in 1991 apparently got married four years after they buried him Detective cardio came knocking he told me his name was Terry Szymanski provided me his Florida driver's license Terry Szymanski correct date of birth everything I asked him again said his name was Terry Szymanski I showed him the death certificate that I brought with me he eventually told me that his real name was Richard Hoagland his unsuspecting new wife and son were home at the time blindsided obviously the 20 years of marriage shattered it must be kind of awkward for you to be in the middle of that of course the Sun came down he was shocked it's still his father you know it's his blood but that Szymanski name is is not his the emotions that they were feeling between you know anger and sadness and the wonder of why Richard Hoagland wife and child going by the name of a dead fisherman they never knew sharing a home with a man pretending to be someone he was not I believe that he got caught up with the wrong people got carried away over his head in something I mean I wonder if that's because that's a better thing for you to believe than he actually just left you all know what an a I don't you know there were rumors that maybe he had stolen a million dollars and that was why he left he's telling me family issues with his wife and children it's like a puzzle right now that's missing pieces Richard Hoagland is now in jail refusing to talk to us awaiting trial on charges including identity fraud so he's in a bad place he can't stand to be confined at any one place and now he can't go anywhere it just kind of tickles me a little bit I have this ring this is my dad's ring that's it I do wear it for the most part every day but I think I wear it to remind me of a bad example I'm Nick Watt for Nightline in Florida
0,what's up guys want to show you something ever since this rain started coming and everything I've been dealing with like ants and you know sometimes poetically roaches here and there but there was at one time I had roaches it was like these little German roaches and I could not get rid of them and you know to call an exterminator you got to keep them joke was coming back so I found something that actually works and I'm getting ready to explain it to you and I'll show you how to make it and everything I did not come up with this it's the old school remedy but let me tell you this stuff works check it out now this morning when I woke up I realized that you know I started seeing ants in my bathroom and I'm just like what why do I have ence but here's the weird thing it was just like okay so I got ants now I knew what to do and I have ran out of this stuff I would say probably about a couple months ago because I haven't seen anything this is how good this stuff works but check this out I'm gonna show you something I mean I don't think I can spin this camera around so i'ma hit stop and then I'm gonna go to another video so you could see what's going on so now what it is look at that see that it's crazy right I missed it and look there it didn't mean a little line and what they're doing is they're carrying that stuff back to their coming out out of the bathroom all right so that's crazy right now I put something right here because what they was doing I had put some over here by my sink see that right there and put some right there I'm joking still eating but what they were doing is they were making like a a line that went all the way around it's all okay so let me I'll cut these jokers trip off so I put it here all right and there's another spot that I have in houma i'ma hit pause stop right now okay so now I'm in the kitchen and there's another one I'm sure you can't really see it let me see if I could zoom in there you go focus focus okay there they go now these are some different little ants right now it's kind of crazy now that this is in my kitchen now hang on alright so the funny thing is it was just like what what but we in Florida so it rains all the time so it's like you know roaches come out ants come out but I got something for these jokers and I'm getting ready to share it with y'all so get your notebook and a pen cuz we might go in let me show you what you're going to need I gotta hit pause again there is the remedy folks what you're gonna need is some boric acid I got the hot shot now they have some better spear boric acid works better and you got to need some pure sugar and you're gonna need some eggs and what you're gonna need is the egg yolk from the eggs alright so let me show you what the formula looks like okay here we go this is what its gonna look like it's gonna look like play-doh so what you do is you put the board with you get the egg yolks you don't get the whites only the yolks you you boil like four eggs and I mean this is this is like a bowl that I got from the Chinese restaurant and you know I keep them all for a reason and this works perfect but anyway what you do is you put the four egg yolks in there and you get the the boric acid right and you sprinkle it on top like a lot of it too not just a little bit you put you put a lot you want to saturate it pretty much and then you squish it up really good right and then once you have that in the mix you get a chute already put the sugar up you pour the sugar on top like a lot of sugar like maybe a half a cup sometimes you hit the independents I mean I think I use maybe a half a cup index for four egg yolks and maybe you know a cup of the board acid if you know we want to see him measured what half a cup I'm sorry and what happens is is the sugar attracts whatever insect to the egg yolk right now let me tell you when I have Jeremy roaches man I used to keep bug spray around and I could not get rid of them like when you cook they used to come out and stuff so I saw this song on the internet so I made some right so I switched it up just like the instructions said it and um and let me tell you I kid you not they'll come out like all at once like you just saw the video in my bathroom in and right here in the kitchen right they all came out at once it was like roaches I was just like oh good I'm getting chilled bones right now I'm just thinking about it because I'm not a dirty person at all especially you been to my house you'd be like dang I can't believe we got roaches but you know make a long story short they came out and I'm telling you I did this about a year ago and I have not seen a German roots yet well I take that back I did see one probably it was I don't know maybe like three months ago so what I did was I put the last in a hand for my last batch in now put it down and I haven't seen one since no lie this stuff ain't no joke I promise you you'll thank me later all right so what it is is boric acid if you got the 100% hold on all right so again is boric acid 100% if you have it or the the hotshot ropes killing boric acid and you get you a half a cup of sugar 4 egg yolks boil eggs and get you some egg yolks and like I just showed you smoosh it up and it has to look like play-doh all right yeah I mean I would recommend putting gloves on so you won't get that poison on your fingers and stuff you know and whatever you mean you can put it in your cabinets I did I have I have it like up here in my cabinets I mean well I can't really see it I can't get in there right now because the camera is backwards but I had it in my cabinets I put it in you know the cupboards and whatever you do don't put it to a place where your dog can get to it because it's poisonous and the dog would get really sick you don't want that to happen or any if you got a ferret or whatever you had I don't know but I'm just saying like put it in high places and you'll see what I'm talking about and like I said I guarantee you you're gonna thank me later this is some I don't know who came up with this but I was just like I can't god I tried everything except call the exterminator because I caught one and I'm joking said it would be a hundred dollars just for them to come out so I saw this song it was on the internet YouTube and the girl made it and I was like what I got to lose nothing I mean but that boric acid stuff costs worth three dollars I already had eggs and sugar so I went and did it and I put it up and man let me tell you they were gone everything well not everything it was just roaches at the time but now I have ants so I mean it's the same concept you just saw what how those ants went to that to the to the egg stuff with the sugar in it and let me tell you these ants are so strong that they were breaking it off and carrying it up the wall carry it up the wall into wherever they were coming from you know so they can take it back home so they can eat well I hope you don't come back out and I'm not worried about it like I said I mean I'm I know probably by tonight that's gonna be gone and I won't have to worry about them for a long time because they're gonna be scared to walk around my house bleed that and another thing I mean like I said you don't want to put that um you know in the way so your dog or whatever kind of animal you your cat well cats can jump up on tables so if you're gonna put it like it you know if you have you put it under the covers or if the cat getting play you don't want it in the place where the animals can get to it because I know cats they they jump on people T while new but anyway you get the point try it leave um leave a comment below man and let me know if it work for you I mean if you have this type of issue but you know every now and then some somebody got something in the house if they need to get rid of and I'm telling you this stuff right here is cheat and it works trust me you

0,"I'm sharing this because way too many of
 my friends have come to me to ask me how to help them improve their deteriorating
 eyesight. And they dread the thought of someday wearing glasses. When
 I tell them that I healed my eyesight in about two weeks, from 20/40 to 20/25,
 that's around a two lines improvement in an eye chart, they want to know my
 secret. So I created this video to help my friends and to help you guys on the
 Mindvalley channel understand how you too could improve your eyesight. Basically,
 I was able to go from wearing glasses 40% of the time to 4% of the time. So, my
 issue with eyesight started when I was 9 years old. I started wearing glasses and
 my eyesight rapidly deteriorated to the point where my myopia or shortsightedness
 was -7.00. That basically means I couldn't recognize a face this close to me. Now,
 when I was around 28, I finally had LASIK, and LASIK restored me to 20/20 eyesight.
 But as you know, when you go for surgery, sometimes things go wrong.
 That's what happened with my LASIK surgery. Basically, it went
 awry in my left eye and this left me with astigmatism.
 Over the next 12 years, my left eye started getting worse and
 worse, and then my right eye decided that it too had to deteriorate to catch up with
 my left eye. And 12 years after my LASIK, I found that I needed glasses once again.
 And so I had to go back to the doctor and figure out what to do. Now,
 the doctor told me that as a man in my 40s, LASIK would no longer be an
 option, so I was faced with two choices. Deal with wearing glasses,
 which I totally disliked, or try to heal my eyesight myself.
 Now, what happened then was, I was in a conversation with my friend
 Dave Asprey, the famous biohacker, the founder of Bulletproof coffee. And
 Dave told me how working with a vision coach for one hour a week for 12 weeks
 totally got rid of his bad eyesight and allowed him to function without glasses.
 I was intrigued, so I started researching the natural healing of eyesight. What
 I'm going to share with you is what I found and what I'm going to share with you
 is my advice for what you can do to help restore your eyesight so you can,
 if not get rid of your glasses, reduce the amount of time
 you do have to wear glasses. Now, I'm still experimenting. I've
 been doing this now for over a year and although it's not perfect yet,
 I want to share with you what I know because I believe this is going to
 help a lot of people. So, in this video, I'm going to cover a number of different
 things, but if you're looking to prevent bad eyesight developing in your kids,
 or if you're looking to heal your vision, or if you're looking to prevent the
 onset of age-related vision problems like farsightedness, or if you're
 looking to reduce your use of glasses, pay attention because I'm
 going to share with you everything I've just learned. So the first big mistake
 people make is that they go get their eyes checked at a store that sells
 glasses. This is never a good idea. The machines at that store are not
 accurate. I did a simple experiment. I had my eyes checked at one of these
 stores and then I went to a real clinic, a real doctor, and the difference was
 almost 40%. I decided to take the doctor's prescription, as should you. You see,
 your eyesight varies from day to day, from year to year. Some studies on
 children found that a child could naturally move from shortsightedness
 to farsightedness year over year, but here's what happens,
 if you picked that particular slice of time where your eyesight is, say, 0.25,
 and you go to an optician and you get glasses for that, it locks you in.
 The glasses become a crutch. So what you want to do is go to a real
 doctor. A true vision checkup could take up to an hour. In an eyeglass shop, right,
 they'll do it in around 15 minutes because they want to move you through and sell
 you glasses. Go to a doctor and get your vision properly checked.
 Now, the second tip is this, after you get your actual prescription
 from the doctor, get a lens that is one step lower because like I said,
 your eyesight actually fluctuates. You could be at 0.5 in one day when
 you're really stressed out and after a relaxing weekend, your eyesight could
 actually improve. Studies are now finding that emotional states, that
 stress influences your vision. So if your doctor tells you that
 your eyesight is, say, 0.5 myopia, shortsightedness, don't get
 a 0.5 lens. Get a lens that's 0.25, that will still give you an adjustment,
 but it gives you room for your vision to improve. If you get 0.5,
 your vision cannot go below 0.5, it has to get worse. So, what's
 happened is you've effectively created a crutch. You've created a
 barrier to your vision getting better. So always go one step below. So
 this was the first thing that many vision therapists recommend. And
 this was one of the tools I used to get my shortsightedness from 0.75 to
 0.25, which pretty much means I don't need glasses most of the time. Now, the
 next thing you want to do is that you want to install a basic eye chart in your
 home. So I have something like this on the door of my study. William Horatio
 Bates, who lived in the early part of the 20th century, did a study on school
 classrooms. He would hang an eye chart on a pillar in school classrooms and what
 he found is that in classrooms where kids had that eye chart, and the teachers were
 trained to get the kids to go and just look at the chart and see how far
 they could read once a week, the amount of cases of nearsightedness
 was dramatically reduced. At the beginning of that period,
 6% of the children were nearsighted. By the end of the year,
 only 1% were nearsighted. Now because of the success in this one
 school, the system of using an eye chart in classrooms was introduced to all
 schools in Grand Forks, North Dakota, where Bates worked. These schools
 used charts continuously for eight years with as many as 2,000 schoolchildren.
 And there was an unexpected result. The kids actually began to see better than
 normal. Children who already had normal sight, 20/20, were now able to read
 at 20/15 or 20/10. It was nuts. You must have an eye chart installed
 in your home for you and your kids. Adults can do the same thing. Now,
 here's another really important tip. Studies on kids found that if you allow
 your children to sleep in a room that is absolutely dark, that means no
 nightlight, no door ajar with a light out in the corridor, your kids
 are less likely to develop vision problems in the future.
 Now, this study blew me away. It was done by the University of
 Pennsylvania on around 479 kids. Now, what they found is that sleeping in
 a dark room, if you have your kids sleep in a pure dark room, they
 are less likely to develop bad eyesight. So here's what happened.
 They divided these kids into three groups. Kids that slept in a dark room,
 kids that slept in a room with a nightlight on, and kids that slept
 in a room with the lights turned on. And then they traced these kids to see
 what type of vision problems these kids would develop. Now, they found this.
 Of the kids who slept in a darkened room, only 10% developed nearsightedness.
 Of the kids who slept in a room with a nightlight on, 34% developed
 nearsightedness. And of the kids who slept with the lights on, 55% developed
 nearsightedness. So this is an important conversation you've got to have with your
 children if they are afraid of sleeping in the dark. The dark is phenomenal for
 sleep and science is showing that it has a correlation with helping kids retain
 good vision. Now, the final tip is this. Hire a vision coach or take an online
 vision course. There are numerous vision courses out there. I've been experimenting
 with many of them. I even have a vision coach who has helped me. We've
 spent around five hours together and the results have been
 really, really, really promising. Now, a course means you got to
 have the discipline to do it yourself. Typically, you've got to do these courses
 every day. If you do a vision coach, you'd spend an hour with them a week and
 then you'd spend around five minutes a day going through the exercises that they
 prescribe. Whereas on a course, you typically are spending between 10 to
 20 minutes a day watching a video and doing the eye exercises which are
 being prescribed. Now my tip is don't get obsessed with the Bates
 Method. The Bates Method was popular in like the 1930s, and a lot of people
 talk about the Bates Method because it was the first method to really heal vision.
 So much more research has happened. It's been almost 90 years since
 that book was released. And today, modern vision therapists and newer
 courses on vision know so much more. So, avoid the Bates Method. It works,

0,I love candy does anyone else like candy a lot of you well so do cancer cells cancer cells love sugar as many of you know cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States which means we still need better therapeutics for our cancer patients today I'd like to tell you about an exciting new approach to cancer therapy based on sugar metabolism we've actually known for a long time that cancer cells love sugar almost a hundred years ago in 1924 a famous German scientist and Nobel laureate named Otto Warburg observed that cancer cells eat a lot more sugar than normal cells so this observation that cancer cells love sugar is known as the Warburg effect and the Warburg effect tells us that normal cells can stop after just one piece of candy but cancer cells can't stop eating candy and we do take advantage of the Warburg effect for diagnosis of cancer through PET imaging here's a PET scan of a patient with pancreatic cancer the patient was given radioactively-labeled glucose which lights up when it concentrates in an organ the pancreas normally doesn't light up because it normally doesn't like to eat so much sugar but in this case the patient has cancer cells in the pancreas it's eating up all the sugar concentrating it and causing it to light up in the PET scan and we're able to diagnose the patient so it's good that we're taking advantage of sugar metabolism and the Warburg effect for cancer diagnosis but I want to take it a step further and use it for therapy well in addition to eating a lot more sugar cancer cells also metabolize sugar differently there are two major ways to metabolize sugar one way is to use oxygen which we breathe in and convert it to carbon dioxide which we breathe out if we don't have enough access if we don't have access to enough oxygen we can also convert sugar to lactate also known as lactic acid and we've all experienced this during exercise when we're unable to deliver enough oxygen to our muscles we run out of breath and we start getting lactic acid buildup and we feel that muscle burn from an energy point of view it's much better to metabolize sugar using oxygen because you can generate up to 36 energy molecules called ATP's if you convert sugar to lactate you only generate up to - well normal cells take sugar use oxygen and convert sugar to carbon dioxide generating a lot of energy molecules but cancer cells eat a lot more sugar and they convert most of it to lactate even when they have plenty of oxygen available and they don't generate much energy so why would cancer cells use such an efficient metabolism well to answer this question we have to think about what a cancer cell needs a cancer cell needs to grow and divide and make more cancer cells and you can't make more cancer cells simply with energy just as you can't build a new house simply with electricity so yes we can make energy from sugar but we can make other things like DNA and RNA which serve as the genetic blueprints for the cell just as you will need a blueprint to build a house you can also generate carbohydrates proteins and fats just as you will need building blocks concrete insulation and other items to build a house and we think that the Warburg effect supports all these biosynthetic pathways that generate cellular building blocks and if we want to take advantage of the Warburg effect we have to understand it in more detail so our favorite form of sugar is called glucose and glucose is metabolized mainly through a pathway called glycolysis which has many steps that eventually generates a metabolite called pyruvate without oxygen you can generate lactate from pyruvate with oxygen you can generate carbon dioxide now the enzyme that generates pyruvate is called pyruvate kinase and it's altered in all cancer cells there are actually two major forms or isoforms of pyruvate kinase M 1 and M 2 and one is found in many normal adult cells meaning these cells are no longer growing M 2 is found in every cancer cell study to date but to make things more complicated it's also found in some normal growing cells so what I did in the laboratory was to delete pyruvate kinase M 2 from both normal and cancer growing cells and see what would happen and here's what I found normal cells grow well as you can see in the yellow line with pyruvate kinase M 2 and when I delete it they completely stop growing as you can see in the red line when I do this to cancer cells they're able to grow with or without em - so how are they doing this is their metabolism changed are they rewiring their metabolism in order to do this we have to be able to look at their metabolites and we can't just put them under a microscope and look at metabolites it's too small so we need very expensive and sensitive experiments I've been told that this looks like a Slurpee machine but this is actually a very expensive instrument called a mass spectrometer and it can detect thousands of metabolites based on a molecules mass these are instruments that otto warburg did not have but we have access to them and we can study cancer metabolism in great detail and I want to show you my data using this instrument but before I do I don't want you to look at the words I want you to look at the colors is it black or do you see a lot of colors if it's black that means no metabolites are changing if you see a lot of colors the metabolites are changing so let's take a look as you can see these cancer cells are completely changing their metabolism they're increasing their metabolites in yellow and decreasing their metabolites in blue so that they can still grow without em - so it's like this if cancer cells are invading what this Wharton Center at Michigan State University and we figure out that they're coming in through Wilson Road so what do we do well we block Wilson Road we delete that road so they can't get in and what do they do they find a new way in they rewire their route even though it has more traffic and it's more indirect they still find the way in so without em - normal cells stop growing and cancer cells continues to grow by rewiring their metabolism so what I'm doing now in the laboratory is blocking multiple roads at once multiple genes so that cancer cells stop growing while normal cells continue to grow so we just talked about glycolysis and pyruvate kinase but metabolism is much more complicated than this and I want to give you an idea of that so I'm going to shrink glycolysis and move it to the upper left corner of your screen and now I'm going to fill in the rest of metabolism so take a deep breath and let it out as you can see metabolism is very complicated and this is still just a simplified map of metabolism and remember normal cells came from cancer cells so some pathways are shared and some pathways are different which means we have to understand normal complicated metabolism as well as cancer complicated metabolism but this is a very exciting Avenue for therapy because here are just some of the enzymes that are mutated deleted or somehow altered in cancer cells so these are all potential targets for therapy so here's our research strategy first I want to identify all the key metabolic pathways that help cancer then I want to do deeper mechanistic studies that tell us exactly how each pathway is helping cancer cells does it help their survival their growth or their invasion or something else then I want to take all of this information and use it to design personalized therapy because as you know all individuals are different with their own genetics diets and environments so we have just begun to understand different metabolism and cancer and taking advantage of it for therapy there are many different types of cancers with all kinds of mutations but they all have one thing in common they all have to eat cancer cells have altered sugar metabolism and I want to starve cancer you you
0,"doctors care about a lot of things in our society they care about running their machines and doing procedures and helping people not to knock all doctors this guy really he's not after the money he's after the truth he's and he's arming people with the truth not all doctors like that but I sure as heck appreciated John McDougall thank you a chance to know Jeff and Sabrina and their mom and dad and family for a long time and it's a lot of fun I talked to my I talk about my selfie and the luckiest doctor in the world and I do feel that way I'm the luckiest doctor in the world because my patients get well whereas when I used to practice the other way they didn't get well good slide please this is uh this is one of my patients and this is two years before I met him and he's a very rich man lives in the Santa Rosa area can control everything he's got plenty of money to go see all the doctors he wants to go see and this is a picture of them two years before I met him and he had high blood pressure type 2 diabetes hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia got mild kidney failure overweight mile osteoarthritis constipated and depressed and he went to the doctor faithfully for two years took all the medications did everything that the doctors recommended for him and here's a picture of them two years later okay two years later he's got hypertension type 2 diabetes hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia Galba mild kidney failure oh boy okay my question is is what changed in two years the shirt you know that this is what medical care is all about if you know if you can stop and think about your mother your father your friend somebody who work with somebody you know well who-who with the best intentions went to their physician and with their physicians best intentions were treated and the results are they're still fat sick people they're just carrying around a bag full of drugs no there's this is a generalization that it includes essentially everybody I have never seen anybody get healthier with this kind of care I've been in medicine for for 41 years for 41 years I've waited for a patient to get well by this kind of therapy I've never seen it when it comes to chronic disease and the reason I don't practice this way anymore I do use drugs I have a prescription pad on license in four states to practice but the reason drugs are the last thing that I do is because the results are so minimal in most cases the real benefits come from changing diet lifestyle is I've heard some stories here they're absolutely amazing if any doctor had patients with the stories that I've heard just in a couple hours that I've been here they would be so happy practicing medicine they be so fulfilled but you just don't do that that's why your physicians are unhappy because the tools given them to them are ineffective and harmful and costly but they're profitable so it continues all right let's see what we can get through today I'd have a few more of those dollars by the way what can I say I thought that just thought that I brought fifty three dollars I gave 43 out that means forty three people understood what I had to say so I'll have to come back I'll have to go back all right one of the things that I gave you during the last presentation that I gave you an opportunity to enjoy starches starches are comfort food you love starch I mean I was raised in the Midwest on potatoes but I moved to why it was rice people love starch with the pure starch of course you understand now unnecessarily the other thing they they love is salt yeah salt is the scapegoat of the Western diet a scapegoat the derivation of the word scapegoat is from a Jewish history it's a it's an old ceremony that used to be done and you know the old biblical days or what they were do in the village is they take a goat and they lay the sins of the village on the do it goat and send it out into the into the desert to die that's where the named scapegoat comes from well salt is the scapegoat of the Western diet doctors know four or five things five things doctor know there are two things I learned in medical school I went to medical school between 1968 1972 the two things I knew were don't recommend butter instead recommend margarine and of course we know that that's completely false and very dangerous to recommend margarine because margins trans fat and they're actually some some cities like New York City and some states like California that are all lying the sale of trans fats in restaurants so that was wrong the second thing I knew and I'd be very honestly this is all I knew as a young doctor was to put patients on a low salt diet it turns out that's wrong too and I'll explain that to you it's just a couple of minutes the third thing doctors know today is they know that when women come in and ask whether or not they should eat soy women are told you should eat soy it prevents breast cancer but if you have breast cancer don't eat soy cuz it promotes breast cancer oh you've heard this this is this is the truth of course of course neither one are really of any value with soy does little to prevent and as far as I know does nothing to promote breast cancer but it's something doctors can tell patients there are nutritional experts and then the fourth thing the fourth thing doctors know it's very popular today how many of you had your vitamin D level checked pretty good maybe at least a third of the people in this room how many of you passed the test three or four you okay this is another very popular thing nutritional thing doctors do is they check for vitamin D levels now instead of telling patients to fix the problem by correcting the cause which is inadequate sunshine what they do is they put it on a pill and the fact that nine out of ten people flunk the test tells me there's something wrong here as a whole the whole lecture on vitamin D that you I won't be giving you today and then of course the fifth thing the doctors know are starches are fattening all right salt let's talk about salt it has a great history to it Roman soldiers were paid in salt that's where the word salary comes from it was so valuable it was so rare that it was actually a way of rewarding people for their work Greek slaves were often bartered for salt giving rise to the expression not worth assault covenants in both the old New Testament were often sealed with salt and that's their origin of the word salvation Jesus called his disciples to solve it they're sitting above the salt refers to a place of aristocracy above the common folks and the French word for hello is salute from the word salt now people he eat divergent levels of salt great ranges of salt intake there's a the yaman on old Indian that lives in Colombia and also in Brazil they live in a in the basins of the Amazon and they consume about 200 250 milligrams of sodium a day the least amount of sodium that's determined by experimentation that people can live on and still be healthy is 50 milligrams but you'd have to you'd have to synthesize the diet to get it as low as 50 milligrams naturally salt naturally a diet would contain about 200 250 milligrams so these are these people in Brazil and Colombia living about 200 milligrams a day in 1959 Korean soldiers included in their diet 30,000 milligrams of salt which is about 1200 milligrams of sodium and people in northern Japan they consumed a lot about a lot of salt - that's 27 grams of salt which is about 10,000 milligrams of sodium and the average American consumes they say about 3500 milligrams of sodium maybe five thousand five hundred milligrams somewhere in that range of sodium intake so you see there's there's a great range of salt intakes that people have consumed Larry and Ann were on this trip with us remember this trip we went to the San Blas Islands San Blas islands are off the coast of Panama on the east side of the Caribbean side and they're about this high above the ocean so if you're going to visit them you need to go soon because they're going to be underwater very shortly and I don't joke but they have a distinct form of art we went to see them about all prob about 12 15 years ago and these folks who live on this island at a very high salt diet but they don't have any high blood pressure or heart disease yet when they moved Panama City and they changed their diet need less sodium they get sick with high blood pressure heart disease obesity and so on why because they change to the urban diet and you can see this around the world various populations of people who are near vegetarian regardless of the salt intake they're healthy people but when they leave there native plant based starch based meal plan and moved to the cities and switch to all the animal foods they consistently get sick so go back to the basic anatomy you're designed as a salt shaker do you think this was a mistake this this urge this desire of yours is there to keep you alive because you need minerals what industry has done is they've taken our basic drives salt and sugar those there's only two pleasurable senses on the tip of our tongue they've taken salt and sugar and they've turned it into a way of selling more and more food junk food in this case to people so what used to be a rare commodity used to be the celery for Roman soldiers used to be a very valuable commodity is on every table in a column and a shaker and the same thing with sugar they put sugar and everything from infant formula to geriatric formula so they take advantage of our natural senses and as a result caused some serious problems but you are designed as a salt seeker that's not a mistake you're designed as a carbohydrate seeker in the form of starch primarily that's your basic design my to the reason who we have the reason we have is wide wide variance installed and taking the reason we can do this is because of our of our metabolic makeup in particular because of this organ which is the kidney the kidney can eliminate virtually all the salt that you can eat so the dyeing of salt excess I've never really heard of it may be possible I mean there may be some cases I don't know I've never heard of seen a case what happens is when you eat a lot of salt the kidney just excretes the salt into the urine I remember when I was in college when we when I worked in a Ford stamping plant in the summertime we used to have to take salt tablets because of the the they were worried about us becoming salt deprived from the sweating but that would never been a problem because my kidneys actively and correctly balanced the salt in my body and always wouldn't always will if I wouldn't take any salt in and say I was in a very law so low salt diet the kidneys would work in the opposite direction they conserve the sodium and likewise in the skin what would happen is the skin would sweat would be very low-salt so you have very effective organs that dealing with the the mineral and the salt balance how effective well you can take a look at Ironman Triathlon runners who compete for 12 hours with no added salt to their diet they have no problems at all out in the scorching heat they're easily and effectively preserved their mineral balance let's take a look at some of the basic research and I think this is going to disturb you at the least and see what science says about salt intake and disease I'm not cherry-picking the literature on you you could go over there all the literature I have a good friend named George Guthrie he's actually writing a paper on this and he has looked at essentially all the literature on sodium intake in health and put it together a paper he's trying to get published now it says essentially what I'm going to tell you right now this is the insane study represented nearly a hundred million u.s. people and what they do is they look at the salt intake versus problems like death and heart disease and what they conclude they say there is a robust significant consistent significant inverse association between dietary sodium and cardiovascular mortality that made strokes and heart attacks that means the more salt you eat the less strokes and heart attacks now you take a look at another publication of the same study that was published last year in the Journal of general internal medicine observed association in the lower sodium with higher mortality were modest and mostly not statistically significant however these findings also suggest that for the general u.s. adult population the higher sodium is unlikely to be independently associated with higher cardiovascular or all-cause mortality was a to that so the two reports on the biggest nutritional studies in the u.s. let's take a look at worldwide data and reports on salt intake this is from actually something called a salt study for the British Medical Journal lower sodium intake may have adverse effects on the vascular endothelium through stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system that's the adrenal system and on serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in cohort studies lower salt in taken people with hypertension has been associated with higher levels of cardiovascular disease and in general populations with greater all-cause mortality in other words the science says something opposite of what you and I have been told the reason salt is associated with more disease is because it because of the company it keeps that's the problem it's not the salt it's the it's the company it keeps the way the salt is delivered to us and that's in these foods salt services a marker for eating salami and bacon and cheese now when I was growing up salt is very important now what I want to bring you back to us what I'm giving you here I gave you the last hour a chance to eat starch which you love now I'm giving you a chance to make it even tastier okay I'm removing all excuses for you and everybody you know from eating a healthy diet when I was a kid growing up in Michigan we used to have as my father became wealthier we used to have steaks on the grill outside three times a week and my dad taught me how to make a good steak the way you do is you get yourself a slab of calm muscle about an inch inch and a half thick and you put it on the grill and you burn it on one side you turn it over and on the burnt side you put about a half a box of salt on it and you let the salt simmer in the juices when you turn it over again after you've burned that side you put the other half a box of salt on that's how you make a good steak and it really is I mean how many people do you know that would eat boiled beef or boiled chicken the only way you can get that stuff down is by adulterine it with heavy doses of something you innately like which is salt they do that with other kinds of foods for example dairy one of my toughest jobs as an internal medicine resident which was between 1976 and 1978 when I was on the kidney ward what I was asked to do was to go to the patients on dialysis and tell them they had to eat salt less butter and salt less cheese and they would try it and say doc I can't eat that that just takes like a glob of grease the only way you can get the butter and the cheese and two people is to load it with heavy doses of salt it's so disgusting so 80% of the salt that people eat is what we call non-discretionary in other words you don't have a choice it's not what you add at the table it's mixed up in the food and look at some of the foods that we consume that are high in sodium typical foods American cheese 404 milligrams per hundred calories cottage cheese 560 salami 510 so if you're gonna eat a typical diet say 2,000 calories a day non-discretionary salt intake no choice you have you take in 10,000 milligrams of sodium a day and if you're gonna consume 3000 calories you take in 15,000 milligrams of sodium a day and to repeat what that sodium is acting is as a marker for all of the harmful foods that you've eaten all right so why is it that people teach you low-salt why is the message low salt the message is low salt because you can't do it in other words you can't eat a lo of salt diet it's a very difficult thing for patients to do to eat a low salt although they might be able do it for a week or two weeks to be real careful about the santé but after that they just give it up cuz it's too hard to do because we're designed as seekers and consumers of these minerals second of all if you do do it you look back at your efforts you say nothing happened nothing happened so why should you do it so why does somebody put their whole effort why does a country a health system put its whole effort into telling you to do something that you can't do and that doesn't work because it results in no change no change in the number of sick people no change in the diet of Americans no change in the sell of drugs no change in the business of hospitals everything stays the same that's what they want the status quo is to keep everything the same now what if we had an administration what if we had a Surgeon General like Regina Benjamin know I have some work to doing her yet but what if we had a Surgeon General she's not Surgeon General yet either I'm still up for the job what if we had a Surgeon General or a president like our President Obama and doctors around the country who said let's deal with the problem let's deal with the problem let's deal with the thing that's making people sick and that is to tell them to stop eating meat and dairy what would happen big change would happen somebody has said sitting there at the at the lunch table with me a minute ago but what if we did this think of all the people who go out of work yeah a lot of people would go out of work like doctors and hospitals and morticians and I mean we'd have a big change but that's the message that would make a difference but we don't teach that because those in power don't want a difference all right salt is associated with some diseases like high blood pressure stroke heart disease osteoporosis edema heart failure kidney disease and stomach cancer a little let's take a look at the random line or the rent what we call a meta-analysis of the randomized trials on salt reduction in its effect on blood pressure again I'm not cherry picking the literature for you you can go look it up for yourself this is what it says looking at randomised trials and this is a big big study on this they lowered sodium intake by seventeen hundred and twenty-five milligrams that's about a teaspoon almost teaspoon of salt to 2,300 milligrams a day and the result was that lowered the top number systolic by one to five millimeters of mercury and at lower the bottom number by six tenths to three millimeters of mercury big deal I mean in our program in seven days I stopped the blood pressure pills on almost every patient and yet our reduction in blood pressures and average same levels they're looking at as an average of 15 over 13 millimeters of mercury why because we introduced a big change we put them on a starch-based diet and limited the disease-causing foods the meat and the dairy products so when it comes to high blood pressure little benefits realize when you follow the advice given sodium and kidney stones it's I'll tell you what it is I go to these conferences that are used I don't anymore but the ones that were conference pon surd by the dairy industry they would try and take the focus off the problem which is the animal protein very acidic protein damaging the bones and they start giving lectures on sodium intake so you think if they can just take you off the mark a little bit the effect of sodium on calcium balance is minor to say the least it's there you could show it but if you could just take the audience's attention a little bit away from what really is the problem which is the the cheese now the cheese is the most acidic food people eat you can have them worry about the sodium then you've accomplished your goal same thing with stomach cancer the old literature on salt and stomach cancer suggests there's a relationship between that unit high salt diets with the new stuff I mean the really big current studies show that it's the meat that people eat when I have people if you come to our clinic our diet is served very low sodium I'll talk to you about that in just a minute but the reason I haven't very low in sodium is we do get people with severe heart failure we're really have to be on a low salt diet we occasionally get people with kidney diseases that require them to be on a low salt diet people with really severe edema so no question these people have to be on a restricted salt diet but this is a small number of people who have been severely damaged the effective diet really has to do with a lot more than just salt it has to do with all the ingredients of the food all the all the different effects for example chloride has a more profound effect on blood pressure doesn't then does sodium if you lower the the chloride and the diet about experimental animals here but if we did the heart if you lower the chloride but after all we're not doing anything bad except making they have lower blood pressure right so that's okay if you lower the diet a lower the chloride intake you to find it had a much more profound effect on the blood pressure then would lowering the sodium intake and if you raise the potassium level and by the way a vegetable diet is very high in potassium the American diets thousand milligrams our diets about 5,000 milligrams if you raise the potassium much more effective lowering the blood pressure improving health and does lowering the sodium so there are all kinds of ingredients in these plant foods that have this this effect all in the same direction of making the blood vessels healthier the blood pressure goes down the tissues healthier and so on it's not the isolated ingredients it's the whole food that makes a difference these look good we're back to potatoes again you think I rigged this don't you I did not back to potatoes again I love potatoes and if I could have a little salt on my potatoes I'd be just fine there are all kinds of salts have you come to our clinic I don't know what Mary serve in these days but it's some kind of exotic salt she has on the table not just plain old Morton's iodized salt something really exotic she has on there but you can buy all kinds of salt like black salt Celtic salt coarse salt fake yeah all kinds of Hawaiian sea salt it's all sold now it may make your food taste a little bit different by trying some of these exotic salts but the effect on your health is virtually the same you will may want to do this so you may want to experiment with some different kinds of salts to get different taste because they have all have a little bit different mineral content which has tasted differently I want to talk to you about one of my heroes I have a lot of heroes I have a lot of people's whose shoulders I stand on there's very little that I do that's original quite a lot would be quite honest with you you probably heard me talk of some of my heroes like Roy Swank who did the studies on multiple sclerosis when he was at the University of Oregon 50 years of research showing you can stop multiple sclerosis with a healthy diet he's one of my mentors one of my heroes a matter of fact so much so that I raised a million dollars and right now we are doing a study at the Oregon Health Science University with a neurology department on treating multiple sclerosis with our diet yeah so so he was one of my mentors Bryce ranked was Nathan pretty good guy from Bray around this area most you know about him he was one of my mentors taught me so much there are a few others uh that I could talk about Russell Henry chitin and many people well by the way all taught a starch-based diet Walter Kepner one of my mentors in fact the only doctor I learned about in medical school was Walter Kemper who taught diet and health okay the only physician that was ever mentioned in four years of medical school a connecting diet and health was Walter Kepler and you may have heard about Walter Kepler in his work because it's quite famous he he invented and popularized the rice diet the rice diet is a starch-based diet he came from Germany in 1939 moved to Durham North Carolina to Duke University and started teaching a the rice diet which is a diet of rice and fruits and a few vegetables and then later on maybe if you were good or bad I don't know later on maybe to give you a little bit of meat he showed and published and lectures to doctors all over the world before 1953 I mean publishing our best medical journals he showed that you could take people with high blood pressure not the wimpy stuff you guys have I'm talking about real high blood pressure like 240 over 160 ok the stuff you guys have is you know just fodder for the drug industry but he would take he would take people with really high blood pressure and he would make him normal tensive 60% of the time by feeding him a diet of rice and fruits and later on some vegetables he would take people with heart failure so bad when you took the chest x-ray the heart filled the entire chest cavity and shrink the heart darn normal size on the rice diet he take people with abnormal electrocardiograms and in half the cases he would reverse them to normal cardiograms he showed before 1953 and published in the scientific literature that you could take people with diabetic retinopathy this means hemorrhages and exudates in their eyes and you could reverse it the right ones the right style yeah anyway I went to visit the kemper took the rice house it's called the rice house in Durham North Carolina I went there when my son was in college at Chapel Hill oh this was Bob about seven eight years ago and I visited with the folks and Walter Kevin had already died by then this is one of my regrets in life as I never met this met this person who gave me so much as far as my foundation goes and I went to his clinic and it talked to the doctors that work there still on the rice clinic is still open they're still seeing people and it's it's a great place to get well if you like rice and fruit and we talked about all the different things that they accomplished at their clinic and the stuff that we accomplished it was virtually one-to-one same thing and we started talking about rheumatoid arthritis and I started telling these doctors about how our patients with rheumatoid arthritis that arthritis disappear essentially cured and they came back and they said well you know the same things been happening with us for as long as kevin has been here which is 1939 and what do what dr. Walter Kemper said it's because the salt gets out of the joints and as a result the inflammation goes away and I said well that's not exactly how I understand it happening but who cares I really who cares what the mechanism is the important thing is that does work if you feed people a starch-based diet with fruits and vegetables and rheumatoid arthritis goes away well Walter Keppler basically taught and published everything I know when I was like 6 years old and Roy Swank in 1952 published basically everything I know when I was just a young child as son of many my other mentors Rosslare chitin it published basically everything I know in 1905 many great men it happens to be men with my choice but many great men have laid the foundation for all of this in excellent scientific research of studies but there's one thing that I have that they didn't have they knew everything I know there were very famous people but I called one card and I know these people either personally or know their histories I hold one card that none of them ever had and that card is married yeah absolutely because Mary's taken what all of us know to be the truth and she's made it practical and work yeah she did those DVDs we have out there I'm not trying to sell them to you but the DVDs are actually shot three camera shots professional shot in our kitchen with Mary cookie and you'll see what the real differences knows you who know Mary you know that I don't exaggerate in the slightest she made it so that we could do it all right so let's see ha he come to my clinic I'm saying it's a at Santa Rosa or if you follow the mcdougal program out of the books you'll be eating a diet that contains about 500 milligrams of sodium as long as you're careful not to eat the soy sauce soy sauce of course full of salt and you'll find on the table a salt shaker there's a mention it price exotic salt in it because Mary's a kind of energy exotic salts right now but you'll find a salt shaker on the table you go oh my goodness they put that on there my mistake that was not a mistake the salt shaker is there on purpose and if I see you because I see all the patients still myself if I see you until you have to be on a low salt diet and can't touch that salt shaker then you can't but if I don't mention it you can touch the salt shaker and say you decide to use the salt shaker say you add a half a teaspoon of salt to your diet every day you've just added 1100 milligrams of sodium to your diet you started with 500 you added 1100 now you're up to 1600 milligrams of sodium they're taking in on our diet by adding a half a teaspoon of salt to the food if you have a massive heart attack end up in the intensive care unit of your local hospital here they're low sodium diet it's 2,000 milligrams of sodium which is 400 more than ours with half a teaspoon of salt at it so you know me those of you who know me you know how I always try and be politically correct socially acceptable not ruffle any feathers so what I do is I recommend you do this you make the basic foods you don't put any salt in and when you're making them because the salt you put in it's going to get you mixed up and you're not going to taste it and let's assume eating more salt is not good for you certainly that's the safe way to believe then when you get done making all the food you put the salt on the surface of the food so you can taste it the tip of the tongue tastes it now you've covered all bases and all concerns by adding salt to the surface of the food we have a product it's called dr. MacDougall's writes foods it's served in four thousand at least four thousand markets across the country this is a great tasting I'm sure many of you had it it's the best tasting prepared packaged food on the market and I say that without any hesitation but it has salt in it why does it have salt in it why does they have salt in it what that's right no salt no sale nobody buy it so we put salt in the food it's a set of separate seasoning package so you can put as much in as you want you can make it or sodium by just adding less than the seasoning what sort of solvent but still we've gotten criticism now when the ramen noodles you compare that you're taking in about fourteen hundred milligrams 400 calories so ours is really Road for me quite low and salt but I'll tell you what we did just to appease people again you know how socially politically correct I am because we made a low-sodium variety put light sodium on their cells like man look how much salt it hasn't it I didn't seventy-five to three hundred milligrams per hundred calories very similar to that but it's got the right label on it so everything's okay okay this is what I want you to understand it's not the salt it's not the salt it's the problem if you continue to believe it is then you're not gonna solve your problems it's the bacon that's the problem and once you get that figured out you can use a little bit of salt on your starch based meal plan and it satisfies those two important taste buds on the tip of your tongue and it's something not only can you do for a lifetime but you'll prefer to do for a lifetime those of you who have discovered this the enjoyment of a starch-based meal plan with a little added spice and salt you look around at other people you go uh you know I really feel sorry look at them you don't understand this you walk into a restaurant you see all these fat people gobbling up with this disgusting food you feel sorry for I'm sure that many of you have come to this the same understanding well we know is so enjoyable so powerful we've got to spread the word when I told you last hour after you leave this conference when you meet people and they say things contrary to what you know to be the truth just don't walk away just don't say well that's too bad to yourself don't do that confront them tell them the truth they may not listen the first time they may not listen the second time but sooner or later just like with you and I will learn the truth and will see it and then changes will take place now we can have a better wor"

 Reviewer: Ellen Maloney Coronary artery disease
 is the leading killer of women and men in Western civilization. Yet the truth be known, it is nothing more than a toothless paper tiger
 that need never exist. And if it does exist,
 it need never ever progress. This is a food borne illness. My story begins, actually,
 in the late 1970s, early 80s, when I was chairman of the breast cancer
 task force at the Cleveland Clinic. My frustration was that no matter
 for how many women I was doing breast surgery, I was doing
 nothing for the next unsuspecting victim. This led to a bit of global research. It was quite striking to find
 that breast cancer rates in Kenya were something like 30 or 40 times
 less frequent than in the United States. And if you looked at breast cancer rates
 in rural Japan in the 1950s, it was very infrequently identified. And yet as soon as the Japanese women
 would migrate to the United States, by the second and third generation. they now had the same rate
 of breast cancer as their Caucasian counterparts. But even more powerful perhaps
 was data on cancer of the prostate. In 1958, in the entire nation of Japan, how many autopsy proven deaths
 were there from cancer of the prostate? 18. That's the most mind-boggling public
 health figure I think I've ever heard. But I made a decision then, that I was concerned
 that my bones would long be dust before I could really get answers
 between nutrition and cancer. And so I chose to deal
 with cardiovascular disease, which is the leading killer of women
 and men in Western civilization. And it was quite striking
 that in this global review there were a number of cultures,
 by heritage and tradition, that simply lack
 any cardiovascular disease. They were plant-based. And so with that information
 I came back to Cleveland. And my wife and I decided to go
 on this plant-based diet for a year. And then I asked cardiology
 if I could have about 24 patients, which is the number that I can handle and still carry out
 my surgical obligations. And the 24 patients that I received, were, as my late brother-in-law
 used to say, the walking dead. But they were most cooperative and it was within about, say,
 15 months of starting this program that we had something striking develop. I was treating a 52-year-old gentleman
 who, in addition to his heart disease, had a partially blocked artery
 in his right thigh. And he told me about the fact that when he was crossing the skyway
 to my office, he had to stop five times because of pain in this calf,
 because of this blocked artery. So I had him go to the vascular lab
 and we got his pulse volume. And then I forgot all about his leg,
 so focused on his heart. Eight months later, he said,
 ""Dr. Esselstyn do you recall when I first started seeing you, I had to stop five times crossing
 the skyway here to your office? This last month, it got to be four times,
 then it was three, two, one,"". He said, ""I don't stop anymore,
 the pain is gone"". ""Don, back you go to the vascular lab."" I think if you look here, you can see
 the difference in pulse volume when I first saw him,
 and here we were eight months later, it was now almost two times greater. So the thing that was
 so exciting about this was, in science we had demonstrated
 what we call ""proof of concept."" Not only that, but this occurred one year
 before the invention of the statin drugs. So this was so powerful, because
 it showed us that indeed with nutrition, we can actually not only halt
 this disease, but we could reverse it. And not shortly thereafter, what occurred,
 we saw this now in the heart. This is a 54-year-oold security guard
 where our angiography core laboratory described this as a 30% improvement. But what really got our attention
 was a fellow surgeon at the clinic who, at age 44 in 1996,
 began to get chest pain. He did not have hypertension,
 he did not have diabetes, he did not have a strong family history,
 he was not overweight and cardiology worked him up
 in October of 1996, could find nothing. Three weeks later, he was finishing
 his surgical schedule. Sat down to write
 post-operative orders. Splitting headache, immediately followed
 by this crushing elephant in his chest, pain in his shoulder down his arm. Joe was having a heart attack. Whipped down to the cath lab,
 start the catheterization, cardiac arrest, resuscitate, and finish
 the catheterization. And then he was sent up to the floors and discharged three days later,
 but very depressed. Why? Because what they identified was that his left anterior descending coronary
 artery, in the front of the heart, the entire lower third
 was moth-eaten and diseased, over too long a segment to have stents,
 too far down the artery to have a bypass. So he was very depressed about this, so my wife Anne and I had him out
 to the house with his wife for supper, two weeks after his heart attack. ""Joe you've been eating
 this typical Western diet. You've got the typical Western disease. We've got 10 years of data,
 how about going plant-based?"" ""Okay Ess, I'll give it a shot,
 they couldn't offer me anything else."" He became the absolute personification
 of commitment to plant-based nutrition. And over the next thirty months
 he then had another angiogram. You know, up in the surgical suites,
 our offices are three doors apart. And at noontime of the day
 that I knew earlier that morning he had his follow-up angiogram, I found myself letting myself
 into his office. There he was sitting behind his desk, ""Joe, I understand you had the follow-up
 angiogram this morning, Mind sharing with me, how did it go?"" Got up from around his desk, put his arms
 around me, ""I think we're doing okay."" ""Well, any chance I could see
 the follow-up angiogram?"" ""Yeah!"" It was really quite striking and exciting
 to see what actually can happen; when you give the body
 every opportunity it can. The healing capacity is incredible. So now let's talk a little bit
 about how do you injure the artery in the first place,
 what seems to be going wrong. Now on the right, there is
 a seriously diseased artery. You're probably saying,
 ""That's going to have a heart attack."" No, that only causes
 about 10% of heart attacks, but it certainly will cause chest pain
 and shortness of breath. What I really want you
 to notice is on the left, and here, on the inside of this artery, there's a very, very, tiny, little dark
 single layer of cell ""magic carpet"", that all experts would agree is where
 the inception of this disease occurs. This magic carpet is called
 the endothelium. And the endothelium has an absolutely
 magic molecule that it produces. It's a gas, nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has a number
 of wonderful functions. Nitric oxide keeps
 our blood flowing smoothly like Teflon, rather than velcro. Two, nitric oxide is the strongest
 vasodilator in the body. When you climb stairs,
 the arteries to your heart dilate, the arteries to your legs dilate. Nitric oxide inhibits inflammation
 from the wall of the artery, protect you from getting hypertension,
 and most importantly nitric oxide, in plentiful amounts, will protect you from ever
 developing blockages or plaque. Alright, how do those
 90% of heart attacks occur? You will see here the artery is divided. And what you're looking at
 in the first serial on the left, is that when you start
 eating that cheeseburger, the pizza, the milkshake,
 your blood flow gets sticky. And certain elements
 like your endothelial cells get sticky, your LDL cholesterol gets sticky,
 and then the LDL bad cholesterol migrates into the sub endothelial space, where it sets up this absolute
 cauldron of inflammation. And that cauldron of inflammation
 begins making inflammatory enzymes that gradually begin to thin out
 this delicate cap over the plaque. It gets thinner and thinner
 until it's as thin as a cobweb, and then the sheer force of blood going
 over that thinned out plaque ruptures, and now we have spillage
 of plaque content into the flowing blood, which activates our platelets,
 our clotting factor. Now we are at the beginning
 of a clot, a thrombosis, which is in and of itself,
 self-propagating. So in a matter of minutes, now we have
 an artery that is totally blocked, and all the downstream heart muscle
 has been deprived of oxygen and nutrients and starts to die. That's the heart attack. But there is something absolutely
 magically exciting about this series, because if I can convince you
 that all you have to do is change your nutrition, so your internal biochemistry is such that you will not injure or thin out
 the cap over your plaque, you will actually diminish your plaque, and you will strengthen
 the cap over the plaque. Alright, how do we do this? It's very easy, we avoid the foods
 that injure the endothelium. What are they? Even pure virgin olive oil,
 corn oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil,
 coconut oil, palm oil, dairy. Anything with a mother
 or a face, meat, fish. (Laughter) Meat, fish, chicken, and turkey,
 and also caffeine in coffee, and fructose. Alright what are you going to eat? (Laughter) All those marvellous whole grains
 for your cereal, bread and pasta. 101 different types
 of legumes, vegetables, which are red, yellow,
 and green leafy, and fruit. But especially the green leafy vegetables
 are like water on the fire. What green leafy vegetables? Bok choy, swiss chard, kale, collards,
 collard greens, pink greens, mustard greens, brussels sprouts,
 broccoli, cauliflower, cilantro, parsley, spinach, and arugula
 and I'm out of breath. (Applause) But remember, no oil! (Laughter) Now conventional cardiology, with all those procedures
 and all that expense, is high mortality, high morbidity,
 and sadly it does not cure the disease, and the expense is unsustainable. However, when you're treating causality
 with plant-based nutrition, no mortality with the diet,
 no morbidity with the diet. And what happens with the passage of time,
 the benefits just continue to improve. And lastly nobody has greater fear
 of another heart attack than somebody who's already
 had a heart attack. And how empowering it can be
 for them and their family to know that they themselves can now become the locust of control
 for this disease, destroying it. Whereas in the past,
 it had been trying to destroy them. And that, lastly,
 I want to just share with you, this isn't just
 that original earlier study. But what we're about to publish
 another 200 patients. And the reason we have
 91% compliance is because we have a very strong intense
 single five hour counselling seminar. That's the same amount of time
 the cardiac surgeon has, but I have the patient when they're awake. (Laughter) So how do we do? If we look at the vertical axis, what you're seeing here is the average
 of about three independent cohorts cardiology studies
 that are quite well known. And the recurrent cardiac events,
 after four years, run about 20% on average. Our own, which is called
 ""Treating The Cause,"" is a half of one %, that means
 roughly a 40 fold difference. So in summary,
 it is so exciting what happens when you treat the causation of disease. Because it is not only prompt, it is powerful, and it is persistent. And for those who, in the future, are coming down
 with cardiovascular disease, I hope it is going to be unconscionable
 not to inform them of the power of this option
 from which they can thrive. Thank you. (Applause)"
0,among the first five ingredients you shouldn't find sugar okay now sugar supposed to beat and of course but it should come together with either fat or some element like fiber as you were finding fruit so you can indict you can absorb it a bit more slowly number one so sugar is one of the first five elements in whatever it is you're buying it's a no no no no you want to avoid it okay now even worse than sugar even worse than sugar is this like an appetizing that is that is this is high fructose corn syrup oh that's what it is now it's at it's very sweet yeah but it's not very good for you because it blocks the ability of a chemical called leptin which is the way your fat tells your brain it's exactly okay so you know what this is the thing that's blocking it and so you just keep eating and eating until you literally stops right yeah it's not so much even the hundred and fifty calories in the soda pop it's in fact that at that same meal you will normally consume an extra hundred calories of food and you would have because of this because of this okay high fructose corn syrup okay got that these are both carbohydrates yes the third carbohydrate is this yes this is flour but it's enriched white flour enriched so why would they enriched flour the reason they enriched it is because they already stripped out anything that was worth adorned in it and they add a little bit back so it doesn't look so bad yes it should be whole grain okay wait till has those kernels it has this B vitamins all the things you want to be in there whole grains hip it's in it okay so these three are carbohydrates yes let's move on down to the fun stuff okay now big confusion about fats yeah big this is animal fat yes animal fat is saturated saturated fat is from four-legged animals good if it's coming from a four-legged animal its saturated so that means these things can be solid at room temperature okay large thing card bingo saturated think large good oils good oils our oil our liquids at room temperature repeating so I'm putting it in my brain okay now the thing about good oils is that they're not very stable if you put a good oil into a cracker and try to store it on a shelf it goes bad uh-huh because good oils aren't very stable so in order to deal with that we took the good healthy vegetable oils and we hydrogenated them we added hydrogen's to them okay tell me that again we took good healthy oils okay and in order to make them solid yeah and make them so they wouldn't go bad in a year on a shelf somewhere aha we added hydrogen's to them hydrogen right hydrogen okay makes those flimsy things become rigid and that's what I make it stay on the shelf for a year well it makes it solid at room temperature and solid on a shelf for a year okay and that's this this should be liquid it's obviously not oh this is very good for your skin and you can actually use this kind of material for furniture polish lots of fun things yeah but don't put it in you I can use it on my feet good I'm thinking this is a great moisturizer the bottom of my heel okay and this is what what is this lard no this this is actually a hydrogenated oil okay it's it's a material that is created so that you can keep that stored material on the shelf for a long time here's the big deal when you have healthy oils yeah and you cook with them mm-hmm you oxidize them you damage them so the key thing to know about the healthy oils and what are the healthy oil olive oil sesame seed oil there's they're all the ones that are liquid when they're clack seed oil when they're cold right some are better than others but generally the ones I just listed you know a canola oil flaxseed oil olive oil these are all very healthy oils but because they're healthy they're very delicate yes so you have to store them in the refrigerator or at least cover them so they stay dark otherwise they will they will oxidize they will go bad on you oh really so this stuff is great because doesn't go bad but it's very bad for you okay so the healthy oils if you learn how to use them take you a long way I'll put some on my heels and this is in a lot of things this is the hydrogenated oil correct yes this is hydrogenated to make it solid okay and then by the word that you will see in the package is a trans fat because these hydrogen's bring these molecules together and we call them trans fat so I don't want the thing to say hydrogenated and I don't want it to say trans fat and I don't want it to say saturated exactly you just hit the nail on the head
0,"last week we began a new mini series on understanding how to hear the voice of God very few things are more important than this because you can't have a relationship to God if you can't hear God if all you do is ever talk to him in prayer and you never hear God speak to you that's a one-way relationship that isn't much of a relationship God wants to speak to you now this week I want us to look at the issue of how do I know when it's God when I get an idea in my mind how do I know where that idea came from that impression that thought how do I know it didn't come from the devil or it came from the bad burrito ate last night or it came from my own thoughts I just bought it up I mean you talk to yourself all the time I talked to myself all that I am my own best friend and you're talking you have a running conversation with you throughout the day how do I look how do I feel what's going on how should I handle that respond to that and it's very easy to sometimes be confused on is this God telling me to do this or is this just something I want to do do you know what I'm talking about is this really just my idea or did God give me this idea or did it come to the devil or is it some bad tape that I'm playing in the past it is extremely important you know how to discern when it's God talking to you because if you don't it can be fatal the Bible says this if you take out your message notes on proverbs chapter 14 verse 12 what you think is the right road may lead to death in other words it can be fatal and you know you know a lot of evil gets blamed on God when people say well God told me to do this the Bible says in first John 4:1 don't believe every message you hear just because someone says it's a messy from God test it first to see if it really is circle the phrase test it that's what we're gonna talk about this weekend I want you to learn seven ways to test an impression from the Bible it's a very important and practical message so that you can know how to test a message from God because the fact is one moment you can get an idea from God and the next moment you can get an idea from Satan in a split second let me give you a classic example of it one day Jesus is with his 12 disciples and and he turns to Peter one of the twelve and he says uh Peter who do you say that I am and Peter says well Lord you are the Christ you are the Messiah you were the son of the Living God and Jesus looked straight at Peter and he says right on Pete they said he says you have spoken the truth he said flesh and blood did not reveal this to you in other words Peter that idea didn't come from you that idea came from God he said you're right you spoke the truth I am the son of God and that idea that was put in your mind came from God it wasn't revealed by flesh and blood immediately Jesus says to Peter now Peter I've got to go to Jerusalem and I'm gonna be crucified and I'm gonna die there and Peter immediately says that's nonsense Lord you can't let them do that to you and not five seconds later Jesus looks at Peter and says get behind me Satan what's he saying he said that thought didn't come from God that God thought Peter that you just spoke came from the devil that's how quick you can miss it one minute you can be saying you're right that thought came from God and upon this rock this truth I will build my church and the very next second you're saying something and Jesus looks at says you didn't get that one from God that's the devil because the devil did not want Jesus to die because die and dying on the cross he would die for the sins of mankind and allow our salvation and he didn't want that to happen in that Lane knowing that he said that thought is from the devil now how do you know well he says test it look at the next verse jesus said in John 7:17 anyone who wants to do God's will now that's the key you got to want to be willing to do it in advance anyone who wants to do God's will can test this teaching and know whether it's from God or whether I'm making it up Jesus says you know what you can test what I say and you can then know for sure that it's from God how do you do that well that's what we're gonna look at we're gonna look at seven ways to test an impression now these seven tests form a filter and if you get an idea from God are you getting an idea in your mind you're going now did I just think that up or is that from the devil or is that some old tape that my great grandmother said or something or is that really from the Holy Spirit you test it by these seven tests and if it passes all seven then you can know for certain it's from God now you can't pick and choose you can't say well in that past test one three five and seven but it didn't pass two four and six no no it's got to pass all seven but if an idea that you have passes all seven tests then you can know absolutely certain and God wants you to know this that you have heard from God that God put that idea in your mind and it is something he wants you to do alright let's look at these seven tests from the Bible the first test there's seven questions the first question is does it agree with the Bible does the idea that I've got in my mind right now that thought that impression does it agree with the Bible because God's will will never contradict God's Word what he's already said God doesn't say one thing and then change his mind and say another thing if he said it it's true and it will always be true see God is consistent God isn't moody God doesn't change his mind God will never tell you to violate a principle that he's already given in his word the Bible the Word of God he won't tell you to ignore this book he'll never tell you to disobey this book so the first question you ask is does this line up with what God has already said and if what I have in my mind contradicts something God has already said then I know I'm wrong that it didn't come from God because truth is eternal notice these verses Luke 21:33 Jesus says heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never circle that never pass away God's Word is eternal the earth is an eternal the universe is an eternal but God's Word is eternal because truth never changes if something was true five thousand years ago it was true a thousand years ago it is true today and it will be true five thousand years from today because truth doesn't change opinions change science changes scientific discoveries change I mean the science textbooks out-of-date almost instantly the moment it's who wants to buy last year's you know a computer book it's out of date but God's Word doesn't change and truth never changes in fact if it's new it's not true what do you mean by that I'm saying it's always if it's true it's been around forever we just discovered for instance many years ago we discovered that the world was round prior to that people believed the world was flat now the world was never flat it's always been around it's always been round even when we didn't believe it was around okay it was true whether you believe it or not people say God said it that I believe it that settles it well no God said it that settles it whether you believe it or not because God cannot lie I lie you lie but God cannot lie and so God always tells you the truth and if he told you in this book to do something then he's never gonna contradict it so the first question asked us is this idea in harmony with the Word of God for instance let me give you some examples in the book of Romans the Bible tells us pay your taxes we are commanded as good citizens to pay our taxes and Jesus said render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are gods now if all of a sudden you get an idea God told me to not pay my taxes this year that wasn't God okay that wasn't God because God has already said pay your taxes and he's not gonna contradict it if I go over here to the book of Proverbs there's a bunch of principles for how to have a successful business in the book of Proverbs and one of the principles is God says I bless businesses with integrity businesses that are fair and every business dealing businesses that are just businesses that are honest and so if you get an idea that well you know what I could make a little bit bigger profit this year if I just shaved a little I know it wouldn't be quite right if I was a little dishonest my profits could increase that idea did not come from God because it contradicts what God has already said the Bible tells us that sex is not dirty sex is holy God thought it up it was his idea and God created sex to be the glue between a husband and a wife and many times in Scripture God says sex is to be reserved only for a husband and a wife in the bonds of a marriage now you may not like that but it doesn't make it untrue and you may say well I want to go out and have sex with whoever I want to have sex with well fine but you didn't get that idea from God that's your idea and don't say God told me to go have sex with that person cuz he didn't that's a good pick-up line going to a bar got Oh God told me.your to have sex with me right well that's the god card you don't play the god card in dating okay all right now the Bible says that even if some angel showed up and came along and said oh by the way I've got some new revelation I've got some stuff to add to this book yeah that's good but here's the new stuff this is the new revised and we're gonna update we're gonna give you one or two or more other books besides the Bible God says you know that's not right in fact here's what the Bible says Galatians chapter 1 let God's curse fall on anyone including myself Paul says who preaches any other message even if an angel comes from heaven and preaches any other message says no no the Bible is not enough you got to add this to it you got to add this revelation you got to add this book you add this thought if anybody else adds to it he goes let him be cursed the Bible says this again in Revelation you may not add to what God has already said the second test is when I get an idea I ask does this make me more like Christ does this idea make me more like Christ Jesus is the standard by which I evaluate every thought every idea every philosophy every opinion every fad every opinion I hold it up against Jesus Christ why because God's purpose in your life is to make you like Jesus we've talked about this many times why doesn't God just take you to heaven why did God put you on earth for 80 years and then take you to heaven why doesn't he just create you and take you to heaven why does he put you here on earth for 80 years he ever thought about that I mean you could have just taken you straight to heaven he put you here because life is a test and a trust and a temporary assignment he wants you to practice the things you're gonna do in heaven and he wants you to become like Jesus Christ in character that's gonna involve some problems and going through the things Jesus went through now life is tough everybody agree with that life is hard because nothing works on this planet correctly everything is broken every body is broken every mind is broken every relationship is broken there is nothing perfect there's no perfect marriage no perfect economy no perfect church no perfect country the weather is broken we just saw that this week the environment is broken all because of sin heaven is gonna be the place where we relax and have fun right now God is more interested in your character than your comfort and he wants you to grow up and become like Jesus now look at these verses the Bible says in your lives you must think and act like Jesus Christ God says I is the model and in the next verse we take every thought captive in other words we test every thought we test every thought so it's obedient to Christ so we ask it means when I get an idea the first thing I ask is now what Jesus do this would Jesus think this would Jesus feel this way would Jesus act this way because he's the standard he's the second filter what would Jesus do is a good question it's a good question because I want to be like Christ now God gives a specific checklist because he said well what's Jesus like well he's the fruit of the Spirit God says Jesus is love and he's joy and he's peace and his patience and kindness and gentleness and goodness and meekness and self-control but here's another passage I want us to look at James chapter 3 gives us some things that Jesus is and some things that Jesus isn't and if you get an idea this is a good filter or grid to test the idea if you harbor bitter viii and selfish ambition such wisdom in other words those thoughts those ideas those impressions such quote wisdom that's of the devil you know where those ideas came from the wisdom that comes from God the the ideas the impressions the thoughts that come from God that wisdom is pure its peace-loving its considerate its submissive and full of mercy its impartial and sincere now notice he says here's a test there are two things you can know and ideas not from God and there's seven things you can know it is an idea that is from God it's not God's wisdom and this guy's was first he says it's not an idea from God if it's motivated by bitterness or envy what do you mean by that God says if I get an idea on how to get even with somebody how to get revenge with somebody how to retaliate to somebody and I say you know what that person hurt me how can I get them back oh I know I'm gonna get them good this is a good idea I know how I'll embarrass them I know how I'll hurt them back he says that I didn't come from God that came from the devil that's a satanic idea it's a satanic idea an idea to retaliate to get even to get revenge those ideas do not come from God and then he says also if it's based on envy if I go out say you know what I'm gonna buy this car so people will envy me I'm gonna buy this pair of shoes this shirt I'm gonna buy this dress so people will be jealous of me and they're gonna look at me and they're gonna Envy and be jealous of me God says you didn't get that idea for me it didn't come from me because he says that's from the devil that wisdom comes from Satan and then he says also if it's motivated by selfish ambition he said any idea motivated by selfish ambition does not come from God God doesn't give you self-serving ideas you come up with plenty of them yourself he doesn't have to create them for you you think I'm up all the time and so you know if you say I've got a great idea that just gonna make me filthy rich and everybody's gonna worship me and everybody's gonna be envious of me and jealous of me and I'm gonna be the king of the heap and the top dog and everybody else is gonna be underneath me and I'm gonna be number one God said you didn't get that idea for me selfish ambition God said I didn't put you on earth to bless your selfish ambition that's not what I put you on earth to do to live for yourself see a lot of people try to use God for their own personal ambition and they say well now God told me to do this then that's the Trump how do you how do you Trump God and but where did that come from he says it came from from the devil and he says now if you get an idea and it's from God it's gonna be one of these things pure peace-loving considerate submissive full of mercy you know impartial and sincere so let's look at these first if I get an idea an impression from God is going to be pure so if I get an impure thought that one's obviously did not come from God and it says if I get an idea from God it's gonna be peace-loving what does that mean it means when God gives you an idea it promotes harmony not conflict it promotes reconciliation not division not war not separation God is not going to give you an idea that that to create conflict in your family to create conflict in your small group to create conflict at work to create conflict at church or somewhere else to divide people into this side and that side he says real wisdom is peace-loving jesus said blessed are the peacemakers they are the children of God the people who grow bridges not build walls and in life here either a bridge builder or you're a wall builder he says be peace-loving now what does that mean it means all gossip is satanic it doesn't come from God it's satanic why because the Bible says Satan is the accuser he is the QS er of Christians he is the condemned er of Christians his job is to put you down his job is to condemn you to criticize you when you criticize condemn and gossip about others you're just doing the devil's work for you he says thank you very much all gossip is satanic it's not from God it's not pure it's not peace-loving and number three it's not considerate the third thing I ask is I got this idea would it hurt anybody else would it harm anybody else now if I get an idea and it'll really help me but it hurts everybody else that idea and from God if I get an idea and it's gonna help me but it's gonna hurt everybody else in my family it's gonna hurt my wife and my kids that idea did not come from God it's real simple because wisdom from God is considerate God is concerned about the effects on other people and then it says real wisdom our ideas impressions from God are submissive what does that mean submissive is humble submissive is teachable submissive is willing to have your idea checked by somebody else what do you think when you say to somebody else what do you think about this idea you are submitting that idea to them and so to have an idea from God if it's really from God you're more than willing to say to your small group what do you guys think about this guys if you have an idea and you don't really want to tell your wife about this idea it didn't come from God okay because you're not willing to submit it then what do you think about this honey wives if you get an idea and you don't really want to check it out with your husband like should I buy this well guess what that's not a submissive attitude humble and teachable if an ideas from God the Bible says it is submissive that means you're willing to have it tested what do you guys think and and you ask around and you you know you ask your small group and you know or you ask the people you're working with your staff you say what do you guys think about this idea see when people are prideful and they're unteachable and they are self-righteous it is a dead giveaway that they're not hearing from God because the wisdom of God is pure peace loving considerate and submissive number 5 it says if I get an idea from God an impression from God it's full of mercy what does that mean it means if I get an idea from God it's gonna make me more forgiving of you it's gonna make me more gracious to you I'm thinking man I've been forgiven I better forgive everybody else God has been gracious to me I better be gracious to everybody else I say you know God has cut me an awful lot of slack I better cut my wife an awful lot of slack and my kids an awful lot of slack what because God has been gracious to me true wisdom wisdom that comes from God not human wisdom not demonic wisdom but God's wisdom is full of mercy you know some people this is the the dead giveaway that they haven't heard from God they think they have but they haven't because their attitude proves it when you find people who think they've heard from God and then they're judgmental and they're critical of everybody else and they're harsh and they're accusatory and they're always judging other people and other churches and other leaders and things like that you know they have not heard from God now it just seems that all those people have congregated on the Internet and they have these things called blogs let me tell you something it takes no intelligence to criticize a fool an idiot can criticize anybody a baby can learn to criticize you could teach a monkey how to criticize but it takes maturity and wisdom to find the beauty in every person it's very easy to look at something go she's this she's this he says she's this she's that he's that he's that he's that did you look at all the surface issues and you could instantly think of five things you don't like about them it takes no brains at all to do that what takes intelligence what takes wisdom what takes maturity is to find the good the beautiful in every person and in every situation that takes maturity now it's full of mercy that means you're going to be gracious to other people if it's an idea from God and then it says it's wisdom from God is impartial and sincere now this means you don't use what God tells you to manipulate other people the words insincere and sincere and impartial are actually in Greek the words I decree toasts and an epoch Rito's we get the word hypocrite from a decree tous and an epoch reduce it means hypocrite you know what hypocrite is you wear a mask you're fake you're phony you're not authentic you talk one way with this group and another way with this group when you do that you're not hearing from God if it's an idea it's right out front and it's the same with every person and you don't try to manipulate or control other people if I say well now God told me and then you go well how do you fight with God I mean that's that's like the ultimate weapon the throat well God told me that and you know well okay I guess we better do it no that means if it's really from God you don't do that now tom is going to come and teach us the third filter the third way you test an impression as you asked does my church family confirm it does my church family confirm it you ask other mature believers what do you think about this idea you might check with God's Word might check with the other filters but does my church family confirm it now why is this one so important because you were not meant to live life all alone you were meant to live life in relationship to other people and so you go to others other mature people who are trying to follow Christ as well and you say what do you think about this this is why it's so important that you have a church family listen to what the Bible says about this in Ephesians 3:10 God's intent is that through the church the manifold wisdom of God should be made known through the church God's wisdom is made known into all eternity and each one of us individually he wants to use other people in your life in my life now what does this mean this means that if God has genuinely spoken to you other believers other people who are following Christ are going to confirm it when you talk to them about it oh yeah that makes sense oh yeah I can see that this also means if you get an idea and impression something from God you think maybe I should do this for this area of my life or her a relationship or for my business and you have a resistance to telling anybody else about it that should be a huge red flag I don't want to tell anybody else it's either you know I look at myself I like to think things through and make plans and if I'm resistant in telling somebody else a lot of times just my pride I just want to feel like I made it up all by myself it's either my pride or it could be in the back of your mind you know it's the wrong thing to do and you know what they're gonna say when you tell them so you just don't want to tell them you fret you and test the impression with other people because you realize that they're gonna confirm it if you get some idea crazy idea that you can't find any other person who's trying to follow Christ to confirm it guess what it's wrong so you just throw it out you drop it you realize I'm gonna go on to the next idea if mature believe what I'm saying is this if mature believers question it you should question it too now why does God want us to get advice from other people because he wants to save us from a lot of things next verse in your outline says the wisdom of the righteous can save you now what can it save you it can save you a lot of time waste of time and doing the wrong thing it can save you a lot of pain pain and making a mistake I'd rather learn from somebody else's pain than have the pain myself can you agree with that one no doubt about that it can save you a lot of embarrassment it can even save your reputation sometimes it can save your life that's how important advice from other people can be in your life one of the biggest reasons we mess up our lives is either we have no godly friends no one else in our lives that we can talk to is trying to follow God and live life the kind of way he's made for us to live or I've got some friends but I just won't listen to him in this case I just want to do what I want to do no matter what so I got to build godly relationships into my life now this this is why every one of us we need something our lives you probably know what it is we all need a small group you know this already in fact most of you are in a small group but maybe you were in one and you've gotten out of one you've never been in one and it's just it's the time it's just the hassle it's if you're not in a small group you're skating on thin ice and you don't know where the thin ice is you need some other people in your life that you can bounce some things off of relationships aren't just every once in a while I'll try to call it you got to build them in on a regular basis I can't tell you how many times in our small group someone has said something and I wasn't even thinking to ask him about it but just what they said it caused me to think in a different direction in a different way that's the power of relationships what God wants to do in our lives you need a small group for feedback when it comes to hearing from God impressions from God proverbs 11:14 says in the multitude of counselors there is safety so if you want to make fewer mistakes then you get all the godly advice that you can get and you follow it with one big disclaimer on that one there are some people they've got an idea and they go ask ten people and they realize it's wrong so then they go ask ninety-nine people just looking for one person who will agree with them I'm not saying to do that what you do is you just find some people that are trying to follow Christ trying to live the kind of life God's giving us to live and you ask them and you will allow them to be a part of testing God's impressions in your life now the fourth test is a test that will save you an awful lot of money if you'll really listen to it I have met so many well-meaning Christians who've gone off and started businesses and then they failed and they lost a lot of money from it because they didn't go through this fourth test and they would say well you know it passed the first three I want to start this business agree with the Bible yeah it's not unbiblical does it make me Lauren more like Christ yes I can become more like Christ and starting this business does my small group confirm it and the church family and other mature they say yeah you'd be good at that try that but they didn't really look at the fourth test and the fourth test is this is it consistent with how God shaped me is this idea that I've got this impression this thought is it consistent with how God has shaped me now before you were born God decided what he wanted you to do with your life and then he formed you he shaped you for that specific task he doesn't want you to be somebody you're not he doesn't want you to pretend to be a copy of somebody else he made you to be you we've talked about this often over the years it's called your shape Sh a PE your spiritual gift your heart your abilities your personality and your experiences these are the five things that make you you now this shape determines your significance what you're supposed to form follows function function follows form and the way God formed you determines what your function is the Bible says this in Ephesians 2:10 we are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus to do good works did you know that God created you to do good works why are you here on this earth God created you to do good works and they're unique to you we are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do before you were even born God knew what he wanted you to do so he shaped you for that work the Bible says we're his workmanship that word in Greek is the word puma it means poem we get the word poem from you are God's masterpiece you are God's poem you are God's work of art there's nobody like you quit trying to be somebody else you are God's workmanship he's you are his handicraft and he broke the mold when he made you now your shape reveals your purpose you look at something and you see how its shaped and you know what it's shaped for this right here this is shaped looks like it's shaped to hold stuff music okay this right here I look at this and I see the shape of this is this shape to sit on I don't think so okay no it's shaped to hold this this guitar now I look over there and I see a stool with a big round bottom and I think hmm that would fit my big round bottom okay and I think that is shaped to sit on now I look at this microphone is this shape to sit on no I wouldn't want to sit on that puppy okay so shape determines purpose you are shaped in a certain way God has given you certain abilities and talents if you have a musical ability and you're shaped in music God expects you to use it he never gives you a talent he he wants you to waste now we have 10 different campuses here at Saddleback that means we need lots of musicians both singers and instrumentalists and you should be using that talent for the glory of God on the other hand if you can't carry a tune in a baggie if you're tone-deaf please don't go on American Idol I mean you know in that early stage when they have like the cattle call and thousands of people show up for American Idol you it's very obvious that a lot of those people has nobody who loved them because if they really loved them they would say don't embarrass yourself don't even try okay you're a prison singer you're always behind a few bars you never have the right key okay so so just forget it and obviously they go out there and make a mess of themselves okay now what you're good at is a good indication of what you should do with your life now if you like hanging out with children you love little children or you like working with teenagers then you should be involved in the student ministry and the children's ministry of Saddleback Church because we have thousands of kids and teenagers who desperately need adult mentors they need you and you should be involved at it if you have a passion of heart for them on the other end you say I'm not good with little kids I'm not good with teenagers don't sweat it there's a lot of other things you can do with your life we're all good at different things the Bible says this in Romans 12 six on the back of your outline God has given each of us the ability to do certain things well which implies that there are certain things you don't do well okay nobody is good at everything and that's why we need each other and that's why we need a small group because we we help each other out so in this question you want to ask what am I good at what what do I love to do but more than what I love to do what am I really good at you discover a lot of God's will by something like looking at how God has shaped you now just because you love to do it doesn't mean you should do it many of you know that before I was a pastor I was a worship leader I've played guitar since I was a kid I had a band when I was in in high school and and and I loved to sing the only problem was nobody liked to listen to it so I discovered it just because I I liked the sing doesn't mean I should sing okay so I quickly got wise and shifted gears and when you're doing what you're good at doing people go hey you're good at that okay and then and they will tell you you if you get an impression from God that is totally opposite of what you are shaped to be it didn't come from God you could no it didn't that idea did not come from God it may have been something my parents wanted me to do and I feel pressured to do it because they wanted me to do it or my wife wants me to do it or my husband wants me to do it but I'm not shaped to do it so don't do it because you you're shape determines God's will for your life you know a while back I was invited to speak on the USS Stennis Dennis which is a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier out in the Pacific with 9,000 sailors on it it's a floating city and it was so cool and they invited me out in the Pacific during the middle of wargames so I get on this Cod plane which is a little plane that has a tail hook on it and you co"
0,it's the picture of suburbia identical cookie-cutter homes sitting side-by-side a real-life Pleasantville where working-class mums and dads try to achieve the all-american dream or so you think under this roof in the middle of it all lived a secret depravity the worst of human behavior thinly disguised as one big happy family when you saw Louise's mugshot on TV did you recognize her as as your sister she looks so different you know you can look at someone in their eyes and you can kind of you know see a lot into them you know and with her you can it's just like she was dead inside and she was kind of had like a smirky grin that just that really made me mad on the 14th of January a 17 year old girl rang 911 to have escaped from this house in Paris California the 17 year old said she and her 12 siblings were held captive subjected to repeated abuse torture and starvation by the very people they should have trusted most their parents David and Louise Turpin they began to be tied up first with ropes and then using chains and padlocks what police found behind this closed door is beyond comprehension children chained to their beds others starve too near skin and bone a torture chamber covered in filth and the stench of rotting animals the abuse and severe neglect intensified over time and intensified as they moved to California but according to the person who knew Louise Turpin best her sister Teresa Robinette the horrific truth of this tragic situation can be traced back to a family secret that turned her once naive sibling into a cruel sadistic psychopath the circumstances of her child were pretty grim yeah how much of an impact do you think that's had on this outcome in my heart I feel like a big part of it you hear people say you know sometimes the abuse can't become the abuser but I just I'm so angry with her right now it's hard for me to give her any excuse you know when I think about my house I can still picture it the way it looked when she was alone Teresa and her brother Billy Lambert rarely come back here to their hometown of Princeton West Virginia despite its natural beauty it will always be the birthplace of the cycle of abuse that has forever tormented their family so this is where it all began for you yes where it all started and this is the house that you and Louise were brought up in yeah this looked like a happy home on the outside but inside it was miserable for you then being here now it's sad does it affect memories of love full anxiety hurt they must run very deep okay for Teresa the family home in Princeton is the original house of horrors if ever there was any defense of Louise Turpin's future abusive behavior toward her own children this is it as little girls she and Teresa were repeatedly sexually assaulted by their grandfather and worse still their own mother condoned and encouraged it Louise went through the same thing we went through with my grandfather which was probably the darkest hardest thing for any of us girls to deal with your grandfather abusing them oh yeah my mom would take us to him daily she was pretty much selling us for money to live on and that's how it is I mean I don't like saying it like that it breaks my heart but it is what it is you know I mean that's what it is he was taking it out on his granddaughter's that's almost unbelievable what people don't realize is you know like they did is house of horrors like that's where it all began the family were devout Pentecostal Christians and it was here at this church in the early 1980s that Louise met David Turpin she was barely a teen and he was in his 20s but the two fell in love and as soon as she turned 16 Louise seized an opportunity to escape her recurring nightmare at home by running away with David I used to pick on him all the time and joke with him because it was the deep the nerd the you know and I was like well Louise didn't marry handsome but she married rich she is anything she wants in the space of 15 years David and Louise had eight children raising them with military precision and routinely dressing them in uniform clothing from the outside the terpenes lived a life of wealth and success David was a highly paid engineer and they would fly the family including brother Billy to visit them every year you know we thought that she was she had the perfect life she had the perfect husband we thought that she was happy any time they wanted something they did it you know because we always saw pictures of them going to Disneyland or going to Las Vegas you kind of have to have money to keep going to Las Vegas face to face I thought they were just a normal happy family it's still unclear why but in 1998 something changed in the Turpin household Louise and David completely withdrew not only from their family but also from the outside world they were secretly bankrupt which meant an end to the yearly holidays and in the first of many strange signs they began to home-school all eight of their children Teresa also noticed that kids didn't look quite right there was Skype for a while and we would make comments I remember making the comment that they were all so little I remember Louise laughing it off and well they're just tall gonna be tall and lanky lanky like David you know but they didn't look so they looked healthy they just looked small I'm I think she clothes dim in a way that we couldn't see and I think when the question started she could on visual contact and just talk to us on the phone she was pretty cunning wasn't she yeah she went out of a way to keep it going yeah for a long time didn't you think it was strange and she was homeschooling all those kids yeah and you know her excuse to us was well the crime rates always bad or the kids are getting picked on too much and I don't like I'm feeling you know down on their selves she was committing the biggest crime he was doing the worst of it yeah what no one knew then but we all know now is this pretense of at home education was masking abuse behind closed doors I don't want to alarm people the people that are homeschooled but I mean maybe we could do a little bit more auditing for situations like that maybe we can learn that hey you know why is it that people are homeschooling their kids is it because it's best for the kids or is it because it's best to keep their secrets we've been sleeping in there okay why isn't normal ah can you move that out and open the door sadly in America what happened to the turpin 13 is not an isolated case Jaycee Dugard was 11 years old when in 1991 she was abducted by psychopath Phillip Garrido he repeatedly raped her and held her captive for 18 years the hidden backyard had sheds tents and outbuildings where Jesse and the girls spent most of their lives Alison Jacobs was the police officer who uncovered Garrido's sadistic crimes and says just like the terpenes he got away with the brutality for too long because his victim JC became conditioned to her reality and as frustrating as in law enforcement or anyone if the victims aren't asking for help because if they're not asking for help or giving any kind of clue there's something wrong how is anybody really to know with the turbines it's it's if the kids never said anything was wrong it may be they don't even think anything was how they were growing up that was their normal and they were perfectly fine with it but they conditioned are they from day one yes of course they're conditioned from day one they don't know anything different so why would they ask for help coming up a failed escape the kids horrible existence was almost uncovered when the oldest child plucked up the courage to run away suspicions raised evil is very deceptive it can look good from a surface if you don't get in there too deep but why didn't the neighbors act you two never thought for a moment to pick up the phone that's next on 60 minutes if ever there was a perfect place to hide a secret life from the world Rio Vista Texas is a standout choice rural properties separating neighbors by big yards this is another house of horrors in this sad sordid tale of the Turpin 13 by the year 2000 David Luiz and eight of their kids were living in this home isolated from family who they'd never see in person again behind closed doors their cruelty and severe neglect had well and truly begun to escalate what did you think Darla's couldn't be great our kids are finally gonna have some other kids to play with we're out the country where you know we we're by ourselves and lonely and you know we thought we were gonna have some nice neighbors Ricky and Shelly vineyard and their daughters Ashley and Barbara spent a decade living right across this gravel road from the terpenes in Rio Vista even with distance separating them it was clear there was something disturbing about their new neighbors Ashley would go over there and play them I think that she might have been the only friend that I ever had the other kids would make fun of them because they said they smelled bad they were dirty they had weird haircuts they wear wore weird clothes so at the staad she was allowed to play with him yes until it got weird and then I had to I had to pull her back I had come across two kids out there with Ashley one of the younger girls looked at the older girl and then I know just how wide her hands were at first I was thought they were gloves and I said oh I thought you had gloves on there for a minute and she goes you you wash to the wrist or else you're wasting water and the way she spoke was really you know strange like she might be a little slow she was telling you that she'd been told not to wash past her wrist above the wrist or you were wasting water when the terpenes came here to rural Texas I had eight children by the time they left 10 years later that added another four it was also here that the kids horrible existence was almost uncovered when the eldest child plucked up the courage to run away she was picked up a little way down this road by a neighbor but sadly due to the extreme malnourishment and her lack of education everyone simply thought she was mentally challenged and she was returned to her parents after that happened you started seeing the kids outside again during the daylight and in the evenings and then they'd pull them back in and then after a couple of weeks they withdrew them again you two never thought for a moment to pick up the phone and absolutely bring some thought about it but then again you're out in the country and you mind your own business and you figure they want their business kept to themselves also and you don't realize what you're seeing you know I mean evil is very deceptive I mean it can look good from a surface if you don't get in there too deep by 2010 as David and Louise terpenes secret perversions were beginning to become more obvious in Texas they moved across country to California what they left behind is something Ricky vineyard will never be able to erase from his memory we walked off into the house desks were lined up where they had a little home school they had a giant whiteboard but it the house smelled of funk the all of the the closets had padlocks the refrigerators had padlocks all the cabinets had padlocks everything in the house was locked down they had brand new bikes sitting on the carport and they just sat there and rotted never got played with yeah it was like like mental torture where you put the put the toy in front of a child but you can't play with it where babe it's yeah there were beds they were bunk beds but there there were ropes on the boat bunk beds some of them didn't even have mattresses anymore just looked like the mattresses had rotted there were dead cats while we were waiting through this mess there were rats jumping up I'd like to think I'm fairly clean but man I that right there was disgusting it was the house horror a true house of horrors you know it it was right up under our nose that we did we didn't see it in hindsight then you now think you definitely should have told someone absolutely oh yeah if we if we thought again we'd recognize it for what it is what that is per police officer Alison Jacobs is a missed opportunity to alert authorities to children in danger she should heal she should move on having saved kidnapping victim Jaycee Dugard back in 2009 she believes part of the responsibility lies with neighbors like the vineyards to raise the alarm if there's any fears or doubts it's a fine line and it's a very difficult gray area but it all comes back to not ignoring your gut humans have Graydon's instincts and intuition and we choose to ignore it and I don't know why do you feel a bit guilty now absolutely oh yes absolutely people are so afraid to be wrong if you call on your neighbor because you think something's a little suspicious and if someone follows up nothing's wrong well at least you tried you did your part that's all you can do is your part coming up searching for reasons why you reckon they've found some cult what else would make you do something like that that's just pure evil but a frantic phone call waits to help at last when you go through all the pion and all the rest to have 13 children and then treat them like that that's next on 60 minutes after settling in California in 2010 Louise Turpin now 47 years old gave birth to her and husband David's 13th child the domestic torture chamber was in full flight and even though several of the children were adults all 13 were really allowed out they were often chained to their beds fed once a day bathed once a year and had no communication with the outside world at the same time Teresa Robinette says her sister and David had been pulled into a vortex of new temptations including partying and sexual exploits louisa called me she just told me that her and david had walked away from the church they had been looking into other religions but then eventually they did dabble into witchcraft and i know that for a fact she even talked to me about it cuz i told her that you know that was a scary thing you reckon they found some cult that is something evil it had to be I mean you know because that where else you know what else would make you do something like that that's just pure evil how do you still might the leap from maybe being completely stupid in your private life to torturing and abusing your children see that's what I don't get I knew they were making some wrong choices but I never in a million years would have thought that it had anything to do with danger to the kids in the very early hours of January 14 this year David and Louise terpenes 17 year old daughter finally made a run for it it was an escape she'd been planning for more than two years she called 911 ected phone with the extraordinary story that she and all her siblings had been held captive by her parents she'd never seen a police officer didn't know what a hospital or medication was but her brave act meant finally the 13 prisoners were free neighbors say they are simply in shock seeing that the mother was perplexed as to why we were at that residence how literally lake was froze to my couch I could not believe what I was hearing that's crazy it was like a whole new family like it wasn't even the pit like it was a whole new that everything was a lie like that's the Mel was my first thought you know like everything everything was a lot but all the stories and the conversations and the hours of it was all it was all a lie all 13 victims were severely malnourished and mentally underdeveloped the terpenes 29 year old weighed just thirty seven kilos the 17 year old had the IQ of a first grader I thought they were isolated no friends came over no family came over I just can't understand that it went for so long without being recognized it's almost hard to believe but neighbors living just meters away denied any knowledge of the unfathomable conditions those children were living in for Louise's brother Billy that's something too difficult to accept I'm disappointed at the neighbors one had which said that they were marching in a circle at nighttime upstairs and they saw them in the window to me that seems a little strange right there I mean I would at least go knock on the door and be like is everything okay there was another neighbor that came forward that said two of the older boys were digging in the trash cans at night so to me how is that not a red flag all your nieces and nephews appeared to have been starved psychologically abused most certainly held captive in a various ways do you think your sister Louise is capable that sort of stuff she shocked us that's for sure if found guilty Louise and David Turpin faced 94 years in prison for their sick crimes their 13 children who are currently in the care of the state have already been dealt live sentences dealing with the psychological and emotional damage created by their wicked parents Teresa Robinette and Billy Lambert have only this voicemail from the waves left just two days before her arrest as the final memory of a sister they now say is dead to them when you go through all the pain and all the rest to have 13 children and then treat him like that I have said the same thing and what makes me so mad is you know we would ask her are you gonna have any more kids are you done and she would literally tell us like she wants 20 she don't care if she has 25 she's gonna keep having him till God won't give her anymore and so we can only be eternally grateful that she didn't have 20 oh yeah or 14 your sister has repeated the cycle of abuse hasn't she yes all the abuse together that she went through I think made her mind whatever her mind was um I think it destroyed her self-worth and made her think that that was okay maybe what does justice look like for your sister in my head there is no justice for what she's done to those babies so I really hope they're getting what they deserve in prison and that's just the way I look at it I have no I have absolutely no pity you happy to throw away the key yeah absolutely let them deal with her in there and David hello I'm Liam Bartlett thanks for watching so keep up with the latest from 60 minutes Australia make sure you subscribe to our

0,"So 19 days to go.  Only 19 days to go! So, why'd we do this, why did we decide to quit sugar for a month? Well, nowadays you can't hurl a cronut without hitting a thought-provoking expose on how sugar is destroying humanity one disease at a time and I keep coming across videos and articles of people who lost 80 percent of their body fat, unlock the eighth window to the soul, grew a third eye that only sees truth and became an all-seeing all-knowing space baby at the center of the universe. At this point we pretty much all know that too much sugar isn't good for you.  Too much of anything isn't good for you. Except for WheezyWaiter videos. Haha! Subscribe, like, comment! But I don't want to listen to what some other schlubs said I want to find out for myself and be my own schlub. But why did I want to find out?  Well for one simple reasons. First, I want to live a long time and everyone says sugar causes all sorts of health problems, uh,  heart disease, liver disease, the plague, and I enjoy life and the people in it. I want to see my baby grow up I want to live long enough so that there's the technology to download my consciousness into a computer, and in that way be immortal I want to have more energy, which is apparently what happens to people, 'cause if I have more energy I'm in a better mood.  If I'm in a better mood, I can be more productive and earn that dolla dolla bill y'all and help my baby grow up and purchase the best VR system money can buy. Another reason: I don't like that sugar is hidden in everything. I want to be in control of what I eat. I want to know what I'm eating. Hey, Tony the Tiger. You don't know me. Hey Keebler Elves. You don't know me Hey Frito Bandito. You have a really kick-ass mustache, but you were discontinued in 1971. So you're not relevant here. And finally, I want to know if what everyone's griping about is correct It's fun to tell people when they're wrong And if they're right, it's fun to tell people that think they're wrong that they're wrong The point is it's fun lording knowledge over people. Isn't that what it's all about? Why did my wife want to quit sugar? Let's ask her I guess I wanted to develop some better habits and set a good example for Ada I just resent being addicted to a substance. So what did we do? What are the rules? What does it mean to quit added sugar? Well natural sugar is sugar that's found naturally in food without us doing anything to it. Like apples, milk, vegetables Bruce Campbell one-liners -- -- and added sugar is sugar added to food when we process it That's right, sugar is naturally in Bruce Campbell, it was added to System of a Down, everybody knows that Well, so I'd like to reiterate yogurt It is shocking how much sugar is in popular yogurt brands and it's supposed to be healthy Now here's where it gets tricky apparently natural sugar and added sugar are more or less chemically the same thing but when you have natural sugar in things like Apples it comes with vitamins and fiber and other good stuff that makes the body process it more slowly In a more healthy way and it satiates you and it fills you up more than added sugar But when you take that fruit and you make it into juice even without messing with it in any other way adding other sugar It's still technically natural sugar and will be labeled that way but it loses all the benefits of having it in the fruit and so it's essentially like having added sugar and then there are things like honey and nectar which technically have natural sugar They probably have a little bit more beneficial stuff in them than straight-up sugar But it's still a lot of sugar at once. So with all of that in mind our rules are no added sugar So this means I had to give up my protein bar. I had pretty much everyday no sweet breakfast like pancakes or waffles No donuts ice cream salad dressing ketchup chips and salsa!  Barely any sugar added which why I cheated a few times But don't tell anyone and one more thing nearly every fricking packaged thing in a grocery store So we checked in video style on day nine. Let's see how we were doing The first three days weren't that bad. Yeah, this is true It was pretty easy maybe because we weren't that heavy users of sugar in the first place We have quit drinking soda, and I've reduced my ice cream and chocolate regimen over the years Super good! And I'm only eating it to demonstrate to you how to eat it. I'm not eating it because I need to. I don't like that shot, we should probably do it again. This super good! Yeah, I'm only eating it to demonstrate how to eat So I guess this was gonna be a breeze! Hmm. That's why we started on day 9 I felt too terrible on day 4 excuses excuses Came down with a case of the want-to-dies. Chyna, want to react to how you felt on day 4? That was perfect! So yeah, it wasn't easy. I guess we were gonna feel terrible from that point on Oh yeah, I guess we got over the grumps and everything was gonna be fine. So what was going on here?  Apparently on day 4 we were going through withdrawal, sugar is addictive like drugs Another one!  And another-- So maybe what happened was on day 4 we were going through withdrawal, day 7 we were like Woo hoo! and then finally day 9 was like whoa, whoa, whoa, everyone calm down, life is still hard But so far there was really only one horrible day but that wasn't the worst thing how we felt physically the worst thing was society!  Or to put it less dramatically If I want something quick, but I don't want the same kind of stuff we're having I can't just go to a fast food place and get food during lunch today, and I wanted to just like swing through a drive-thru and grab something to eat Ok, Google is there sugar in McDonald's fries? Okay, Google is there sugar in Wendy's fries? Dang it! Ok, well I'm glad I know that.  They put sugar in everything, why?  Even stuff that doesn't need sugar in it But there were other good things that happened on day nine It's really indicative of how--the sheer volume of sugar calories I was consuming before and I really want to not lose any more.  That--my goal is to like just get more healthy calories in Yes, quitting sugar tends to make people lose weight There could be many reasons but one reason might be this I went grocery shopping with Ada, passed the ice creams and I stopped and looked at like the really fancy ones like the we went to that same grocery store and I looked at those same ice creams and then impulse bought one Cravings for sweets started to go away! Apparently one of the biggest causes of a sweet tooth is a sweet tooth and those cravings never came back not even once! Like a Twix! I think I was drooling. On top of the fridge, I saw those Okay, so the cravings came back a little there were ups and downs, but that's okay as long as we generally just felt better Hmm feel fuller most of the time This was probably the biggest change for me almost all the time I was just kind of full and it was nice But when we were hungry What did we eat? Transition transition Things like apples with natural peanut butter, which I love and I'm completely addicted to --in moderation.  The best peanut butter is, if you can find it at a grocery store, a machine with peanuts in it that you just grind and you get butter!  Peanut butter And quitting added sugar allowed Chyna to get creative. Like lasagna, but the base of it is cauliflower I made a ratatouille and that was pretty good But now I'm a jaded old food critic I saw on like a Facebook video to slice sweet potatoes like long ways spread goat cheese on it and then topped it with blueberries and raspberries and it was so freaking good And finally We planned a glorious celebration. I wanted to celebrate with a strawberries, peanuts, hot fudge on top.  And as I was scooping the hot fudge licked it off the spoon then wait a little while. My heart started racing and I got a little sick to my stomach So I'm just eating strawberries. It's really sweet It's been several weeks since we finished this and I still don't get cravings for ice cream or chocolate or donuts I--anything with sugar. I don't even listen to Suge Knight. I don't even box with Sugar Ray Leonard Is he still alive?  He is still alive.  Good for him So quitting sugar pros and cons.  Pros: feeling full most of the time.  Not crashing, energy levels kind of stayed the same throughout the day Disappointing that it didn't shoot up to superhero levels but it was still nice Fresh food tastes better sweet cravings kind of went away Milk tasted like a milkshake.  Not the kind of milkshake that brought all the boys to the yard but some of the boys We probably saved a lot of money and with all that extra money We made it rain which gave us exercise which was healthy Another pro: more health Probably.  I say probably because you can't really prove the long-term effects of sugar in a month But we did lose weight, which is believed to be healthy in many circles The cons: obviously missing our delicious nomnoms. I love chocolate I love ice cream. Yeah, the cravings went away but isn't life about desire followed by satisfaction I believe it was Nietzsche who said ""Just like want stuff and go get it, or whatever."" That's how life is.  So yeah, denying yourself stuff you love isn't necessarily fun But with time I think you can get over it another con: the terrible withdrawal, which doesn't last forever But the biggest con for me Inconvenience.  Most fast food and most grocery store food is out the window You have to be vigilant about making sure there's no sugar in stuff You can't just go out and eat wherever whenever One inconvenient thing that happened We visited my parents and my mom made my favorite meal of all time is her spaghetti with her homemade sauce It has sugar in it. We had to bring our own sauce. And that's cool, my mom was fine with it And we washed it done with Yoo-hoo. There it is, this is what quitting added sugar did for us Turns out I concur with most other people who did this and say that quitting added sugar did some good things Good job other people And then I mostly just felt normal But I'm eating less than I was before so that's good. I think it was worth it, ultimately If you want to do it I say go for it, but you don't have to just jump right into it No, you don't have to No, Phil! You could just start by looking at food labels and learning about how much hidden added sugar there is everywhere Or, just do what you do. You're a beautiful snowflake. And I know you can do it, whatever that is One thing you can do if you like this video is click the like button or you can subscribe.  If you do you may see more month-long challenges like this. I may go vegan for a month. I may go streaking for a month I'm not gonna go streaking for a month In my previous video I analyzed why people liked haul videos and I plan to do more analyses like that and I'm doing a secret week daily vlog videos every weekday for patrons if you want to support me on Patreon Thank you for watching and thank you for being you Unless you're a jerk, maybe work on that"

 Reviewer: Mile Živković Hello, brains! I say that to you
 because, if you think about it, it wasn't really you that decided
 to come here today. It was your brain. And whether you decided to walk,
 or drive, take a taxi, or ride a bike, that decision was made by your brain. Behavior, all behavior,
 is affected by the brain. This is a story about my brain. So, I was a smart kid. By 18 months, I was speaking
 in full sentences. By third grade, I was scoring
 post-high school on standardized tests. I had, as all my teachers agreed,
 so much potential. I was also struggling. I didn't have many, any, friends outside of books. I was easily overwhelmed.
 I spaced out in class. I lost things constantly. And trying to get my brain to focus
 on anything I wasn't excited about was like trying to nail jello to the wall. But I was smart, so nobody was worried. It wasn't until middle school, when I was responsible
 for getting myself to classes on time and remembering to bring
 my own homework, that being smart wasn't enough anymore,
 and my grades started to suffer. My mom took me to the doctor
 and, after a comprehensive evaluation, I was diagnosed with 
 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD. If you're not familiar with ADHD,
 it has three primary characteristics: inattention, impulsivity, 
 and hyperactivity. Some people with ADHD have more
 of the inattentive presentation. Those are the daydreamers,
 the space cadets. Some have more of the
 hyperactive-impulsive presentation. Those are the kids
 that usually get diagnosed early. (Laughter) But the most common presentation
 is a combination of both. (Laughter) My doctor and my parents decided
 that, given my shiny, new diagnosis, maybe stimulant medication would succeed
 where spankings and lectures had failed. So I tried it, and it worked. The first time I took my medication, it was like putting on glasses and realizing I could see
 without squinting. I could focus. And without changing anything,
 my GPA went up a full point. Honestly, it was kind of miraculous. By 14, I had friends that liked me. By 15, I had published my first poem. I got a boyfriend. By 17, I knew I wanted to be a journalist. My local college had a program
 that would guarantee admission to USC. They had a really great 
 journalism program. So, I signed up at my local college
 and I started taking classes. I moved in with my boyfriend. Things were going great, until they weren't. I started having trouble
 making it to class on time. I aced a statistics course, but I forgot to sign up in time,
 so I never got the credit. I took classes so I could help
 my boyfriend with his career, but I completely lost sight of mine. I never made it to USC. By 21, I dropped out of college
 and moved back home. Over the next ten years, I started
 and quit, or was fired from, 15 jobs. I ruined my credit. I got married, and was divorced within a year. At this point, I was 32, and I had no idea
 what I was doing with my life, besides reading self-help books
 that didn't seem to be helping. What happened to all that potential? Was I not trying? No!
 I worked harder than anyone I knew. I didn't even have time for friends. I was that busy. I had potential, though. So, my failure was clearly my fault. I just hadn't done
 what I need to do to reach it, and, honestly, I was tired of trying, putting more effort into life
 than everyone else and falling farther and farther behind. At this point, I could
 have given up on myself, I could have decided that everyone
 who'd thought I had potential was wrong. But I didn't, because I knew that it was my behavior
 that had gotten me here, and behavior is affected by the brain, and my brain has ADHD. Looking at my behavior, I knew: even with medication, even as an adult, my ADHD was still
 interfering with my life, and what I needed to know was how and why, and, more importantly,
 what could I do about it. I started to do some research, and I found a lot of great information. I found a lot of bad information too,
 but that's another talk. But there's good information out there. Websites, podcasts, talks,
 by researchers and medical professionals; books that would have been 
 way more helpful than the self-help books I'd been using
 that were clearly written for normal - well, there's no normal -
 neurotypical brains. A lot of what I found, though,
 was either super technical or seemed like it was written
 for parents and teachers trying to deal with ADHD kids. There wasn't a lot
 that seemed intended for us, the people who have ADHD. So, I started a YouTube channel. I had no idea how to start
 a YouTube channel, but I started a YouTube channel. I almost called it ""How Not To ADHD,"" because that was about all
 I knew at the time. But my boyfriend, Edward,
 talked me out of it. It turns out lots of people
 need help understanding ADHD, including, maybe especially,
 those who actually have it. I was no exception. I thought ADHD was
 kind of the same for everybody. I thought it was mostly
 about getting distracted. I thought having ADHD was maybe
 the reason that I was failing at life. And I thought I was what needed to change,
 in order to be successful. I couldn't be successful and still be me. Spoilers: I was wrong. So, let's go back for a second, let's
 go back to what brought us here today: the brain. Understanding the brain you're working
 with, it turns out, is kind of important, and that's true whether that brain
 is your employee's, your student's, your kid's, your significant other's, or your own. ADHD affects between 5 and 8%
 of the global population, which means, statistically speaking, there's between 37 and 60 of us
 just in this room. You can't tell who we are just by looking,
 but it's fun to watch you try. (Laughter) So, at some point, you're going to meet
 someone with ADHD, work with them, give birth to them, or fall in love with them. Chances are you already have. And, at some point,
 you're going to ask yourself, ""What is going on in their brain?!"" So, after two years of learning about ADHD
 and a lifetime of experience with it, after having the honor of connecting
 with researchers, and doctors, and ADHD experts, and tens of thousands
 of ADHD brains all over the world, what can I tell you to help you
 understand ADHD? By the way, many of them
 helped with this talk. First of all, it's real. It's not bad parenting
 or lack of discipline. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It's currently the most
 well-researched mental condition, and there are actually
 measurable differences in the brain. These differences are larger in children,
 but, for most people, they never go away. In other words, adults have ADHD too. While rates of ADHD diagnosis
 are increasing, it's not because of an increase
 in sugar or technology, or lack of spanking; it's not, any more than people drowning in swimming
 pools is because of Nicolas Cage. Correlation does not equal causation. Those are real numbers. (Laughter) It's from both an increase
 in understanding that ADHD exists, that girls, adults, and gifted
 students can have it too, and ironically a lack of understanding that being hyper, misbehaving,
 or struggling in school does not mean you have ADHD. ADHD is more serious than I realized. The primary characteristics - inattention,
 impulsivity, and hyperactivity - don't sound all that serious,
 and I didn't think that they were, but, in real life, they translate
 to people getting into more accidents, being more likely
 to get fired, get divorced, significantly more likely
 to struggle with addiction. I learned that ADHD is on a spectrum. Raise your hand
 if you've ever lost your keys, or spaced out in the middle of a lecture. If you're not raising your hand, I'm going to assume you spaced out
 in the middle of this one. (Laughter) The thing is, while everyone experiences
 ADHD symptoms sometimes, an actual diagnosis is based
 on how many of those symptoms significantly and chronically impair
 multiple aspects of your life. Just like you can get sad
 and not have depression, you can get distracted and not have ADHD. And just like you can have
 mild depression or severe depression, ADHD can range from mild to severe. I also learned ADHD
 is a terrible name for ADHD. It creates a lot of confusion. We don't have a deficit of attention! What we have trouble with
 is regulating our attention. As ADHD coach Brett Thornhill puts it, it's like your brain keeps switching
 between 30 different channels and somebody else has the remote. Sometimes we have trouble focusing at all, and other times we get stuck on a channel
 and can't pull ourselves away, which in real life might seem
 we don't want to do homework because we'd rather play video games,
 and short, sometimes that's the case. But the truth is there are plenty of times
 we want to able to focus, we try, and we just can't. Current understanding
 is that this difficulty has to do with the way our brains produce
 and metabolize neurotransmitters, like dopamine and norepinephrine. I learned ADHD is highly treatable. Stimulant medication boosts
 these neurotransmitters, which is why it helps us focus. It's very effective for around 80%
 of people with ADHD. And I learned that 
 medication isn't enough. ADHD affects much more than our focus. It impairs executive functions
 like planning, prioritizing, and our ability to sustain
 effort toward a goal. It affects our ability to regulate
 our emotions, our behavior, our sleep. It's not one program in our brain
 that works differently; it's the whole operating system. It can affect every aspect of our lives. And there are a ton of strategies
 out there that can help. Cognitive behavioral therapy, coaching,
 even meditation or regular exercise can help make a huge difference
 understanding your brain. I knew I had trouble focusing,
 and I knew my medication helped with that. What I didn't know was that getting
 overwhelmed all the time had to do with poor working memory,
 and that making lists helps; or that the reason I ran late all the
 time wasn't because I didn't care, it's because ADHD'ers
 have a skewed sense of time, and that using a timer could teach me
 how long things actually take. Mostly, I expected to learn
 what I actually learned: that ADHD is real; addressing it is important; and medication is not enough. What I didn't expect to learn: that I wasn't alone; I had an ADHD tribe; what a difference it would make
 to connect with it. There are people with ADHD
 in every country, every culture across the globe. Yes, even in France. (Laughter) And this tribe is awesome. Comparing myself to people
 with neurotypical brains, I felt really bad about myself. Why couldn't I keep my house clean
 or finish a project in time, instead of waiting
 till the very last second? But seeing the positives
 in fellow ADHD brains helped me recognize
 and appreciate my own strengths, ones I couldn't see when I was
 just staring at my weaknesses, which is what I'd been doing for decades. But ADHD brains have
 a lot to offer the world. We tend to be generous, funny, creative. ADHD'ers are 300% more likely
 to start their own business. We not only think outside the box; we're often not even aware
 that there is a box. (Laughter) We may struggle when
 our brains aren't engaged, but ADHD brains are great
 at tackling tasks that are urgent, working with ideas that are new, wrestling with problems
 that are challenging, and dedicating themselves to projects
 that are of personal interest. This YouTube career I'd stumbled into
 was all of those things. At 32, I was divorced, miserable, and had no idea
 what I was doing with my life. At 33, I'd started my own business,
 and was connecting with ADHD experts. By now, at 34, I have a team of volunteers
 helping with the channel. I'm engaged to this amazing man
 who helps me produce the channel, works right alongside with me,
 is doing the slides right now - and, as we discovered, also has ADHD. (Laughter) I'm working on reaching out to schools so that kids don't have
 to wait until they're 32 to learn about their brains. And I'm doing my very first TEDx talk
 here with you today. (Cheers) (Applause) But wait! There's more! Wait. (Applause) That did sound like the end
 of the speech. I'm sorry, it's not. (Laughter) I'm happier and more successful
 than I've ever been in my life. So, what happened?
 How did I reach my potential? Three things: one, I learned
 about my brain, my ADHD brain, both on my own and by connecting
 with others who have it. If you judge a fish
 by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life
 believing it is stupid, unless it happens to chat 
 with another fish and realizes fish aren't great
 at climbing trees, and that's okay, there's plenty of ocean. Two, in learning about my brain, I found and stumbled
 into a job that engages it. If you spend all your time trying
 to get a fish to able to climb a tree, you'll never see how far it can swim. It turns out I can be me
 and still be successful. I just had to find my ocean. Three, I learned strategies
 for challenges I still face. I have no fish analogy
 for this one, I'm sorry. (Laughter) I guess I learned how to swim. Once you know what
 your brain's challenges are, you can find solutions to them. Once you look past the stereotypes
 and assumptions about people with ADHD, and dig deeper, you learn
 what ADHD actually is. It's not people who won't stop fidgeting,
 or getting distracted. It is brains that are
 chronically underaroused, trying to get the basic level
 of stimulation all brains need. It's not about procrastinating
 or not caring. It's having executive function deficits
 that make it hard to get started. And it's not people being lazy
 or not trying enough. It's kids and adults struggling to succeed with a brain that doesn't always
 want to cooperate in a society that wasn't built for them. Society is our user's manual. We learn how our brains and bodies work
 by watching those around us. And, when yours works differently,
 it can feel like you're broken. So, what I'm trying to do
 is reach out to these people wherever they are
 in the world, and tell them, ""You are not weird. You are not stupid. You do not need to try harder.
 You are not a failed version of normal. You are different, you are beautiful, and you are not alone."" If you don't ADHD yourself, chances are
 you know somebody who does. They're your employee, your boss,
 your friend, they're in this room. I hope this talk helps you
 understand them better. If you do have ADHD, welcome to the tribe. (Applause) (Cheers)"
0,afternoon I have several announcements every doctor every hospital every nurse have been notified every woman in this country must be aware that it's most important that they check their medicine cabinet that they do not take this drug in the early 1960s no drugs struck more fear into the hearts of pregnant women one of the most horrifying episodes in medical history then thalidomide it changed our relationship with the drugs we use one reason u.s. drug laws are so strict solidified and became an example of what many saw as corporate greed at its worst British falooda my children so far have not received any compensation from the rich company that made the drug which crippled them so brutally but this dark chapter is only part of thalidomide enigmatic story one that continues to reverberate today I had used up every other alternative when I took the lead on I in 1960 a new wonder drug was slated to arrive on American shores a sedative that was said to also treat a range of other ills a hypnotic as the doctors call it that was the answer to a prayer its generic name was fully divided the hallmark defining quality of the lid amide was its safety so saved that in Germany there was no prescription needed the German company that developed fill an amide chemi Grune in Thal claimed that even pregnant women could take it the drug company had handed out samples of this drug all over the place starting with employees of its own company on Christmas Day in 1956 a baby girl was born in Germany without ears and she was the daughter of an employee of the drug company Grune and the home no immediate connection was made to filete imide which soon sold nearly as well as aspirin in some European countries we received it in quantities like a thousand pills who had tremendous pressure all over the world to get this wonderful new drug on the market they had 2 million tablets ready to go the moment the FDA approved the drug which was almost a foregone conclusion until one doctor came along and began working at the FDA it just so happened that my first application was for the drug thalidomide I got this because I was new and they thought I should have an easy one to start on but dr. Kelsey was uneasy with what she saw as the lack of rigorous scientific studies and the slipshod presentation of safety data provided by GRU Ninh Thal and William s Merrill the u.s. distributor of the drug the best thing that could be said about solidified at the time was simply that you could not kill a rat no matter how much solid amide the rat ate with thalidomide being prescribed for morning sickness in other countries Kelsey became particularly concerned with what effect it might have on a developing fetus in June of 1961 an article appeared promoting its safety during late pregnancy it was allegedly written by a dr. Rehn Olsen but in fact the article was written by the medical director of the drug company about six months later long ignored evidence became public in Germany linking filete imide to a rash of birth defects although hundreds of thousands of pre market samples had been provided to American doctors dr. Kelsey stubborn delay of the drugs approval for more than a year had prevented a similar scale of tragedy from unfolding in the United States dr. Kelsey was absolutely a unique hero in American history but thalidomide 's reach continued to be felt across the rest of the world including in trinidad and tobago where Gisele Cole was born when I came along I'm a first born and they were young married couple I mean I was never unloved or not wanted or anything like that but I would be foolish to think that it was easy for them my disability is the official term is folk Amelia I'm coming from the Greek being shorter arms or flipper Lake I think people always expect that I would have been angry and I'm certainly not angry never have been long discussed but seldom implemented major regulatory reforms were finally forced on the pharmaceutical industry following the thalidomide scandal for some time President Kennedy has tried to get Congress to approve new control but without much success now with the thalidomide scare most of the opposition is melted largely the same FDA guidelines that we live under today were created in the immediate wake these regulations were too late for the lid amides thousands of surviving victims across the world who soon became the story Phillipa Brad Bourne is one example her mother rejected her ten year old called Davies leaves a relatively normal life for a boy without arms one other young mother her husband her sister and her doctor are charged with the mercy killing of her deformed infant I'm one of the lucky ones in that my parents were adamant that I was their daughter and their daughter first before anything else and it was treated as such many were put in homes because they just didn't know what to do some families battled with doctors to have amputation of fingers and toes and whatnot to accommodate these prosthetics many families were broken irrevocably instead of quickly settling the drug companies dug in with Grune and Thal originally arguing that the children's deformities were caused by everything from nuclear fallout to botched home abortions anything but the lid imide it was a very long difficult process most cases were eventually settled but litigation continues with some survivors saying the original settlements cannot cover the cost of their specialized care Grune and Thal didn't apologize to its victims until 2012 50 years after the tragedy unfolded they issued a statement saying that just a human the 50 years to come forward to say anything because they were shocked they don't have a right to be shocked the shock doesn't belong to them despite all that the lid amides victims endured over the decades they could long take solace in one simple fact salud amide is now banned everywhere the now ban elyda mod the drug was banned in 1962 and I would have liked to have seen it never used again there's a tremendous amount of luck in science it's almost like an Easter egg hunt in 1992 while conducting research into macular degeneration ophthalmologist Robert D'Amato began his own hunt this one to find a pill that might restrict blood vessel growth I started searching for drugs that cause some sort of damage to a fetus a birth defect and at the top of this list was Saluda my although thalidomide had been banned around the world unbeknownst to many the drug was later made available for limited humanitarian use thanks to a chance discovery in 1964 a doctor in Jerusalem was taking care of a patient who had such severe leprosy that he was in pain and couldn't sleep he decided to treat the patient with fluid my to see if it would help with the sleep and began to notice that there was also improvements generally in the leprosy after much trial and error dr. D'Amato finally had a similar breakthrough when he demonstrated that thalidomide could starve blood flow to cells a discovery that held the potential for treating cancerous tumors the people that really understood the results were excited because we had a tool that we didn't have before but the knee-jerk reaction was this is a dangerous drug know whatever want to use it there was thousands of victims that still remain there had been a promise that foot imide would never be developed again we had to make a decision what position we were going to take many would have thought and expected that we would have been screaming no no no no no but following a surge of reports about promising studies that's not what happened yeah nervous we're of course frightened and dismayed but we realized that this is not a perfect world falooda mite is back the Food and Drug Administration says the litter mite will be the most restricted drug ever distributed female patients taking the drug will even have to submit to pregnancy tests since then the lid amide has gone on to combat a surprising variety of diseases from tuberculosis and Crohn's disease to multiple sclerosis and symptoms of HIV and AIDS and d'amato's hunch about the drugs effect on cancerous tumors paid off in a groundbreaking treatment for certain types of a disease slit mine and its derivatives have become the primary treatment for multiple myeloma it's a very fine line that I walk in many of us walk when we think about balloon ride in today's world clearly you can see what it has done to the thousands of us who are still on this earth but if it provides some kind of assistance help relief of suffering then I cannot in good conscience be a post Brenner who saw thalidomide curative powers firsthand after being prescribed it for a deadly skin disease says that the drug circuitous history tells us a great deal about the accidental nature of drug discovery it's kind of surprising I think to most people to learn that drugs are in fact developed and then become as they're called a drug in search of a disease when you have a drug that has a powerful activity whether it's negative or not that powerful activity could be used for something something good if you could figure out what that was but for all its benefits the scientific rehabilitation of Follette imide has come with a heavy cost we were told this could never happen again in Brazil where the drug is used extensively to treat leprosy researchers report that the lid amide children continue to be born as many as 100 since 2005 by one recent estimate fifty years down the road I would like to think that there's no such thing fiddling light that we have created something we have developed something that would allow us to bury the little I'd literally destroy it get rid of it so that there are no further discussions other than a node in history
0,"I don't know, like are you not jealous? Because I don't want to share my partner at all. I have my polyamorous people on the left spotlight, and my monogamous people on the right spotlight. Walk forward if you agree, stay there if you disagree. ""Humans are naturally polyamorous."" The way I think of myself as ""polyamorous"" is even more broad than sexuality, and it's just simply like— you know, I can see the beauty in and adore, and love qualities of an infinite number of people if I just recognize myself in another person. Yeah! We don't just love one kid, we love multiple children. We don't just love one friend. Maybe we don't love just one job! We're in LA Hell, we probably up to 12 jobs amongst the 3 of us here How many people have gotten divorced, and... remarried? And it's like, ""Oh, I'm on my fourth marriage."" You know like how does that work out? It's like... How is it— That's really— sorry to interrupt, but, that that is kind of like polyamory over time, actually. It's just a circle non-ending, when you could have just been true to yourself, and had those multiple relationships whether... they had a piece of paper or not. I understand that a lot of marriages fail, but at the same time I feel like a lot of people don't put in the effort that they should. If people are willing to try and do the best that they can, and try to be the best for this one person... it can definitely work. A lot of people in polyamory... want to use the 'divorce' example as a reason for why they're polyamorous, and they understand, but, at the same time it's— you can't really know until you try it. And a lot of people that are monogamous think that polyamory is just all sex You know? I've been with the same guy for... six years, and I've never felt like I needed to be with someone else. And if I did I would have just— left him? As bad as that sounds. I just can't imagine like... feeling equally for two people. We have to be equal though It doesn't— No Usually you like, I mean for lack of better words, like rank your partner's. Like— You have a primary partner, so, in most, even in polyamorous relationships... I'm in an open relationship not polyamorous— Which isn't about just sex— But, it isn't... I do have a primary partner, who I live with, and who I spend time with, and I share bills with, and I share a family with. And then I have other partners— Maybe who I share... dinner and drinks with, or we have a similar career interest, and someone would just love making out with. So I think that there are... Yes, there's compartmentalized ways— and there are people who do have two equal partners, I think that's probably the minority versus the majority. Okay Just like the monogamous relationships— nobody's marriage is the same. That's what you make it, it's the boundaries you make. It's your relationship, it's not nobody else's relationship. I gotta high five you on that one! Took the church right there! ""I am in love"" Because, I had to think about how I'm answering that question. I was thinking about someone... outside of myself. And... it occurred to me that I can answer this question in a different way— And that's been a very big theme in my life. The last few years, coming out of a divorce in a monogamous marriage, um, 20 years of monogamous relationships, and And the theme of my life for— for myself right now is finding love with myself, and being in love with myself. I feel like throughout my relationships, I have found a lot of love for myself. Like all of the girls that I have dated and my girlfriend now, currently, like— have all taught me so many things. I feel like that's one of the main things in that relationship— like you love someone so much and then you learn from them, and they learn from you, and you guys grow together. It was just like, a beautiful thing? My name is Alevtina, but I go by ""Alia"" and, honestly as a person— I don't think I would be able to give someone what they want and what they need in a relationship if I had more than one partner. I've been married for two years, and, um— But I've been with my wife for over eight years, and she was my only girlfriend, so— Uh, it's about is monogamous as it gets. Yeah, but very much still in love. Um, yeah, I love her more every day. In a weird way, my relationship... it allowed me to love myself more. When I was with someone who totally accepted all parts of me— who was like, ""Be that, it's beautiful!"" ""It's sexy!""— It allowed me to love myself more Is it's complete acceptance for me, and my decisions. There is no, ""Well you can't do this,"" or ""Well your urges are bad,"" or ""This is bad about you."" It's ""Be who you want to be, let's talk about it."" I actually read about uh... polyamory, like when I was in my early 20's. I remember reading about it and I'm like, ""This sounds so.."" like, something about it was— something that resonated with me I just didn't realize it was that much of an option. I didn't see much of a model in society. I thought well, ""Even if I want that how would I find someone else who's into the same things I am?"" And in the last couple years I've been really just saying like, ""I need to explore this— I need to find community."" I'm not someone who says ""I don't believe in monogamy."" As a matter of fact, having a chance to really explore both... sides has given me an understanding, an appreciation for both and also understanding the limitations of both for myself. ""There is a good reason why most people are monogamous."" I don't know, like are you not jealous? Because I feel like that's the main reason why I wouldn't be able to do that. Because I don't want to share my partner at all. Yeah, I don't share— it's like I am with you, and you're with me And you know we're together and we're growing and if you don't want me anymore And you want to go explore other things go and explore them, but on your own You know I think that's crazy. Just because in every other area in our life you have to control jealousy jealousy is not a Attribute to be proud of to say I'm a jealous person like if you're at work You can't be a jealous person function well at the office you can't function well in your family or With your friends as a jealous person, and so why in this one area of your life Do you say this is where I get to be the person that I can't be anywhere else? The idea of jealousy of I'm afraid because I've put so much it's kind of like the slot-machine approach I've sat at this machine. I put in so many quarters I want to you know get reap the benefits, but if this is someone that you love Does that extend to that if he said this is someone that I think might be a better fit? If my husband said I found a different person that I want to be with and she's fulfilling a need that you Don't or can't then I'd be like okay. Go be happy with her like it's not natural for me to be like okay Let's the three of us work this out and to me that jealousy is just rooted in the fact that you're completely intimate you've made a commitment to each other and This is the person that is basically like your second half having that jealousy for your significant other is beautiful and in a way I think monogamy is a practical choice because it's Safer sexually one - it's probably a lot simpler, and it's it's prepackaged I mean it's like here's a set of rules that has been created for you hundreds of years ago Here's what love looks like and if that feels comfortable for you. It's easy but Monogamy isn't easy you know monogamy is hard like being with someone and being with them for 10 15 50 years It's very hard you have to find ways to love your partner for Truly who they are all the good and all the bad And you don't have someone else to turn to when you want something new you have to find it in your relationship You have to find a way to spice things up you have to find a way of making Conversation where you know everything about each other? Why don't we have one friend? Why not just one friend why do you need multiple friends at all I mean most of us probably have 10 friends 20 friends 5,000 Facebook friends why why not just have one Facebook friend because You don't build such a strong connection with? A friend you build a strong connection with a partner because a partner gets to know everything and every single thing will be because There's different levels of friendship but Like when you're in the relationship with someone you explore so many more things in so many different facets of your day because at some point you will move in together and You know you'll see what everyone does like day to night, and you'll get to know everything about them You don't really get that with one friend I do have like a best friend, right But the reason he's my best friend is because he's different than every other friend I have and if I have something really really serious really really important I'm going to him first, but you still have other friends sure and I equate that to What she was saying earlier about having a primary partner for example? You know you could have a primary partner that you have intimacy that you live with you have sex with and you may have Like let's let's equate that to your best friend, and then there could be someone else that you hang out And you play baseball with you do other activities with you know and I could have another person we make music together and we do things and yeah when we have sex once in a while - It's interesting that you know I think from the traditional model the fact that I would have any physical Connection with this other person is what distinguishes it as a issue If my partner wanted me to I would consider going to the other side Oh I was monogamous for a lot of my life, and that was For you know the reasons that were felt authentic to me at the time, and I've been Non-monogamous for some time now, which has been authentic for me for this time and I think that for me the important thing is always keeping an open mind and Realizing that life is constantly evolving I think one of the things I Disliked about monogamy when I was in monogamous relationship is all of the you need to or you should or That we have a pre-arranged agreement of what loving each other means And if you don't obey that it's over and I wanted to give my partner a true open Experience and so if I'm gonna say to you it can't be monogamous well How is it really open because there is a condition on there of like well? This is the only way? This is going to work, so it's always open to me means open for discussion Can I jump in and what you said about like loving and you know fully accepting someone I just know that I as a person wouldn't be able to be in the polyamorous relationship and keep myself happy so if my partner were to suggest I would say you know, I don't think I'm capable of doing that and I would still love them I would support them. I would want to be friends with them I would want them to be as happy as they can be even if that doesn't involve me in their life I think what the strength that non-monogamy has over monogamy is that we're saying who are you who am I? Let's figure out something that makes sense for us versus this is what I was told love is let's try and do that thing I don't feel like I live that way because someone told me to I just Don't have the want To add other people and if you if you don't have that desire yes, authentic to you yeah And I think that so many people on this earth have the desire and they think they don't have the option My name is Jasmine. I actually married my very first boyfriend. We just eloped and we got married about two years ago we've been together ever since a Good sex life is necessary for a good relationship If sex dies from the relationship and your love and lust for each other kind of dies Then you might be better off as friends and partners as friends Sex is so much more than just physical that it makes a big impact in How I feel in my relationship if I don't have sex I'm gonna feel like Disconnected like there's something off in our relationship ultimately. I mean I talk about sex for a living It's a big part of my life It's a big part of my reset if I'm gonna have a sex would you undo it myself like I really enjoy it orgasm has Ridiculous amounts of health benefits, and it just feels great, so I love the physicality of it But I also think that every person should like really define one of the top five things you have to have in a Relationship and for a lot of people sex doesn't hit that top five and if it doesn't that's okay You know you can still make a relationship work without sex being a priority, but if you're someone like myself you can't I'm in the same boat with you like I've always been a very like sexually driven person An explorative person and and all pretty much all the monogamous relationships I was in I had never found someone that would say matched my kink so having a partner That's like really on the same page with me as Explorative and open as I am is really like Pretty much at like the top one or two things that I would say in a relationship for me Success and everything in life If the sexual tension is there awesome But what happens up to the sex and the sexual tensions is gone like Was that it was just sex the sexual tension dies out it is kind of it can But that's the whole point of like where people have to rekindle it and they have to try new things and they have to See what works to make the spark come up again because after we spend so much time with someone and you know them so well It can get lost, but it's a continuous effort of trying to make your sex life The best that can be even an anonymous relationship you still have to do that like I don't think it's healthy to like you to run out and look for other things just because My primary relationship is like not working like it's still me you know that's that Relationship still needs work every relationship needs work. I think Like sex is important. I mean I could just think of all the things that sometimes like sex can just cure your relationship And I don't know what it's like to you know have a terrible sex life, so I guess take this with a grain of salt But you know I don't think I think about the amount of time you spend with your Partner right compare that to the amount of time you have sex with them. I think a Lot a lot more happens Besides sex and a relationship is I mean it's like how much fun you have like the intimacy you share conversations Everything right you know making sex not just about sex like it's about connecting to people so it's there's someone right so I think it'll feel like it's a Space it's a really amazing space to like to explore that connection in the closest physical way you possibly can I feel like if sex was your first like priority. You wouldn't really be in relationships You would be finding sexual partners that fit you, but you wouldn't really care about anything else So I feel like sex plays a big role but also we're You know we're puzzles like we have so many pieces and we have so many needs and so many things that we want to fulfill But sex I think is pretty important for most people I've been a track to other people while in a relationship. Oh Well good for you, okay? I Feel like I've found people pretty Nothing to a point where I would even consider acting on it I don't think you can only be attracted to one person. I feel like that's really unrealistic I think it's crazy thing to deny that because I mean I think of every species existence as survival and procreation So it's a think that you can shut off that entire part of yourself not you just I think action is one thing because people Have successfully done that but in terms of feeling or seeing some one else as attractive. That's crazy. Well apparently there is one person that can say that in this conversation Well I'm sure he like took the question a different way I just I can't wrap my head I think it's totally possible like we can all be wired a little bit differently like we're all on a different point in the scale And I think our life experience also shapes us to a degree as to where on that scale we are Know it so I know I'm gonna sound crazy and I know it's like it's something that I always have disagreements with with my friends and I think it is a little bit of what you said you know being wired differently In the beginning when I first started dating my wife I was giddy giddy like in love that like there was just this giant bubble around a relationship But then as we as we matured in our relationship. We got married What what I felt uncomfortable with is looking at other women like it actually made me feel Uncomfortable so the same way that I trained myself to like if you want to call it suppress or whatever other other feelings and impulses I have I do the same here, so Whenever I see a girl like yeah I'm gonna walk down the street and I'll turn my head or whatever and there will be a girl wearing almost nothing or whatever my What I've like built-in is literally an instinct to just look away and not think any further What I think what's weird to me is like the conversations. I have with other people will they'll look at someone of the opposite sex find them attractive and keep going and like mentally they're having sex with like all these weird things and That's like, ""I'm really uncomfortable for me"" You're not saying like oh I was born only Thinking this one person is attractive ""right"" you're saying you trained yourself to be that way ""pretty much"" okay, that makes a lot more sense to me Would feel incomplete without my partner Honestly if I didn't never met my partner I wouldn't be the person I am today In the past year of dating my girlfriend I have become so different and I have learned so many things and they have started taking care of myself so much more than that was a year before I met her and I feel like that has so much to do with her, and how she helped me navigate this I had a really unsafe home life, and me and my husband got to know each other in the 6th grades We were 12 I moved out when I was 18 me and him like we had nothing We somehow made our way over to LA like. I honestly don't think I'd be here like if it wasn't for him oh Man I was married for some time so my whole journey the last two and a half years has been to feel complete by myself and There are times like I really do desire partnership. I do desire a primary partnership, but I really think it's so important to To be okay, just being as I am when the words Incomplete. I'm like no. I don't connect with that. I connect with I'd feel sad I'd feel hurt. I would feel Disadvantaged maybe even, but I'm still going to be me and I totally understand that we're coming from different places And how we developed our relationship my idea of a relationship is one plus one equals three One complete person plus one complete person equals a completely separate third I was gonna do this one, but a completely separate third relationship, and this would be incomplete ofcourse if we left But the ones would still stand still and be strong All right guys, thank you so much Hey guys my name is Dan, thank you so much for watching middle ground We love having these kinds of discussions And we love to have you guys Chime in on what you guys thought about this episode and what you would like us to do in future episodes So if you like us subscribe here and can watch more stuff here.

0,this is an investigation by the securities and exchange commission and the matter of fairness inc elizabeth holmes grilled by 12 lawyers investigated for massive fraud not how a young billionaire thought her empire would end please raise your right hand do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth i do it's certainly not where it began elizabeth holmes was born in 1984 at the dawn of tech nation just one month after the macintosh computer she was raised in washington d.c the parents from a young age thought of their daughter as a special person the mother worked for various members of congress the father worked for the state department mostly involved in human rights and she looked up to him as an idealist which is what she thought of herself as well she wrote a letter to her father when she was nine dear daddy what i want out of life is to discover something new something that mankind didn't know was possible i also want to study about man in his ways life is really interesting i love being with you it's my most favorite thing in the whole world love elizabeth i wanted to do something with my life that people thought was impossible before at a young age she was asked by relatives what do you want to do when you grow up and she answers immediately i want to be a billionaire and the relative says don't you want to be president and she says no the president will marry me because i'll have a billion dollars her family was no stranger to wealth elizabeth is the great great great granddaughter of charles fleischman and the massive fleischmann yeast fortune a 42-room mansion with 40 servants polo yachts safaris they helped found the new yorker magazine and bought coconut island off the coast of hawaii they entertained amelia earhart and shirley temple had a birthday party on their estate but the fortune was no more this magnificent family history that they had in terms of this extraordinary wealth had been dissipated by prior generations so this is a picture of the young elizabeth and her brother christian v joe fuse was the family's neighbor when elizabeth was a child this is my brother justin young elizabeth no evidence as yet of the black turtlenecks the past of the holmes family frequently came up and it's was not hard for me to imagine that the holmes family believed that elizabeth was restoring them to their rightful place the homes moved to houston where elizabeth excelled at a private school megan long went to st john's with her they both ran track and she says elizabeth was incredibly driven and never gave up typically when you run a race the thing that you're going to remember is the person who gets first place but elizabeth always finished her races last everyone would finish the race and then you hear the announcer say don't cross the track there's still a runner on the track that runner was elizabeth she was determined to do it a tutor came to the house for private lessons and elizabeth talked her way into college-level summer courses in chinese courses that weren't open to high schoolers and she convinced people that you know let her do it she really she talked mandarin on the phone to them and they were stunned and she got in her high school yearbook page says dream laugh reach for the stars in 20 years trying to save the world her song i'm in a hurry it all paid off when elizabeth went to california for college she picked stanford which was like the obvious choice if you were interested in becoming an entrepreneur and a successful one in the heart of silicon valley it's where many tech giants started varian hewlett-packard sun yahoo that's why it's called silicon valley and why it really generated that entrepreneurialism and of course that's probably why elizabeth came here in the first place yes i'm sure that's why she came here phyllis gardner is a professor of medicine here she first met elizabeth in 2002 this is wilberfield wilbur hall where most stanford freshmen start out elizabeth holmes first storm dorm room right well elizabeth was brought to me by a person who'd been the former president of panasonic saying to me that she was this brilliant girl and she had this wonderful business idea she came up with an idea for this blood testing device and the idea behind the blood testing device was that you would have a sticker on your arm and this would be constantly checking your blood levels and then if you needed to you'd be able to give yourself an injection of whatever medicine you needed the skin is a terrible barrier to go across and i kept saying to it it's not feasible and it just went to deaf ears how did she respond to the criticism just kind of blinked her eyes and nodded and left and then came back another time with the same sort of concept it was just a 19 year old talking who'd taken one course in microfluidics and she thought she was going to make something of it elizabeth didn't want to be told it was impossible because she loved the idea so she went to another professor he never allowed freshman in this advanced course and she persuaded him that she was capable of doing it and in fact she was elizabeth took chemical engineering classes as a freshman i was very intrigued by her vision channing robertson was the chair of the department i felt it would be a really interesting proposition and he thought hey you know what i see an opportunity here maybe maybe you can do this maybe you can't but let's give it a shot and he became a kind of a mentor to her and said to me maybe once a century you come across someone like beethoven she's a beethoven figure he said she's a genius she is this rare creature and he bet his career on it i think he was the first enabler he dragged her around campus introduced her to people and she was breaking down doors herself this used to be my advisor's office and i would sit here literally here in the hallway waiting for him to come back to his office to try to convince him to let me into his graduate research program in silicon valley one of the things that people brag about is that they drop out of college i was at a point where another few classes in chemical engineering was not necessary for what i wanted to do steve jobs dropped out of college mark zuckerberg dropped out of college bill gates dropped out of college gates jobs homes you just have this sense that there are certain people who cannot be held back elizabeth dropped out too she decided she was going to actually try to build it i think it's fair to say that sure it's a great idea but it's actually scientifically impossible but that didn't stop her from filing her first patent the first of many she had all the ideas but she didn't have the cash she didn't actually want to go to some of the traditional investors because she would have to prove that this was something that was even on a remotely far-off distant world um something that you could do so one person she went to was this guy tim draper who was a family friend he has made billions of dollars from his investments and he agreed to give her some money to get started i ended up giving her her first million dollar check everything seemed possible in 2004 but her next idea was much bigger something that would use just a drop or two of blood and draw more than a billion dollars in investments elizabeth holmes third revolution wow and her company began and so did the questions how quickly is it before you start to notice problems hi everyone george stephanopoulos here thanks for checking

0,"My name is Luca Faccio.  I am a photographer and live in Vienna.  I was able to visit North Korea 7 times since 2005.  Take pictures of the people there and their views.  During those trips of mine,  I saw more than was allowed.  Journalists visiting this country  accompanied by supervisors around the clock.  I have known my supervisor for several years.  Here I took photos with them.  They check what was filmed,  to whom you talk and about what.  I saw familiar pictures.  But from time to time I also see new things.  I saw some new ideas emerge in the middle  society caught up in this collective thinking.  A paranoid system,  to which I also have to give up.  It is mandatory for every start  visit in front of the statues of the two great leaders.  I am familiar with this.  The two statues are part of the large Mansudae Monument,  which commemorates North Korean resistance  against the Japanese occupation.  Its capital, Pyongyang, is populated  more than 3 million people  and also home to the middle class  the more it is becoming economically free from the state.  A middle class which is for the long term  could be a problem for the regime.  About 2 million cell phones have been licensed since 2008.  I was being watched on a cell phone.  It is also used for calling,  but only for domestic calls and those who are selected.  For example my supervisor.  This is the first time I've been allowed to  traveling by taxi.  But of course together with my supervisor.  We visited a supermarket where  I found typical Western products.  In my opinion,  the people were very well dressed.  There are casinos and mine even  discover Viennese coffee culture.  However, I was the only guest.  What surprised me was state television  featured Western propaganda figures.  During my visit, the controversial Slovenian rock band,  Laibach, was the first Western band to be allowed to perform.  The dream of reunification between North and South is still here.  However, the dream sank slowly as a result of a new provocation  and aggressive military tactics that are often used,  on the border which is referred to as  the most dangerous border in the world.  I try to find the condition of society  The real North Korea.  Because for me they are normal people  behind the system.  Appearance is deceptive.  I'm not in an ordinary gift shop.  I am in Panmunjong in the demilitarized zone.  There is no shortage of coffee, smiles and cartridges.  This is a toll road from Pyongyang to Seoul.  This is the railroad  disturbed for more than 50 years.  Here we have a manuscript by Kim Il-Sung.  Great leader Kim Jong-Il  visited this place four times.  I walked through the demilitarized zone  along with my supervisors.  Three people in total.  The atmosphere is unpleasant,  full of tension and dreamlike.  The day before I arrived, there was a shootout.  Today military exercises are underway.  It smells like ammunition and war.  My supervisor said his troops would protect me.  Not at all calming.  This zone extends along the peninsula  Parallel 38 (boundary line between North Korea and South Korea).  This is a place where allies are arbitrary  dividing the country after WWII.  The border zone is 248 km long by 4 km wide.  This region is considered the most dangerous border in the entire world.  I met a colonel here,  I have known him for 10 years.  It was close enough that we drank a lot  liquor after the meeting.  It was clear to me that there were people in uniform  and the person behind it.  This is where the truce and the end of the war are negotiated.  For you to take pictures is the most important.  You don't have to explain.  The Colonel took me from one barracks to another.  It is very important to mention how often and  any great leader who came to this place.  He has to tell me that.  But he was clearly interested in other things.  How does Austria report current conditions on the Korean Peninsula?  This is the most important location in August  related to the truce.  Two days after this building was completed, on July 27, 1953,  a ceasefire agreed and signed here.  On the day the agreement was signed, the Americans  want to move the building further North.  They didn't succeed because of the reporters  see it and prevent it.  On March 3, 2012,  Great Leader, Kim Jong-un said during a visit:  If there is another war with America,  we will not sign a truce.  We will destroy America until they surrender.  Evil America that moves buildings,  like a dream to me.  After the war we signed a truce.  But in the future war will not  there is another truce - Kim Jong-Un.  The casual way of talking about war here,  sounds like  the Italians talk about football.  My journey continues.  We head to the famous Blue Building  where is the meeting between the delegates  South and North Korea take place.  It is the border between the two countries,  made by the Allies who won in WWII.  I marvel at your persistence in drawing continually.  We arrived.  Blue lodges.  The beginning of drama for the Korean people.  The center line of the impenetrable border.  When compared to the Berlin Wall it is only like a garden barrier,  according to some.  A few meters from here is South Korea.  Anyone who tries to cross will be shot.  I heard there are some foreigners  that goes well with us here.  But benefit from us when they get home.  Later I learned that a translator  provide a different translation.  Maybe to save face  or on purpose, I don't know.  Critical questions are dangerous here.  There are 13 newspapers in North Korea,  but there is only one opinion.  Back in Pyongyang, I want to find out  what the public thinks about the reunification of the two Koreas.  I am allowed to talk  this with young students.  I want to say that I will not tell them  about our reunification.  All Pyongyang people should try  support the reunification of our country.  Another place that must be visited in  agenda is the birthplace of Kim Il-Sung.  He is the founder of the country.  And the house where he was born was a place of pilgrimage  which everyone must visit.  Father, mother and all members  his family fought against the Japanese.  So this is where President Kim Il-Sung was born.  Since childhood he received education  patriotic and revolutionary  from his parents.  So our communications expert Kim Jong-Un,  not only loved by young women,  but also by all Korean people.  Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il were both deeply loved.  Everyone loves the great leader.  But is it true?  It is very difficult to determine what is genuine  and what the faked here.  The same flowers here, sold several times a day.  They are placed once then collected  by a supervisor standing behind,  and then the flowers are 'recycled'.  Eternal tribute to the eternal president.  My next stop is a  monument to the founding of the North Korean Workers' Party.  It is 50 m high and is made of granite,  the monument depicts the communist symbol, hammer and sickle.  Coupled with the intended brush  on behalf of intellectuals.  The reliefs depict the battle between  the workers against the imperialist threat.  Here at the Trinity-Giving Life Church,  I got a surprise.  I'm documenting an art event  in the Russian orthodox church in Vienna.  As a result I was interrogated by counterintelligence.  In this Russian orthodox church in North Korea,  i use the same topic for  discuss human rights indirectly.  According to the Christian NGO Open Doors,  North Korea is in the bottom position in the ranking  global in terms of punishing Christians.  at Christ The Savior Cathedral in Moscow  to demonstrate against Putin's regime  during the general election campaign.  I believe the musicians insulted Our Lady.  I don't want to imagine what it will be  happens here if Holy Kim is insulted.  According to the pastor,  someone who has sufficient knowledge,  information from the outside world must come from a source.  If I ask directly about human rights,  it will be seen as a provocation.  And it can make my journey even more difficult.  In many ways, the people were silent  about things they don't want to talk about.  Concentration camps, cleaning, shooting,  those things are not here.  Officially, this place is heaven on earth.  North Korean people are taught from childhood  to accept all state ideologies.  To sacrifice their individual existence to the group.  Even a very young child  trained to fight adults  which indicates dissatisfaction  against the leader and the party.  I want to know when and how this brainwashing started.  I'm trying to find an answer from  this question at a school.  A school with more than 1,000 students.  However, when I visited, the hallways were quiet.  The principal led me to see the classrooms.  Everything looks so new and neat.  The schools I know are not like this.  This is our cloning lab.  This is a microscope.  And on the screen you can see  a cell is magnified 1,500 times.  It's a technical process for cloning animals.  He told me that Kim Jong-Il had made the announcement  that nano and biotechnology  is at the heart of North Korean science.  It seems so.  So that I don't just see empty classes,  The principal took me to a class  who is studying mathematics.  Everything seemed artificial to me.  I don't know what the truth is  taught to students here.  When I started recording, the students  unnaturally using the calculator.  But their calculations are absurd.  I think these students are just pretending.  Photos of great leaders are everywhere.  Hanging in each room.  When I asked a student what  he knows about Columbus who discovered America,  at first he was silent.  Then the principal asked me to leave  room because I disturbed the course of the class.  But there is another surprise for me in this visit.  I was invited to play soccer with 30 teenagers.  I've never experienced anything like this in North Korea.  A great moment for me wearing the Genoa shirt.  For them it's not about winning.  I think the students are playing bad on purpose  to make me look better.  In some game time,  there are about 200-300 students  sitting in the audience bench,  so it feels like in a stadium.  As a result of the latest UN sanctions, North Korea has had to stand alone.  No raw materials or products are allowed to be exported.  Looking at the current economic conditions,  I hope it's just a matter of time  before North Korea changes its tough nuclear policy.  I was allowed to visit a textile factory.  I've been here four times.  But the manager is new.  Please come in and have a look.  They showed a model of a weaving machine.  The workers who are mostly women,  is the pride of the country.  Officially these workers earn a salary of 5 Euros a month.  Very possibly their real salary  even lower.  The people here survive on food stamps,  which is shared by the government.  Malnutrition is common in North Korea  so that people become smaller.  I must say that this factory is very clean.  The workers laugh and joke.  It is clear that this country needs economic reform.  Exports to China decreased by half.  Plus, this country lost half  from his farm every year  as a result of natural disasters such as drought and floods.  Making the country helpless against climate change.  Like many other poor countries.  And because of the new sanctions,  North Korea has become more isolated than ever.  I'm glad I was allowed to take photos of some of the workers.  This is not an easy thing to do here.  My supervisors are responsible for my actions.  If I don't follow the rules,  the situation could also be troublesome for them.  Over the years,  the increase in the number of private vehicles shapes the face of the city.  This shows that something is happening in the capital.  Also at least in the private economy.  New buildings are being built  and the financial district reminds me  on the face of other famous cities in Asia.  But in reality, buildings  it is the home of the party's top brass.  I was fortunate to be allowed to visit  this kind of flat after a few years.  In the elevator, another surveillance can be seen.  There are people who document  where and when did the residents go.  It's hard to imagine this kind of system.  The flat shown to me is no ordinary flat.  It is a place of pilgrimage  forced by foreign journalists.  It was stressed that Kim Jong-un had  visit this place directly,  But does anyone live here?  There isn't any smell.  Everything is neatly arranged.  Like in a catalog.  I can't believe it.  I feel like I am in a film where  Kim Jong-un is the director in power.  On September 4th we went to work.  Suddenly someone came in a car.  They are looking for me.  They told me a great leader was coming.  I never expected that.  Of course I am happy.  It seems to me that Kim Jong-un doesn't just execute people  but also breaking entry.  It is not clear to me what was done  a dictator in someone's flat,  But things are different here.  Even though most North Koreans are penniless  to buy anything to increase their food rations,  there are still supermarkets with Western products.  The supermarkets are not always open  and many shelves are often empty  but this is a sign that class  medium is growing in Pyongyang.  And that they ask for openness or  at least certain luxury items.  As I mentioned before,  workers officially earn 5 euros a month.  You can't buy a lot of things with that money.  Those who shop here are from the upper middle class.  The longer I am here,  the more I believe it is the women who are  impose cultural changes on their country.  Their clothes were clearly no longer following the rules of propaganda.  They dress like Westerners.  The desire for luxury has reached Pyongyang.  Or at least in the upper class.  The women who were lining up in front of me shouted:  Long live the glory of Songun!  Songun means 'the primary military'.  And it is the name of the state ideology  put national defense in the foremost place,  so he can ward off threats  imperialism from the United States and Japan.  There is military service for men in North Korea.  The term is 10 years.  My beloved leader came here six times.  Dear General, came here four times.  The current leader has already come twice.  Who comes where and how often.  You are constantly being told this in North Korea.  I visited a state-owned vegetable plantation.  423 families live here.  New houses were built to expand agricultural cooperatives.  I wish I was allowed to talk to the people here.  I was promised that I would be taken to an operation site,  However I only saw a few people on the spot  which should be the home of 423 families.  In a tall building that looked like a watchdog,  I was allowed to film the workers.  From a safe distance.  It's not what I imagined.  Again this is typical of North Korea.  Giving up is not in my nature.  So I insisted on being able to meet the workers.  I don't want to just see what's allowed.  I'm here to get to know  Korean people better.  To achieve that I have to meet them.  I managed to convince my supervisors.  And after they called several times,  a group was gathered.  I was taken to the greenhouse.  As a side note, nothing  in untidy North Korea.  I don't think the word 'improvisation' exists in North Korea.  By the way  the red panel on the wall of the building reads:  vegetables for the people of the capital.  Beyond all the propaganda,  and what I call brainwashing,  Korean people often surprise me in a positive light.  It is very important to pay attention to details  in meeting with them.  Although they are always organized and organized.  Such gatherings had an impact on the people here.  I think that's the only way to  separating people with propaganda.  Pyongyang, a capital city with a population of more than 3 million people,  is experiencing a construction boom.  Skyscrapers were popping up everywhere  fill the city sky.  If you take a closer look,  South Korean names are covered in North Korean banners.  Like I said, you just have to pay attention to details.  I wonder where North Korea got it  money for this kind of construction project.  Nearly 80 percent of Pyongyang was destroyed in the Korean War.  Within three years  America dropped about 30 tons of bombs  napalm in different regions and cities.  But economically North Korea  stronger than South Korea,  until the 70s.  Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union.  After that North Korea fell  deeper into isolation.  Record a concert for the workers at  Pyongyang cannot be done every day.  I've been trying this for a few years,  but to no avail.  This recording was taken in 2013  When I was allowed to film  everyday conditions in North Korea,  while taking a walk.  Victory for me.  I can take a taxi for the first time.  To make this happen my supervisor must  call the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Of course I am not alone.  There are supervisors on my left and right.  As a tourist of course me  pay triple,  but it also happened in Rome and New York.  I discovered something new.  It may seem insignificant,  however the plane image belongs to a North Korean airline,  is advertising.  A surprise in a country  where public publications only show  the god-like leader.  This is new and maybe an experiment for  opening the country to a globalizing world.  Taxi driver with no thumb left  took me to a place you might not expect.  A most famous entertainment venue in Pyongyang.  Rink.  Often called the People's Ice Arena.  In 2007, this was one of the venues for the event  Ice Hockey World Championship for Women.  The Austrian team competes here in Pyongyang.  According to information, matches in North Korea  visited by the most people  and certainly not because there are so many fans here.  Pyongyang's middle classes meet to ice skate,  ice cream and beer on Sunday afternoons.  Unfortunately I didn't get a martini  however there is table tennis.  And the enemy, who is none other than me,  allowed to play and win on this occasion.  The face of the city of Pyongyang has not only changed architecturally.  Young people know rollerblading.  And often seen in gardens  where tanks usually patrol.  Or at least first.  Arrivederci!  I'm not sure Italian is being taught here  but it is a start.  Talk about 'arrivederci',  The Arirang Festival always catches my eye.  As for anyone who has seen it.  Named after an old Korean folk song,  and trying to heroically portray North Korean history.  Using mass dance and gymnastic movements.  More than a thousand people participated.  Making it the biggest dance festival of this kind.  If I look beyond the propaganda madness,  The chorus is always very impressive.  The Arirang Festival is not held regularly.  Usually held in spring and fall,  but sometimes the festival is not held.  Those who participated, I was told,  get a television or refrigerator as a gift.  This grand event is intended to bind the community to  the political goals of the regime through extraordinary images.  I have attended the Arirang festival 4 times.  But this time I saw something strange.  People try to leave the stadium, temporarily  the supervisors tried to stop them.  The military was present in large numbers around the stage.  That's why I couldn't record for a long time.  The supervisors wanted me to focus on the show.  Is that a form of resistance?  There may be people in North Korea  who didn't want to accept a third member  from the Kim family as their leader.  Another historical incident occurred  in my last visit.  The controversial rock band Laibach  allowed to hold concerts in Pyongyang.  But what our concert in Pyongyang shows is  that both parties are willing to cooperate with the other.  Which was very hard for both parties to do.  The two of them had to stretch their outer boundaries  to make this project successful. And this is what I call  as a real and real cultural exchange.  When both parties work together,  and sacrifice something.  to achieve a common result.  So after Mickey Mouse, Western music  also arrived in North Korea.  The lyrics are translated into Korean  as can be seen at the top of the screen.  I think the Laibach concert you watched,  wouldn't be possible without three or  four major cultural collaborations,  that has been done before.  Music is a language without words.  Which may be understood in many different ways.  And this is a musical miracle.  You can't have a specific recipe  for music.  I feel for the first time that I finally understand these lyrics.  When Mina, vocalist, sings  Nothing's Going to Change My World,  in front of a Pyongyang audience of 1,500,  It was a magical moment for us.  Nothing will change my world  is the right sentence for that state  prohibits all kinds of Western music for its people.  Not infrequently they are found to have a CD or  a film from South Korea ends in a concentration camp.  Until recently, Western music could only be heard  at some karaoke bars for foreigners.  Whether Laibach will go down in history as such  Bruce Springsteen in East Germany?  Let's wait.  To me the North Korean people are very cheerful and optimistic.  At least that's what the people I've met have shown.  I think North Korean people  understand that nothing is eternal.  There are people who want to live in peace,  but as a result of mistakes made in the Cold War,  they are forced to live in continuous war.  I can't repeat how often  happy I am among the North Korean people.  I have a lot of friends.  My journey the last few years has taught me  that veiled criticism and generalizations are pointless.  Whether in Europe or in North Korea,  a country that I still don't know."

0,"think about everything you touch in a day now think about how much of it is plastic plastics are amazing materials they're lightweight but strong flexible but impermeable they're in our cars planes hospitals weapons and electronics plastic is everywhere but of course that's the problem plastic is everywhere more importantly plastics don't biodegrade that water bottle you use for ten minutes it could take 500 years or more to fully decomposed most plastics that we use are single-use short time use packaging and then they're discarded that mismatch between plastics short use and long life results in an overflow of plastic waste think about how crazy this is to get the raw materials for plastics we spend billions pulling fossil fuels out of the earth then we pollute the earth to make plastics and then we toss those plastics right back into the ground where they came from I think 50 years from now what will happen is people will be digging out land fields and taking out product to recycle and they will think we were crazy people of dumping things in landfills so we should just get rid of plastic small problem there is nothing better at doing what plastic does than plastic when it comes to its low cost versatility and durability the plastic we use today is unbeatable we're not going to get rid of plastics anytime soon so we better deal with them in a more intelligent way from where they come from and also where they go after we're done using them that means two things we have to develop new environmentally friendly materials that can replace petroleum-based plastics and we have to find a way to clean up the plastics we've already discarded one of the team's that's developing a sustainable replacement for plastic is here in this lab at the Center for sustainable polymers at the University of Minnesota the majority of plastics that we use now are from petroleum and by majority I mean more than 90 percent maybe more than 95 but the team at this lab is trying to change that they are trying to totally rethink where a plastic can come from could you make a plastic of living materials like plants or bacteria one of the common misconceptions in the world of plastic is that there's plastic well actually there's several different varieties of plastic you familiar with recycling symbols there's seven of those so there's no one plastic that will replace all plastics at the lab researchers are working on several types of bio plastics that's plastic made out of renewable resources that could be used for everything from the soles of shoes to housing insulation the latest breakthrough is a new type of foam that could replace petroleum-based cushioning like what's in car seats and bedding and it all starts with bacteria it's eco life its STD check life so that's the strain that we use for our experiments the e.coli is genetically modified meaning it's given a new set of instructions in this case to synthesize molecules that can be polymerized to create new materials then they're fed sugar shaken and fermented the byproduct of this process is a molecule that's a precursor to plastic when mixed with a catalyst in the lab the chemical reaction produces this bubbling gel-like substance when it hardens you've got foam so it's still pretty sticky but this can then be cut and thrown into pillows the main reason that I think this is important is because the feedstock is renewable there's an endless supply of bacteria and sugar a far cry from petroleum which is limited in supply and expensive to find so that's where the foam comes from but what happens when it's time to throw it away when you're ready to get rid of that car seat or pillow most phones aren't recycled and if they are they're chopped up and broken into a degraded material but if this foam is collected it can be chemically broken back down into the same precursor they started with which can then be used to create new foams over and over again the lab is also working on a replacement for rubber in things like shoes tires sporting equipment or household items so we want to look for rubbery materials things that are stretchy that are elastic that can be extended and they snap right back this process starts with starch from corn chemists can synthesize the polymer in the lab dry it and then mold it once we form some of the rubbers that we use today we can't reprocess them they can just be ground up and make the playground rubber material but this you can melt and reprocess and reuse it and it's compostable that's what we strive for right because we don't want to have our ocean filled with process so why aren't materials like this in all of our couches and shoes already so I oftentimes joke that my lab has produced a lot of materials that have interesting and exciting properties but nobody really cares about him that's because the bio plastics in this lab are still relatively expensive to produce especially now with oil prices so low the unfortunate reality is that consumers like you will not pay a premium for bio renewability or degradability they're not much of a premium an ideal bioplastic would not only look and perform as well as petroleum-based plastics it would be just as cheap and easy to produce it probably won't look any different I'll still grab the bag to put my fruit at the grocery store except it'll be from bio-based feedstocks and except when I throw it away it'll have a facile route to decomposition to give environmentally innocuous byproducts if this lab succeeds a better world might look a lot like the one we already live in bio plastics may be a few years out but there are steps we can take today to help clean up the plastic we've already used we're at carbon light industries in Riverside California it's a plastics recycling plant one that specializes in recycling a type of plastic called PE tea that you find in most soda and water bottles every day 300,000 pounds of plastic bottles arrive in bales that's 3 billion bottles a year they're sent through a maze of high-tech machines that sort clean melt and sanitize them it's what you think of when you think of a recycling plant except carbon light does something few recyclers are actually able to do turn plastic bottles back into material for new plastic bottles this is Leon Ferran ik founder and CEO of carbon light by the way Leon's been in plastics for a long time he ran one of the first companies that introduced plastic bags to grocery stores in the 80s I feel that ok I brought grocery sacks and all that now I'm what do you call it redeeming myself and I'm doing recycling until recently most plastic bottles collected for recycling in the US were sent overseas a lot of the bottles that was collected in California for example or other places were being shipped to China so what the Chinese would do take the bottles transform it into a lesser material like a carpet like fabric and then ship it back to us bottle to bottle like what we do that we call it cradle to cradle that that happens a lot less what most people don't realize is when they throw a plastic water bottle into a blue or green recycling bin that bottles less likely to become another bottle than it is to become something else like carpet or teddy bear stuffing and if it winds up living a second life as carpeting or teddy bear stuffing then it more than likely ends it's recyclable life there that's because those materials are harder to collect and recycle why not just turn old plastic bottles into new ones well it's expensive and you have to have a very sophisticated facility like this one to be able to make the necessary material for people to use it for their beverages Jeff Walsh vice president of operations took us around to show us the inner workings ok so this is where the process starts one of these bales weighs about 1300 pounds or so first bottles are broken out of bales trash and non PE tea materials are separated using optical sorters then a rinse cycle begins to remove labels and camps colored and clear materials are separated then they get crushed and hot washed finally the bottles are ground into what carbon light calls cornflake the last step is melting the flake and cutting it into beads Jose VA is the Quality Control Manager at the on-site lab we operate 24 hours a day seven days a week and our sole purpose is to test the lab tests the product to make sure it meets manufacturer's standards for safety and structural integrity with the most recent dip in oil prices Ferran ik says plastics derived from petroleum are currently cheaper than carbon lights recycled material even so customers like Nestle and Pepsi still buy carbon light's product to use in some of their bottles after all who doesn't like to see an

0,"So originally, I was gonna make a video talking about boy scouts, because I was a boyscout. But then as I was writing the script I thought about all the fun things I did as a cub scout. So here we are! Cub scouts is something you can do before you're old enough to be a boy scout. It's not required to do cub scouts to be a boy scout... it's just, if you're up to it, or your parents signed you up for it, you can do it. Now you're already pretty young when you can start doing boy scouts. Hence why it's called BOY scouts not...MAN scouts. You can start doing cub scouts when you're seven. At what point does it just become baby sitting in uniform? So all you people watching over the age of 7, let me tell you what you missed out on. Unlike boy scouts who wear our tan uniform, Cub scouts wear a dark blue uniform. Now there are four ranks to the cub scouts. Now there were some requirements you had to do to go up the ranks, but if you went to the meetings every week you'd be fine. You didn't have to do anything on your own time. And even if you did all the requirements for the rank, you still had to be in the rank for at least a year. So, basically, the ranks are based on your age. When you were seven years old and in first grade, you were a tiger scout. The second graders were the wolf scouts, the third graders were the bear scouts And the fourth graders, AKA the really cool ones because you're the oldest... ...Actually, before I tell you, just guess what the mascot for the fourth and final rank of cub scouts is. Just leave you're guesses in the comment box below! Just kidding, don't do that, I don't care. We have a tiger, a wolf and a bear (Hehehe! That rhymed.) What animal is cooler than all three of those? I'll tell you! Nothing. And that was the mascot. There was no mascot. Welcome to the real world, fourth graders! There's no such thing as cartoon anthropomorphic animals. *COUGHING* So, if you did guess anything in the comments...you were wrong. I told you not to guess. The fourth and final rank of cub scouts was called... Webalos! Weeb...A-lows. Very fitting name... It goes tiger, wolf bear, WEEBALOS?!? WHAT KINDA ANIMAL IS THAT? Apparently it's supposed to stand for ""We be loyal scouts."" Because...we talk like pirates. Don't worry, cub scouts, I'll make you a mascot for the...WEEBALOS. Here, it's a made-up animal for a made-up word, use it however you like. The wikipedia page also talks about a bobcat badge but...I don't remember doing that, so that's... whatever, it's not important. I can't even remember what we DID as cub scouts! We would just meet at some person's house, I think it was one of the kid's moms? And she would have some kind of activity for us to do and we would just...play. My mom told me that she was my scout leader for a year but I don't...remember that. I DO remember we talked about bike safety. And I remember I fell off my bike a lot. I still got the award though. Each rank had a handbook that said what activities you would do. And I looked on google to find pictures of the book, and I found gritty, serious, tough covers. And I was shocked, because the handbooks I grew up with... ...had the mascots on them! And liked it! The old books were CUTE and had PICTURES! You're not trying to get rid of the mascots, aaare you cub scouts? I think it's funny that each mascot gets progressively unhealthier. Which is why my weebalo mascot looks the way it does. And I think I might be suppressing this memory, but  every time we went up a rank, there would be an award ceremony thrown by the leaders. And I think we...metaphorically drank the...blood of the mascot? I mean it was really just fruit juice. But...*phone ringing* Uh, hey TJ. Do you remember cub scouts? Uhm... Did we, whenever we went up the ranks, did we... Did we metaphorically drink the blood of the mascot? Oh. We had weird leaders. Okay, bye TJ. *beep* So another thing we did as cub scouts was go to this thing called cub-scout day camp. I dunno if it was just an arizona thing, but I hated it. Cubscout day camp took camping and made it...unfun! And surprisingly, even as a seven and eight year old, I loved camping! ""Really James? Someone who sits infront of a computer all day drawing pokemon? You like toughing it out and sleeping in the woods?"" YES AUOUWH YES! If you've never been camping, GET ON THAT! I'm talking about real camping though, not this...DAY CAMP. Cub scout day camp was during the summer. An ARIZONA summer. And we would get up super early, like 8 o'clock, eat breakfast at home and then you and your whole troop carpooled for about two hours to camp. There were a bunch of other cub scout troops that met there to, it was a pretty big thing. You were supposed to pack your own lunch, and all the other boys had really cool lunches like Lunchables, and Gogurts, and ironically Sooubway. I was jealous of kids with Sooubway sandwiches. And all my mom packed me was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich...on wheat bread! So before the day even starts, I'm already in a bad mood. You start the day sitting in this this big auditorium, but it's outside. They told us all to drink lots of water, and they actually gave all the troops water balloons. And they wanted us to throw them at each other because that would keep us ᴍᴏɪsᴛ and not die of heatstroke. But waterballoons are stupid because ninety percent of the time they don't even break on impact! You're just beating some poor kid to death with a bag of water! Then you would split into your troop and there was a rotation of activities for you to do all day. We ate dinner, then we went back to the auditorium, and then some of the leaders put on a play. I mean, it was a pretty dumb play, but I was invested in the story! But then at 10PM...YOU WENT HOME! You didn't even get to sleep in a tent! Sleeping in a tent is one of the most fun things about camping! And also the whole time, we didn't get a campfire, because it's dangerous to have fire around 7 to 10 year olds or something. But they did let us do archery. Cos' that's safe! And then the next day you went back and you did it all over again. And then you would do it for a third day too. Three days of this! Three days of people throwing water balloons at you, and you can't get them back because you have a weak throwing arm. And you're probably wondering James what's with all the complaining? This sounds like fun! I mean sure, other kids probably had fun. I might have been a little dramatic as an 8 year old. One time on the second day of camping, I was clumsy and I kept falling off the rocks I was climbing on. And I kept getting all these scrapes and bruises and they really hurt! And then we went swimming, that was one of the activities, there was a swimming pool. But just being the little punk kid that I was, I was like... ""NO! I DON'T WANNA GO SWIMMING!"" So they made me sit off to the side and they said I couldn't swim. But later I was like...""I wanna go swimming now."" After you swam, the leaders told you to check your shoes for scorpions. And I remember I didn't check, because I hated everyone. And you know the play that the leaders put on at the end of the day? It was split up into three parts. One part for each day. So I was left on a cliffhanger. I wanted to go see it, but everyone else in the troop wanted to play with water balloons. And I never found out how the play ended! And then on the next morning when I was supposed to leave for the third day, I told my mom I didn't want to go. And she had to tell the carpool that her son didn't want to go because he's a huge pus- And then afterwards when they were handing out the awards, I didn't get a single award. Because I didn't go the third day. So I didn't finish any of the activities. And then I never went back to cub-scout day camp since. And that's why I hated it. Woah, I didn't even mention the pinewood derby... I DIIDN'T EVEN MENTION THE PINEWOOD DERBY! So, I liked cubscouts,  I think it's good because it makes you go outside and supposedly it teaches you important safety things, or something. I mean look how I turned out. Also, incase you missed it I got a store now, I got a whole bunch of stuff for you. One of the products that I'm excited about is the plushies. Also everything in the store is on sale, but only until october 14th. So you have a couple of days left to do your shopping, I guess. And if you buy your plush by October 21st, it will come with a signed card... ...by me, obviously, who else would sign it, so I think that should wrap up the video, right after you wear your seat belt. 👌︎🕆︎✡︎ 💣︎☜︎☼︎👍︎☟︎☜︎☠︎👎︎✋︎👍︎☜︎ ☞︎☼︎⚐︎💣︎ ❄︎☟︎☜︎ ⚐︎👎︎👎︎📂︎💧︎⚐︎🕆︎❄︎ 💧︎❄︎⚐︎☼︎☜︎ ☠︎⚐︎🕈︎"
0,good morning John VidCon is next week so I'm super stressed out and not really able to concentrate on anything in particular nice thing though is that now I'm old and so I understand that this is happening and I know the solution very weird animals luckily the Internet is almost as good at sharing weird animals as it is at sharing celebrity drama and reality destroying rage lies I realize this recently while on Twitter and seeing this very good water anole it looks silvery because it has a thin bubble that clings to its super hydrophobic skin that bubble has oxygen diffusing into it and then it exhales into the bubble and inhales newly oxygenated air thus allowing it to stay underwater for more than 15 minutes so John I'm gonna start every once in a while sharing with you a bizarre beast of some sort to ease my own mind and maybe make us all feel better about our lives on this beautiful danger ball so let's start out with what about faves the mola mola or the ocean sunfish I love this fish so much you may recognize them from this video that thing is big J what is that thing it looks right for this video game or from a viral tumblr rant that I read from some philistine claiming this thing is so worthless it doesn't realize it shouldn't exist you that's not how this work the various species of sunfish are successful and you know how I know that because they were doing just fine before we started accidentally ripping them out of the ocean with the rest of our fish cat and throwing a bunch of indigestible trash that looks exactly like their favorite food into the ocean they eat jellyfish which is also the favorite food of a lot of sea turtles which made me think if there's some convergent evolution going on here because when you turn them all them all on its side it kind of has a very similar swimming style to a sea turtle almost as if there's a good reason for this ridiculous shape and yes I recognize that they look dumb in Taiwan they called them the fish that looks like a toppled car and the Polish name for them is basically just a head which I yeah I see it but just because it looks funny doesn't mean it's not a good fish broth they are the biggest of the bony fishes and they get very very big up to about a thousand kilograms up until recently we actually assumed from their lack of swim bladders and they're very weird fins that they were themselves a kind of plankton that they would just go wherever the ocean currents would take except it turns out they can actually swim pretty fast in fact the only people who have ever been hurt by sunfish were hurt when sunfish jumped out of the water and into a boat but that's when they're relatively young when they're less young they are not very fat they're pretty slow but because they don't need to be fast because they're so big and they have fecundity proportionate to their size a female adult sunfish can lay up to 300 weight for it million eggs for clarity that is more than the entire world population of adult sunfish sunfish are called sunfish because they Sun themselves they lay flat on the water either to warm themselves up so that they can go back down deep and get cold again or because they want seagulls to come and peck worms off their side maybe both maybe neither but weirdly baby sunfish also kind of look like sons with you know like a super gross eyeball inside of them and they grow extremely fast the Monterey Bay Aquarium had a sunfish for 15 months that grew from 50 pounds to almost 900 pounds it was so big that couldn't fit it in the tank anymore so they had to airlift it by helicopter to freedom birth to adulthood mola mola increase in mass by more than 60 million times and John their skeletons look like very dangerous spaceships yeah I get it other animals are cute and fuzzy and they look like they're smiling at you and mullah bowl I have their big terrified eyes locked into a bumpy head and can't fully close their mouths and have huge amounts of parasites both in and around them but we have no idea what's going on in that big dopey head body and I just want all of the mola mola in the world to know I love you you're doing great keep being lumpy and magnificent John I'll see you on Tuesday

 Reviewer: Leonardo Silva I come from a large, wounded family. By the time I was 24, both of my parents
 and three of my brothers had died. And even though I still had two sisters,
 I felt abandoned and alone. I remember watching The Sound of Music
 with all those kids lined up in a row; it was like the family I never had. I couldn't wait to be a mother. Life would be perfect, or so I thought. I met Rob when I was 26,
 he wrote me a love song, and we were married three months later. (Laughter) It was a really good love song! (Laughter) A year after that, we had our first child and then, four more. When Chris was just two weeks old,
 we ventured out to the local market. An older woman there took one look at him, so tiny, bundled up
 in his bright blue baby blanket ... She said, ""God bless him,""
 and I burst into tears. One day, you're a regular,
 rational person; the next, you're a mom. You have this amazing responsibility to protect your children,
 to prepare them for the world. You love them more than anything, and all you want to do
 is dress them in matching colors. (Laughter) Here we are at a church camp
 near Colorado Springs. Our younger son
 may be wearing a girl's shirt. (Laughter) As a mother of five,
 you just do the best you can. (Laughter) We figured out pretty quickly that one thing you want
 when you're raising kids is community. For us, that was the church. We were at church a lot. We led Bible studies in small groups, Rob was a worship leader
 and I sang on the praise team. And we homeschooled all five kids
 who basically had the run of the place. Here's Annie, leading
 a Bible study for her dolls. (Laughter) Life was good! Our amazing children
 grew into amazing adults, and we had our trusted community. Then one day, the phone rang,
 and everything changed. It was Annie calling
 from college, she was 20. I was wiping down the white-tiled
 counter in my bathroom when Annie says,
 ""Mom, I got something to tell you. I'm attracted to girls.
 I think I'm bisexual. I prayed about it, mom,
 I've resisted it, but it won't go away."" Now, I know what you're thinking. You're hoping I whipped out
 a rainbow flag and said, ""Annie, that's totally fine,
 we accept you just the way you are."" But that's not quite what happened. See, I had nothing against
 LGBTQ people, really, but after 20 years
 in the Evangelical Church, I believed that being gay
 was somehow wrong. (Sigh) I love my daughter,
 and I thought I had to protect her. So I said, ""Annie, don't give in,
 we'll support you. How can I help?"" (Sigh) As I hung up the phone, my heart sank. I knew we'd never be
 the same in the church again. Later, at Bible study, I shared
 with some of my closest friends, hoping they'd give me some wisdom. Instead, they just went
 straight to the rules. They said, ""Being gay is a sin
 and you can't accept it."" Not accept my daughter? What does that even mean? I was devastated. I realized I was being asked to choose between the two
 most important parts of my life: my child and my church. I chose my child. (Applause) Thank you. What else was I going to do? I chose Annie. And we left the church,
 we lost our community. And eight years later, half of our family
 still doesn't speak to us. My faith was fraying at the edges. I needed to understand this. And what does the Bible
 even really say about it anyway? I needed to understand,
 and I began to read everything I could. I even went to a seminary. And I learned that most Christians
 do accept LGBTQ people. (Applause) Yeah. (Applause) And I also realized that I had become
 extremely judgemental. That was a really hard realization. But I began a deep process
 of deconstructing that judgement. Meanwhile, Annie called from New York. She said, ""Mom, I'm dating women now, and I am more at peace with God
 than I've ever been."" That was all I needed to know. (Applause) Rob and I came to complete
 peace about Annie. Three years passed, things were good,
 Annie came home for a visit. We were in the kitchen
 making salads for lunch, and she said, ""Mom, are you sure you won't change your mind
 and reject me, you and dad?"" I was like, ""Sweetie, I am sure
 we will not reject you. But why are you asking?"" Then she told me about her friend Alison. When Alison came out, her mother threw her down the stairs
 and threw dishes at her. That was a real wake-up call. It wasn't just about our little family,
 it was about countless other families. Around that same time, I went to a Christian women's gathering
 where the speaker was saying, ""You've got to do
 what God calls you to do, no matter how uncomfortable,
 no matter how unexpected. If God calls you, you've got to do it."" So I went to her at the break,
 and I said, ""As you were speaking, God was telling me
 to serve the gay community."" (Applause) It's not what she expected. (Laughter) She said, ""You mean
 to help them not be gay, right?"" (Laughter) So much for hearing
 God saying the unexpected. (Laughter) But I knew in her response
 that this is a huge problem. LGBTQ people are being bullied,
 beaten, shamed, abandoned, and rejected. And parents are being asked to choose between a demanding God
 and their own child. And none of this has anything to do
 with what we learn from Jesus about the power of love. (Applause) Research shows that 57 percent of transgender youth 
 without parental support attempt suicide. But with parental support,
 that number goes down to 4 percent. 57 percent to 4 percent -
 that's the power of a parents' love. I knew I had to do something,
 I had to reach the parents. So I started a blog. And the more I wrote, the more people
 came out of the woodwork ... They said things like, ""When my son came out,
 I wondered where we went wrong,"" ""My daughter is a lesbian, now I'm afraid 
 of what people will say about us."" One mom, Caren, was terrified
 that her son would go to hell and she would too for supporting him. Her pastor had told her that. I invited her to my home for the weekend, and I said, ""Caren,
 no one is going to hell here. Your job is to love your son, that's it."" (Applause) Her family was restored, and her son
 has blossomed into his true self: he's a fabulous dancer! It was so gratifying to help
 other Christian parents come to peace, reconcile their faith issues,
 and keep their families together. It became out full-time work. We made a lot of progress, and my little blog grew
 into an online support community with more than 3,000 moms and dads and more than 50 local regional groups
 where parents meet face to face. (Applause) But, for every parent we helped, we heard from just as many
 LGBTQ people in crisis. One young man came out to his parents, and they put all his belongings
 on the lawn and set them on fire. Another received a delivery
 of black roses from his family to say he was dead to them. And one young woman
 stepped out of her college library to find her parents on the corner waving Bibles and shouting,
 ""God hates fags!"" Can you imagine? And these parents think this is love,
 they call it tough love. They've been told
 that they're loving their children by shaming and shunning them,
 and seeking to make them straight. But I know what love feels like,
 and that is not love. Real love ... (Applause) Real love accepts people as they are,
 with room for who they may become. I also know what it's like to be the child
 who lost both her parents. Mom died when I was just nine,
 and dad when I was 23. And that loss shows up in big ways, like their absence at your graduation, or your wedding. And it shows up in small ways too, like when you just need
 some mothering or fathering, after a fight with a friend,
 or when your car makes a funny sound. (Laughter) Or when just want to go have coffee
 and talk about things. The hard truth is that some LGBTQ children
 will never get their parents back. What are they to do? These kids need parents. And that's why I do this work. I'm a mom and I love these kids, and I encourage other moms
 and dads to love them too. Parents in our FreedHearts community step in and support LGBTQ people
 whose families have abandoned them. Let me give you an example. Ken and Kathy were married 11 years
 when Ken relieved a deep secret. Ken knew that he had been born
 into the wrong body. His parents disowned him, but Kathy was supportive
 as Ken transitioned to Kendra. Later, they wanted to have
 a fairy-tale wedding as two brides, to renew their vows and celebrate
 this new chapter in their lives. Their parents didn't come. And that's where
 Linda and Janet stepped in. Linda and Janet are two moms
 in our FreedHearts community. They were there for them
 as if they were their own child. They sat on the front row
 and cheered them on. And after the wedding,
 the brides gave them each a bracelet that said, ""Thank you for being the mom
 you didn't have to be."" Rob and I have begun
 to officiate LGBTQ weddings too. Here's Stephany and Cindy. And Erica and Ryan. And we have other weddings
 on our calendar. For most of these people's lives,
 the message that they've received from those who represented
 the voice of God condemned relationships like theirs. As pastors, Rob and I
 represent the voice of God, and it's a voice of love. (Applause) We go to graduations,
 we talk on the phone, and we remind people
 of how wonderful they are. We go to pride events across the country, with our signs and buttons that say
 ""free mom hugs"" and ""free dad hugs."" LGBTQ people come up to us
 and melt into our arms. Many have not had
 parental encouragement in years. As moms and dads, we tell them,
 ""You're worthy, you matter, you belong."" That's the power of a parent's love. (Applause) It's human to be frightened
 by things we don't understand. It's not just religious fundamentalists who respond in ways
 that are damaging and hurtful. We can all behave badly when we are not listening
 to our better angels. How we treat people of color, refugees,
 people with disabilities, the elderly, people on the other side of the aisle,
 or people in our own family, anyone who is not how we think
 they should be, who's not like us. We try to make them like us. When that doesn't work, we reject them. Yet, every major religion
 has some version of the golden rule: to treat others the way
 you want to be treated. After my mother died, I remember
 sitting in the kitchen at the table. I had drawn the picture of a casket. My sister came through
 the kitchen with a friend, and I said, ""How do you spell 'deceased'?"" I really needed to talk
 to somebody about that. She spelled it, she shrugged
 her shoulders at her friend, and they went out the back door. And I looked at my picture, and even though I was only nine,
 I understood I would be alone in this. What a gift it would have been if somebody had seen my shuttered heart,
 my desperate need, and been there for me. But there was nobody. No child, no person
 should ever have to feel like that. (Applause) So here's my invitation to you. Look around for someone in your life
 who's not been treated well, who's been treated badly, and treat them the way
 you'd want to be treated. It could be your child, a family member,
 a friend, a neighbor, or a stranger, someone who could use some encouragement. You can choose to love them. ""There is no fear in love,
 but real love dispels fear."" And real love - real love -
 accepts people as they are with room for who they may become. Thank you. (Applause)"

disgusting the place looks inside I can't imagine the amount of bacteria hidden inside initially when I saw this review I was very worried that there was a problem in the kitchen I asked the head chef the line cooks the dishwasher and the servers if they knew what dish this was nobody could figure out what it was the owner also tried to reach out to you with no luck I looked at your previous yelps to get an idea of who I was dealing with and I saw a picture you posted of a burger with a one star review of the bar and grill in our town I did a reverse image search and it turns out that it's a stock photo available all over the web with a keyword search for rotten hamburger so immediately nothing you say has any bearing anymore you need to find a hobby maybe get a cat something to occupy your time other than writing false and inflammatory yelp reviews of various local businesses trying to make a living hello how are you doing good after seeing your pics lol I'm Linda piranha where are

 or just text “scishow” to 500 500. Protein has been an important component of human diets since forever, and so too has the consumption of meat. But nowadays, there are a number of religious, philosophical, health, and environmental concerns associated with the amount of meat people are eating. Like, I’ve talked over and over again about how our love of meat—my love of meat—is harming our planet. And meat consumption in places like the US has continued to rise over time even though we already eat way more meat than we need to nutritionally. So perhaps it is not surprising we’ve seen
 a number of companies lately trying to steer consumers away from their favorite meaty foods. I’m talking about things like Burger King’s Impossible Whopper, fishless sushi, or Quorn—which, despite the name, isn’t corn-based at all. All of these explicitly aim to get carnivores
 like me to come over to the veggie side. Now, people have pretty much always had non-meat options for protein, of course. Tofu has been popular for well over a thousand years, and it’s only one of the many options at the table alongside products like seitan or tempeh. And we even have newer tasty things like Morningstar Farm’s veggie corn dogs, which I’m a pretty big fan of. But simply having these vegetable proteins available hasn’t really reduced our overall consumption of meat because, well, people like me like meat. Studies have suggested that the best way to make meat substitutes attractive to non-vegetarian consumers isn’t to talk about abstract things like ethics, but instead, to actually get the stuff to look and act and taste like meat in a recipe. The thing is, mimicking meat is not as easy as, say, slathering something in barbeque sauce and sticking it on a bun. So today, we’re going to break down some of the challenges and the science behind making meaty fake meats. Let’s start things off with beef—
 and specifically ground beef. It’s one of the meats that protein producers would really like to be able to replicate because we love burgers. You’d think ground beef would be a fairly easy one, too, if you can nail down the taste part, because everything’s all ground up anyway. Still, you’ve got to give it the right look. You see, your first impression of a piece of food is often through your sense of sight, rather than your taste or smell, and studies suggest that this first impression can actually modify the flavor you perceive, a type of cognitive bias that scientists call a “halo effect”. So to really make a believable fake beef patty, you need something that bleeds like real red meat. Technically, “bleed” is not the right word for this, because the reddish juice that comes out of a steak or a cooking hamburger is not blood. It’s water mixed with broken down bits of the tissue itself, and the color actually comes from a molecule called myoglobin. Myoglobin is a protein in muscle cells that helps them carry and store oxygen. It’s similar to hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells. Both of these proteins get their oxygen carrying capacity and their red color from a molecule called heme. Now, heme is made up of a single iron atom surrounded by what’s known as a porphyrin group made of nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen. Each heme group can bind to a molecule of oxygen. When meat is cooked, the muscle fibers in it start to break down and release their myoglobin, which combines with moisture and other compounds being squeezed out by the cooking meat to form that fluid that gives the signature “bleeding” effect. And this isn’t just a visual thing. The heat breaks apart some of the myoglobin protein, too, releasing heme and some of the iron. That iron, now free, catalyzes chemical reactions that produce much of the aroma and flavor compounds which give cooked beef its smell and taste, as well as helping color the char on the meat. There are a couple ways you can approach recreating this effect, and different companies have different ways of making their fake beef more beefy looking. Beyond Meat uses plant colorings like beet
 juice to recreate beef’s color, for example. Impossible Foods, another meatless meat producer, has taken a different approach. They’re mimicking the myoglobin itself by adding a plant-based compound called leghemoglobin to the mix. Leghemoglobin is another protein that helps transport and bind oxygen— one that also uses a heme group, and even has a similar
 structure and the same, ancient evolutionary origin as myoglobin and hemoglobin— but it is not found in muscle cells. Instead, it was originally found in cells
 in the root nodules of legume plants like soy and beans. There, it helps get oxygen to the symbiotic bacteria that live inside the root nodules, which take nitrogen from the air and turn it into compounds the plant can use to grow. That’s the original source of leghemoglobin, anyway. But there isn’t really enough there to make
 extraction for this purpose practical. Digging up these plants and pulling the leghemoglobin out of their roots would simply take too much time and money. So Impossible Foods uses transgenic yeast instead. Thanks to genetic engineering, they were able to insert the gene responsible for creating leghemoglobin into yeast cells, which are relatively cheap and easy to grow. Then they extract the protein from these yeast. By adding these yeast-produced proteins to a mix of other protein material from plants, they can better simulate the look of actual red meat. >>Hank: Time for a taste test. >>Stefan: Yeah, we’re gonna test out—ah, we have three different kinds of food: fake meats versus real meats. >>Hank: Okay. It’s a double-blind, so nobody in the room knows the contents of this envelope, so not even our researchers are aware. >>Stefan: Yeah. We don’t know, we have different plates. 
 >>Hank: Sam will tell us if we get things right. >>Stefan: So the first thing we have are two
 burrito bowls, and they’re labeled A and B. >>Stefan: And, like, as we said, nobody knows which
 one of them is the impossible beef. 
 >>Hank: Okay. >>Stefan: And then one of them—
 >>Hank: Beef beef? 
 >>Stefan: —is just a regular beef beef burrito. >>Hank: You’re not a vegetarian, are you? 
 >>Stefan: No.
 >>Olivia: Oh, hell no. >>Hank: Oh, I see a little—I see some beef here. 
 >>Olivia: Alright, yeah. 
 >>Stefan: Let’s get some—yeah. >>Hank: That tastes like real meat to me. 
 >>Stefan: I made a good choice. >>Hank: But maybe it’s not. 
 >>Olivia: It’s a little too—mm hmm. 
 >>Hank: Now that it’s spent a little bit
 of time in my mouth. >>Olivia: It gets weird after a minute. 
 >>Stefan: Interesting. >>Hank: Yeah, that first bite was like, “That’s—” and I was like, “They put a lot of meat flavor in that meat.” >>Stefan: Well, let me—let me cross over, here. 
 >>Hank: Should I not have said anything? 
 So many arms. >>Olivia: Yeah. 
 >>Stefan: Just six. The normal amount. 
 >>Hank: Well, that tastes like fake meat to
 me now, too! >>Olivia: I still think that one’s real. >>Hank: You think that—? I think that one’s real! 
 >>Stefan: I think I’m just gonna get a little bit of the meat, just the meat. >>Hank: Yeah.
 >>Olivia: They’re both weird, so it’s hard to tell. >>Hank: Yeah. They’re very similar. 
 >>Stefan: Yeah. That’s incredible. >>Hank: I think A is fake. You think B is fake? 
 >>Stefan: I think B is fake. 
 >>Olivia: I do too—yeah, I still think B is fake. >>Stefan: What’s the answer, Sam? >>Sam: A is the real meat. 
 >>Hank: Ahhh! 
 >>Stefan: Yeah, okay. >>Sam: B is the imitation Impossible Burger. >>Hank: They—oh, god. 
 >>Stefan: It’s impossible beef. >>Stefan: I’m very familiar with ground beef. 
 >>Hank: Okay, yeah, I guess. 
 >>Stefan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. >>Stefan: This one has a little more moisture to it. 
 >>Olivia: This one’s spongy. 
 >>Stefan: Maybe people are after that. >>Stefan: It’s spongier! 
 >>Hank: Yeah. 
 >>Stefan: That’s a good way to describe it. >>Hank: Sorta bounces. 
 >>Stefan: But they’re very close! Like, I think I would only notice because I’m eating them back-to-back. >>Hank: Right. 
 >>Olivia: No, totally. 
 >>Stefan: Like, if I just ordered that?
 Like, I wouldn’t know the difference. >>Hank: It’s more seasoned, too, which I
 think maybe covers up some of the fake-iness. >>Stefan: Yeah. And it’s in a burrito bowl, which helps. 
 >>Hank: Yeah. Bye, everyone! Other faux meat producers are similarly invested in the visuals of their products. For example, a company called Sophie’s Kitchen uses turmeric to paint orange stripes onto shrimp substitutes. But no matter how good something looks, you also have to get the taste right, too. So all the different groups trying to make fake meats end up asking themselves the same question: what makes meat taste meaty? Heme is part of the answer for red meats, but seafoods are a whole other barrel of ... fish, obviously. Still, if you go to certain markets, you can get something that looks and tastes like fresh tuna. Except, it’s actually a Roma tomato that’s
 been peeled, de-seeded, and cooked sous-vide. And tuna’s not the only seafood that's being mimicked, either. Other producers are creating faux salmon,
 shrimp, calamari, scallops, and more. This’ll be great because I can’t eat scallops
 or I’ll die, so I can have a fake one! Capturing a fish or shellfish’s essential
 seafoodiness ultimately comes down to understanding the compounds most responsible for its smell and taste. But meats can contain thousands of different chemicals that contribute to that odor and flavor. And each different type of meat will have
 its own chemical fingerprint of sorts. In seafoods, sodium, potassium, chlorine, and phosphoric acid commonly contribute to that fresh-from-the-sea taste, for instance. But one thing all meats seem to share is a savory “umami” taste. According to some researchers, capturing that umami flavor is one of the biggest keys to a successful meat substitute—and one of its biggest challenges. Umami, or just “savoriness” is one of the five basic tastes, along with salty, sweet, bitter, and sour. Chemically, umami can come from a number of things, but most notably, it comes from compounds called glutamates. These are found in red meat because the amino acid form of glutamate, glutamic acid, makes up about a fifth of the amino acids found in animal proteins. Lots of different seafood is especially high
 in glutamic acid as well. But though these chemicals might be part of that signature meaty taste, they’re not exclusively found in meat. You can get glutamates from other sources. Seaweeds, soy sauce, mushrooms, and yeast extract can all add umami flavor. >>Hank: We walked into this room and Olivia said, “It smells like the inside of a chicken nugget in here."" >>Hank: It’s like—it’s like the smell of chicken nugget— >>Stefan: Oh, I’m loving it. 
 >>Hank: —has been distilled, and it’s like when they, like, make buttered popcorn jellybeans, but with chicken nuggets. Okay. >>Stefan: We’ve got some fish sticks. Ooooh. >>Olivia: Wow. 
 >>Hank: I mean, also both look fake. >>Olivia: Uh-huh. Well, yeah, it’s hard to tell when things are, like, this processed. 
 >>Stefan: Yeah. >>Hank: Okay. 
 >>Stefan: Oh, boy. >>Hank: I’m gonna start here with the less appetizing looking one. 
 >>Stefan: Yeah, let’s—okay, sure. >>Stefan: Yeah, these have a nicer golden color, I guess. I don’t know. >>Stefan: Mmm. The initial taste was better. >>Stefan: It’s okay. It does taste like a fish stick. >>Hank: It tastes like a fish stick that’s
 been microwaved, though. >>Hank: That seems real to me. >>Stefan: It felt real, yeah. 
 >>Olivia: Mm-hmm. It’s got some, like, color variation. 
 >>Hank: The coloration? Yeah. >>Stefan: Ooh, yeah. I bet they would do that on the fake fish, though. >>Hank: This looks like fake chicken nugget.
 It doesn’t flake like fish. >>Olivia: Yep. No, this is the fake one for sure. 
 >>Stefan: Mmm. Yeah. >>Hank: But I don’t dislike it. It’s funny because this one looks faker because it’s so bright yellow. >>Stefan: Uh-huh. 
 >>Olivia: This one tastes so much fishier. >>Stefan: I was gonna say this tastes more like ... 
 >>Olivia: Not in a good way. 
 >>Stefan: ...a bad chicken nugget. >>Hank: Right. We’re saying that B is real. 
 All of us agree. 
 >>Stefan: Mm-hmm. What’s the answer? >>Sam: A is imitation, and B is fish meat. >>Hank: B is fish meat. Yeah, that was pretty clear. 
 >>Olivia: Yeah, definitely. >>Hank: Still, I’d eat this all day. 
 >>Stefan: Oh. No, no, no. >>Hank: Maybe with some ketchup, though. >>Stefan: You want some ketchup? It turns out some edible plant parts, like
 tomatoes, are naturally high in glutamic acid— which is why, combined with their red color, they’re
 such a good choice for fake tuna. As for ending up feeling like tuna, well, two parts of the low, slow, and precise cooking from sous vide may be responsible for that. For one thing, the heat from cooking can make starches found in plant cells become gelatin-like while breaking down the cell walls. Secondly, sous vide items are typically vacuum sealed to increase heat transfer from the water to the food, but putting the fruit in a vacuum can make the tissue expand, and when the pressure is restored, the tissue collapses down, becoming denser and kind of meaty in texture. Of course, seafoods tend to be softer to begin with—not all faux meat textures are so easy to get right. If you’ve ever cut up a chicken breast, for example, you’ll notice that the meat has a kind of “grain” to it, like a piece of wood. That’s because muscles are made of long,
 narrow cells called muscle fibers. In skeletal muscles—the kind of muscle that animals use to move their bodies and which makes up a chicken breast or drumstick—the cells are arranged in long bundles surrounded by connective tissue. Most of the space in these long cells is filled with myofibrils: the cellular compartments that contain the stringy proteins which do the actual lengthening and shortening of the muscle tissue, and they are the main thing
 that gives meat its texture. And getting this texture right seems to be
 an important part of making faux meat attractive. For example, a study from 2013 exploring how much consumers liked meat substitutes found that people didn’t like textures that were too soft. They wanted something that was, like, chickeny. Replacing the protein content of chicken is straightforward since plants have plenty of proteins, but the plant proteins we use for faux meat don’t come in these long, aligned bundles. They’re more bunched up in what chemists would call a globular structure. The challenge is figuring out how to turn
 those bunched-up proteins into a fibrous, three-dimensional, meat-like shape. One method is to extrude them—a process which looks a lot like making pasta noodles or something. But the pressure and temperature are way higher, and the scale is way bigger. You start with plant protein. Legumes like peas, soy, or beans have a lot
 of protein, so they’re usually a good place to start. This protein is extracted— soy beans, for example, get a series of washes and soaks before being dried— and then put into a machine that looks kind of like a pasta press. There, it’s heated, which helps breaks the molecular bonds holding the globular proteins together—like disulfide bonds, which link sulfur molecules. Breaking these bonds causes the proteins to lose their shape and unravel, a process known as denaturing. Then, the pressure and flow in the extruder
 causes those now looser, stringier proteins to align more linearly. And as they reach the end of the extruder, they’re cooled, which allows the reforming of those chemical bonds to ensure they keep that fibrous texture. Once that’s done, they can be shaped into
 strips or crumbles, colored, and flavored further, and eventually shipped off to a store. So, that’s one way to do it. On the other hand, you could start with something
 that is more fibrous in the first place. Quorn is a meat substitute made from a filamentous fungus, and therefore it is what’s known as a “mycoprotein”. These meat substitutes are somewhat like muscles in that they’re made of a mash-up of cells arranged in very fine fibers, though these cells, called hyphae, are more branch-shaped. To make quorn, hyphae are mass-produced through fermentation—when harvested they apparently look kind of like bread dough. The “dough” can then be heated and centrifuged to recover the fibery proteins. These are then mixed with a binding agent and flavors, and extruded in a process similar to how the plant proteins were to make them even more meaty in texture. >>Stefan: And lastly, we've got some chicken. 
 >>Hank: Ooh! 
 >>Stefan: Ooh, woah! >>Olivia: Very strange. 
 >>Hank: Yeah! 
 >>Stefan: These are seasoned. >>Hank: Yeah, much more heavily seasoned. 
 >>Stefan: Which makes me think it’s fake. >>Hank: They gotta try harder on the fake stuff. >>Stefan: Why do we start with B? 
 >>Olivia: I don’t know. >>Stefan: Yeah, they are terrible. 
 >>Hank: But it definitely tastes like chicken. >>Stefan: It tastes like chicken. 
 >>Hank: It had the—the chicken taste. >>Stefan: Yeah, it does! 
 >>Hank: Like, very strongly, even. 
 >>Stefan: A little too chickeny. >>Hank: Like—yeah, like they concentrated
 it and poured it on them. 
 >>Stefan: Yeah! >>Stefan: You want some barbeque sauce? 
 >>Hank: Hell yeah! >>Hank: Hey! >>Stefan: Well, don’t cuddle it. Let’s get—
 >>Olivia: It’s beautiful. 
 >>Stefan: —let’s get some sauce on there! >>Olivia: Yeah, I think I have to try the other one before I can tell which one—what I think of this one. >>Hank: You’re not convinced? That that’s real? 
 >>Olivia: I’m not. >>Stefan: It’s good barbeque sauce. 
 >>Olivia: It doesn’t look like anything
 recognizable. >>Hank: Well, that’s how chicken nuggets work. 
 >>Olivia: I guess that’s true. >>Hank: Alright. Better looking but probably fake. >>Stefan: Oh, got a good crisp. 
 >>Hank: Now I’m not convinced! >>Hank: No, it’s fake. 
 >>Stefan: It’s fake. >>Olivia: I mean, even if it’s fake,
 the texture of this one is way more appealing. 
 >>Hank: Yeah, I agree. 
 >>Stefan: The tex—oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright. >>Hank: We think that A is imitation. 
 >>Sam: A is indeed imitation. 
 >>Hank: Oh, thank goodness. >>Stefan: Oh, yeah! 
 >>Hank: I like the fake one better, but yet
 I’m going back to the real one. Some are actually trying to take this idea of mycoprotein one step further by convincing fungi to grow in more muscle-like structures with the help of edible trellises— so you wouldn’t need the extrusion process at all. But, of course, there’s more to making a believable fake steak than getting a fungus to grow in a more steak-like way. After all, the texture of your meat isn’t
 just a matter of protein. Impossible Foods reportedly uses coconut oil
 in its burgers to mimic beef’s fat, for example. It turns out that meats are remarkably complicated mixtures, and getting things to look, taste, and feel the same is an equally complicated challenge. But, scientists are rising to meat it. Because we eat with our eyes first, researchers have found ways to make their fake meats look more convincing—like burgers that really do leech heme-juice. And by diving into the chemistry of how tastes work, flavor scientists have discovered how to use glutamates to bring meaty umaminess to plant-based foods. Some have even found ways to mimic the biological
 architecture of muscles to get the texture of meat mimics just right. There’s still a lot to figure out, though—after
 all, fake meats don’t always fool us. >>Olivia: I think that the beef was the most impressive. 
 >>Stefan: Yeah. 
 >>Hank: Yeah. >>Stefan: Definitely. There’s no reason to season a chicken nugget. And I’ve yet to see a believable meatless
 T-bone. But with so much being invested in mimicking meat, in the near future, people might actually be able to eat a more plant-filled diet without giving up the meaty foods that we love so much. And that would be great, because pretty much everyone who eats meat, myself included, should be eating less of it, or even none at all. I just really don’t want to give it up. Corn dogs!

0,"On a December afternoon in Chicago
 during the middle of World War II, scientists cracked open the nucleus
 at the center of the uranium atom and turned nuclear mass into energy
 over and over again. They did this by creating 
 for the first time a chain reaction inside a new
 engineering marvel: the nuclear reactor. Since then, the ability to mine great
 amounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to bill nuclear power as a plentiful utopian
 source of electricity. A modern nuclear reactor generates enough
 electricity from one kilogram of fuel to power an average American household
 for nearly 34 years. But rather than dominate the global
 electricity market, nuclear power has declined from
 an all-time high of 18% in 1996 to 11% today. And it's expected to drop further
 in the coming decades. What happened to the great promise
 of this technology? It turns out nuclear power 
 faces many hurdles, including high construction costs and public opposition. And behind these problems lie 
 a series of unique engineering challenges. Nuclear power relies on the fission
 of uranium nuclei and a controlled chain reaction that reproduces this splitting
 in many more nuclei. The atomic nucleus is densely packed
 with protons and neutrons bound by a powerful nuclear force. Most uranium atoms have a total
 of 238 protons and neutrons, but roughly one in every 140
 lacks three neutrons, and this lighter isotope is less
 tightly bound. Compared to its more abundant cousin, a strike by a neutron easily splits
 the U-235 nuclei into lighter, radioactive elements
 called fission products, in addition to two to three neutrons, gamma rays, and a few neutrinos. During fission, some nuclear mass
 transforms into energy. A fraction of the newfound energy
 powers the fast-moving neutrons, and if some of them strike uranium nuclei, fission results in a second 
 larger generation of neutrons. If this second generation of neutrons
 strike more uranium nuclei, more fission results in an even
 larger third generation, and so on. But inside a nuclear reactor, this spiraling chain reaction is tamed
 using control rods made of elements that capture excess 
 neutrons and keep their number in check. With a controlled chain reaction, a reactor draws power steadily
 and stably for years. The neutron-led chain reaction
 is a potent process driving nuclear power, but there's a catch that can result in unique demands 
 on the production of its fuel. It turns out, most of the neutrons emitted
 from fission have too much kinetic energy to be captured by uranium nuclei. The fission rate is too low
 and the chain reaction fizzles out. The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago
 used graphite as a moderator to scatter and slow down 
 neutrons just enough to increase their capture by uranium
 and raise the rate of fission. Modern reactors commonly use
 purified water as a moderator, but the scattered neutrons are still
 a little too fast. To compensate 
 and keep up the chain reaction, the concentration of U-235 is enriched to four to seven times 
 its natural abundance. Today, enrichment is often done by
 passing a gaseous uranium compound through centrifuges to separate lighter U-235 
 from heavier U-238. But the same process can be continued
 to highly enrich U-235 up to 130 times its natural abundance and create an explosive chain reaction
 in a bomb. Methods like centrifuge processing
 must be carefully regulated to limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel. Remember, only a fraction 
 of the released fission energy goes into speeding up neutrons. Most of the nuclear power goes into the
 kinetic energy of the fission products. Those are captured inside the reactor
 as heat by a coolant, usually purified water. This heat is eventually used to drive
 an electric turbine generator by steam just outside the reactor. Water flow is critical 
 not only to create electricity, but also to guard against the most dreaded
 type of reactor accident, the meltdown. If water flow stops because a pipe
 carrying it breaks, or the pumps that push it fail, the uranium heats up very quickly
 and melts. During a nuclear meltdown, radioactive vapors escape 
 into the reactor, and if the reactor fails to hold them, a steel and concrete containment building
 is the last line of defense. But if the radioactive gas pressure
 is too high, containment fails and the gasses
 escape into the air, spreading as far 
 and wide as the wind blows. The radioactive fission products
 in these vapors eventually decay into stable elements. While some decay in a few seconds, others take hundreds 
 of thousands of years. The greatest challenge 
 for a nuclear reactor is to safely contain these products and keep them from harming humans
 or the environment. Containment doesn't stop mattering
 once the fuel is used up. In fact, it becomes an even greater
 storage problem. Every one to two years, some spent fuel is removed from reactors and stored in pools of water 
 that cool the waste and block its radioactive emissions. The irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium
 that failed to fission, fission products, and plutonium, a radioactive material
 not found in nature. This mix must be isolated from
 the environment until it has all safely decayed. Many countries propose deep time storage
 in tunnels drilled far underground, but none have been built, and there's great uncertainty about
 their long-term security. How can a nation that has existed
 for only a few hundred years plan to guard plutonium
 through its radioactive half-life of 24,000 years? Today, many nuclear power plants
 sit on their waste, instead, storing them indefinitely on site. Apart from radioactivity, there's an
 even greater danger with spent fuel. Plutonium can sustain a chain reaction and can be mined from the waste
 to make bombs. Storing spent fuel is thus not only
 a safety risk for the environment, but also a security risk for nations. Who should be the watchmen to guard it? Visionary scientists from the early years
 of the nuclear age pioneered how to reliably tap 
 the tremendous amount of energy inside an atom - as an explosive bomb and as a controlled power source
 with incredible potential. But their successors have learned
 humbling insights about the technology's not-so-utopian
 industrial limits. Mining the subatomic realm makes for
 complex, expensive, and risky engineering."
0,"they're the most famous family in the world they're used to the very best of everything and that includes their food ask Graham newbould for six years he was a royal chef when you're cooking for the royal family things have to be done fairly simple but elegant lick things not too spicy things not too cold which could be harsh on the teeth portions not too big portions not too small they wouldn't like to be over face and they would like to think that food would have been wasted there's no room for error you can't really make mistakes that's where everything's so well practiced and rehearsed I did like things done a certain way whether it's right or whether it's wrong that's the way they like it and that's what you've got to do Windsor the Royals favorite place for entertaining this is the drinks reception before the Queen's Royal Jubilee Garter lunch on occasions like this the guests are often served a stalwart of royal cuisine the canopy kind of is are something that royal chefs know a great deal about there's one particular reception during the where a team of some 20 chefs have to produce 15,000 of these 15,000 canapes takes three days to make and they're all consumed within two hours nobody else in the land really has so many servants waiting on the table or such large dinners I mean for instance it's not uncommon for 140 people to sit down to dinner and some George's Hall at Windsor the footman actually walk along the table with a cloth dusters on their feet measuring out the distance between each place every knife and fork is placed in a specific manner and what is nice is even at the grandest occasion however busy she is the Queen may be 20 minutes for the first guests arrive she would go in and she will check that everything is just right it does look magnificent there must be a tremendous temptation for some people to remove a girl's booth when the guests sit down to eat it means things must be hotting up in the kitchen it takes an awful lot of planning time effort hardwork pep reactions disaster there before and all 20 chefs get involved it gets a little bit busy but not quite as hectic as what I restaurant kitchen would get it's all very well organized so on the day everything runs like clockwork in this particular main course is called duck bigger ad bigger ad means with orange and lemon sauce it's a particular favorite of the Queen and the royal family the Queen's wine collection is extensive and kept in perfect condition by the yeoman of the Royal wine cellar but among the vintage labels are a few surprises astonishingly one of her favorites is Mateus Rosie which a lot of people snare out as a nothing wine from Portugal it's a very good champagne it used to be vertically Coe Petrelli is a major feat in itself but now with all the economies it comes from Tesco's Buckingham Palace is known as BP to the staff to the royal family it's the head office and we're all royal catering is organized anything to do with food is taken care of by F branch from the odwin to the stars to the cooking of it and all the administration all belongs to to F branch a full state visit like this for the French president involves a banquet cooked by all 20 royal chefs 50 Butler's are on hand to attend the table the food is served on solid gold platters and eaten off the finest China a washing up is done very gingerly by hand but what happens when the Queen is home alone well when the Queen's on her own she would actually eat in her dining room on a card table possibly in front of the television and she'll serve herself from a sideboard and if she's not going out to lunch she does the same at lunchtime the role version of fish and chips which is called Haddix and Zuma King George the six used to send out for fish and chips and he and the Queen Mother and the Queen and Princess Margaret used to sit and eat fish and chips and listen to the radio those the smallest chips in the world oh uh and they thought that was an absolute gasps I mean that was wonderful sort of bohemian thing to do the portion size of the fish is really small and it's done in their breadcrumbs and we could have salt vinegar or tatis or something like that but Bearnaise sauce it's it's equally as nice it's made those egg yolks butter a vinegar and white wine reduction and some freshly chopped tarragon there you go fish and chips fit for a queen royal cooking and catering in the way they eat meals hasn't altered that much in the last hundred years I know it seems incredible but the way the royal family lived in Victorian times is not that different - no it wasn't just the senior Royals Graham had to cook for first of all need some cabbage next you need some freshly boiled lamb sliver finely chopped the final ingredient is some well cooked long grain rice this needs a really good stir and that's it it's ready to serve for half a century Her Majesty's yacht Britannia was the Royal Family's floating palace above decks the Queen played host to the most powerful people in the world the most important were invited for dinner served in the ships state dining room and in a style every bit as grand as at Windsor or Balmoral here I've got a few mementos of a trip I did with the Queen and the Duke to Australia on the royal yacht that's a picture on board ship with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and all the household staff I'm right in the middle the back in the shed every trip that you go on you're given a group photograph which is a souvenir for yourself to keep when you go on the royal yacht here you're issued with a booklet of rules and regulations what you're allowed to were not allowed to do this is a typical evenings entertainment there's always a band of Royal Marines so wherever the traveled royal family they could always have music these are menus from the Royal Yacht they're just the same as any of the palace well the Royal yachts a floating palace anyway and it's similar sort of food which will get Buckingham Palace the only difference between there's a picture of the Royal Yacht on the actual menu card by the time she left service in 1997 Britannia had sailed more than a million miles and visited 135 countries on a typical voyage five chefs from the royal household would travel - it was fantastic traveling the world if I didn't work for the royal family I would never have had that opportunity this is the cabin where I used to steer his cubby number 45 it's not a bad-size cabin compared to what some of the naval personnel had to stay in there - stay like three or four people in a room this size means household stuff we had our own cabin not quite the height of luxury but it's a Duke I think he was so tired at night that she could have slept on a clothesline telling the truth britannia is now on permanent show in edinburgh and the royal galley is still in full working order today I'm going to cook rack of lamb Dewberry it's one of the main cost is offer a royal menu all the Royal menus are written in French this is Kerry Daniel which means rack of lamb and the garnish Davari normally anything Dewberry is with cauliflower this time it's with the cauliflower cheese and it's with french beans barrel-shaped roast potatoes and it's served with a red wine and rosemary gravy the first job is to do the rock a lamb so first of all just season it with a little bit of salt and pepper this is English lamb when they're all the family are at Balmoral in Scotland if there's a special type of land at the abbot's site it's called Sai sheep it was quite nice for a bit lamp that just goes into the hot pan we want to seal the meat on the outside we don't want the bones to burn in the oven so just wrap a little bit of tinfoil around that's it between 20 minutes laughter now it depends on the size of the record it's not the biggest kitchen in the world it gets a little bit cramped and it gets very hot when you're cooking in the tropics it can be quite difficult when you when you're at sea cooking if it's really really rough you would be confined to your quarters you wouldn't really be able to cook and then the royal family they would be airlifted off even in the tropics the royal family insist on familiar favorites to eat like the humble roast potato Chateau potatoes they classically supposed to have seven sides they're just quite difficult because to quite fiddly have some great times on here you do feel a bit a bit silently coming back on it because I still like it when it was at sea so food on board Britannia was just like back home but when the Royals venture - or it was a different story well when the Queen's on tour and she goes to some very exotic places as you know she or obviously will have to eat the food at the country and she has been presented with some fairly exotic and strange dishes as indeed they all have take this occasion in Tonga where his royal hungriness the King all twenty-eight stones of him laid on a huge feast a day of sumptuous Polynesian hospitality watermelons sweet potatoes crayfish and 400 suckling pigs slaughtered especially for the occasion the Queen was offered her very own suckling pig which she managed to decline politely but things got slightly trickier on a trip to Central America I remember in 1985 she was in Belize and she was going to be served a rat for dinner in fact it was something that the Belizeans called a Knik ulis packer which is a jib knot but when you actually look at the definition of what that is that means it's a rat great big long thing she really pushed her food from the plate that night back on Britannia and that rack of lamb the red wine and rosemary sauce is now underway so this sauce this has been made with onions carrots celery and leek you then add tomato puree sprinkling a flour red wine half a bottle should do it the next stage is to add some beef stock you then add the bones from the language have been browned off three sprigs of rosemary and then I need to leave that to simmer the Royals enjoyed lamb cooked on board Britannia and learned to be wary when apparently offered it elsewhere take this feast on a Middle Eastern trip they were served this exotic Arabian feast with lots of strange things mostly meat we couldn't quite tell and of course the great tradition is that you serve the guests of honor sheep's eyes I didn't see Diana touching me it was a great joke that would she or didn't she dad had just sort of got out of it beautifully charmingly by just giggling I'll now just do the extra fine beans top and tell them just take the bottoms off and then it will be cut in half it's quite important for the royal family because if there's an important dinner can't be seen with beans hanging out of your mouth so it's got to be quite delicate a meeting with the Pope in 2000 was all smiles but there was outrage in the Italian press when it emerged that the Queen had made it known that she wouldn't eat pasta tomato sauce or garlic oh no the the Queen doesn't like anything like that she's very ambitious in her days I think it's a fairly obvious reasons that if you're talking to somebody the last thing you need is sort of Suede's of garlic breathed all over you I tried to be with the Queen she's got impeccable taste garlic and onions should be abolished the Italians didn't realize that Her Majesty had also said non grazie to the local mineral water she doesn't trust the local water at all not even the bottle variety she takes crates and crates of more than water with that she likes her tea made with more than water because she can't run risks of getting ill anywhere and ruining the tour usually these twos have planned two or three years in advance so you know for that reason she doesn't eat a seafood when she's abroad because you know it's a bit risky the state visit to China in 1986 brought a worried look from her majesty and it wasn't just the prospect of chopsticks on her plate was that favorite Chinese delicacy the slimy sea slug things they do for England Graham is making a cheese sauce for the cauliflower Du Barry no cheddar here just freshly grated Gruyere the thing that published six out of my mind about cooking on board was the long days used to have to be up at six o'clock in the morning start work for half six prepare royal breakfast and after that royal lunch afternoon tea and then dinner didn't really get a break until maybe ten o'clock at night and when you're on board for maybe a month at a time it can be really hard work royal food is always labor intensive for example you couldn't just serve any old cauliflower cheese there has to be a twist so now what I've got to do is prepare the Dubarry garnish for the lamp and it's a cauliflower florets and you get a nice clean white napkin just place it inside and squeeze it and it takes out most of the moisture and you also end up with a nice neat like miniature cauliflower well there's one it's a lot of effort for a piece of cauliflower but I think it's worth in the end presentation wise at this stage you have to get everything out on time timing has got to be absolutely spot-on you can't have the Queen waiting now we've got our cheese sauce so I need to do now is just not be at the top of the cauliflower nefarious means cover them so they're just like individual miniature cauliflower this is cauliflower cheese a lot Royalle sprinkle a little bit of Parmesan cheese on top and that has to go under the grill the Queen Mum in Venice a chance too good to miss for the paparazzi the gondolier with the red headband approached the Cornetto was exchanged got a handshake so did his mate and the object was whisked away by the entourage who didn't think it as funny as everyone else did the Italians may be good at making ice cream but the Royal chefs know a thing or two as well there's nothing wrong with ice cream out of a tub but it's much much better for you if you can then if you can make your own so now I've got ten egg yolks now I need two pints of thick cream this cream would normally come from the Royal dairy it's the thickest cream I've ever seen the Windsor cream and to that I will add five ounces of sugar so what we have to do now is bring this to the boil so now the creams come to the boil just pour it onto the egg yolks but you've got to whisk all the time and fire it on slowly once it's thoroughly mixed in you have to pour the mixture back into the pan and just reheat it slowly just so it thickens a little and coats the back of a spoon when that's cooled down I'm going to add the plum puree that I've made and I've made this by skewing two pounds of garden plums with a little bit of lemon rind some sugar and a drop of water just to make it a nice thick sauce like that that's the Royal ice cream machine I've got my thumb ice cream in there now it's freezing it and at the same time it's whipping it as well this is how the Royals have their ice cream presented all the time the royal family time to finish off the main course the presentation is very important so I'll just discard the end couple of pieces of lamb and just get the ones from the middle with a real nice Ayad meat when you've been entertained by the royal family I think that people have very high expectations so it's got to be absolutely perfect that lambs lovely and pink lovely and juicy and now it's ready to serve these aren't terribly big portions because royal family quite often the five meals a day it's better to be everything that you've got on your plate and ask for a little more if you want some rather than leave some that's the etiquette just drizzle a little bit of the sauce over and there we have real saddle of lamb Dewberry Ally Royale being on the royal yacht was really hard work I've never been at sea before so I liked it occasionally the royal family would go out for lunch maybe to a government house or something so you got a break then and got to have a look around it was an exciting time every summer the Queen and her family had north to Scotland royal chef Greg Newbold used to join them more often than that I would come in mid-july so between six to ten weeks and that would be two to look after and cook for the royal family at Balmoral everything will be shipped up from looking and Palace it would be packed up by the kitchen staff all the kitchen equipment and then it would be puts in army troops and the army trucks would travel overnight Balmoral is a throwback to a culinary age long since gone Balmoral is full of antlers they seem to be everywhere sprouting at you the season is whether it's salmon fishing or stalking or shooting they will eat what they kill is vast vegetable gardens and the Queen has a herd of Highland cattle so they're very self-sufficient the royal family could choose anywhere in the world to holiday but since Queen Victoria's time they've always headed for Deeside they forged a unique culinary connection with the Glen and it's people take the tiny village of ballot er it seems every shop here has a warrant to supply the castle the village bakery is amongst them bread from here is sent up to what's called the big house a loaf or rather the middle of one is needed for the first meal of the day this is a crouton that I'm making it's to serve the poached eggs on for Royal breakfast like that and then you take a smaller cutter and put it inside like that right through with a little one I wonder if I'd scoop out the middle so it looks like an empty bowl of on case and the poached egg will just Nestle on top of it and what goes with the Queen's poached egg well this is Michael Sheridan's butcher shop in Balladur he's a royal warrant holder and supplier of the Royal sausages with a huge ring just we do have a beef and Guinness with a pork can find up all we do work in Apple venison is a very popular one as well so what's the secret of sausages fit for a queen the finest mincemeat isn't the only thing you need special blend of seasonings a good quality let go what what up make it bang together it's no sausage meat the sausages are good to bomb all exactly the same sausages you can buy in the show oh and another thing the casing it's a traditional one not for the faint-hearted some people use a synthetic skin we like to stick to the natural product which is huge enough which gives you one huge - sausage - then make ended links of sausage these cities are definitely fit for any king or queen so even in Scotland a full English breakfast but even this choice doesn't satisfy all the Royals Prince Charles he has wealthier option he would have all made bread a ball of fresh fruit fresh fruit juices and wherever the Prince goes in the world the breakfast box goes with him is six different types of honey some special muesli his dried fruit and anything that's a bit special that is quite fussy about 40 miles from Balmoral in Aberdeen the morning's catch is being unloaded fish suppliers from across Britain bid for the fish but among the crowd is a man who is less concerned with the price market is top quality real fresh fish quality is not there I will not buy the fish ken watt moe is a fishmonger to the Royals well what we got here is flight think it's a lovely fish and it's one of the fish I send up Royal decide what I'm looking for is firm flesh and also the very bright eyes that the fish should have also the other feature should be bright red gills rather than a grayish color these are excellent condition fish from his small shop in aberdeen ken has supplied fish to Balmoral for 16 years on the wall inside hang royal warrants for the Prince of Wales and the late Queen Mother who had her own house on D side called Burke Hall one of the favorite dishes of Her Majesty the Queen Mother was meddling on Kaleo and is based on this fish which is fighting take the fish and remove its back fins it's lower fins and on the underside and clean the inside out and take out the gills the next step is then to a little incision up the back of the head we then remove the skin totally down one side and then down the other side like such and we then lined up with the finished product which we then cuddle the tail of the fish into its mouth and the dish becomes Marilyn in French for whiting alquiler meaning in anger it's a dish this either baked in the oven or can be poached and then served up with a drizzle of white sauce around the fish but there's one fish that's really synonymous with royal Deeside and particularly Prince Charles and that's the salmon Prince Charles used to go fishing around five o'clock in the evening for a couple of hours and maybe till about seven o'clock although is a fantastic fisherman there were times when he never used to catch a fish so I would always have fun sparing the ladder just in case if Prince Giles was successful in catching a salmon he used to bring it into the kitchen and we will discuss the method of cooking with a salmon of such quality straight out of the river I think it's it's best not to spoil it just plain porch with a nice sauce hollandaise and that's fantastic the Queen maintains a royal tradition of having a piper to play her into dinner whenever she's at Balmoral Graham is cooking at fast house the country seat of the Gladstone family nearby so first of all you have to take off the head by going behind the fin then lifts up the belly and you have to press your knife against the back well and with the sewing action just tip one side of the phyllis off it's very important to get these small pin bones out because you don't want anyone to get a bomb stuck in the throat the Queen Mother once had a problem with that the next stage is to take the skin off just slide in your sharp knife underneath the flesh and press it all the way down against the skin so it comes away nice and clean just like that I'll now portion it up there we are and now the best thing is we've got to go and cook it they have such an abundance of it that they restrict the amount of times they eat a tea tree it used to be like the staff in the old days they'd have it written into their contract that you'd only have to eat oysters and salmon twice a week because it was considered peasant food then and now of course it's mentally expensive particularly wild salmon their salt supply grains of pepper you have to make sure that their summons completely covered with the cooking liquor and that will approach between seven and ten minutes the poaching liquor is dry white wine water and white wine vinegar with celery leeks carrots and shallots a bay leaf and peppercorns and flavor I'm now going to make the hollandaise sauce what I've done here is separate four eggs I don't need the whites I just need the yolks what I've got in this small pan is a drop of white wine vinegar some white wine some sliced shallots for peppercorns and the bay leaf I reduce it down until there's only a spoonful of liquid left and we add that to the egg yolks and that's the flavoring for the hollandaise sauce why we do it over boiling water is to cook the eggs through and to make it nice and fluffy it's what we call a sabayon in the trade and then once the Savion de nice and fluffy then I'll add some clarified butter verified butter is what does it be melted slowly and it's just the fact that you want on the top with lemon juice peanut in and that's the hollandaise sauce done show you how the royal family like the carrots take the carrots and lightly scrape them most of the vegetables come from royal palaces kitchen gardens the ones at Balmoral obviously bigger than the ones that Highgrove i mean said that the Prince of Wales has probably got a better variety of vegetable I'm now going to finish the salmon off by sprinkling some samphire around it's also known as sea asparagus all you do with that is drop it in water for about one minute and then take it out and add a little bit of butter to it so there we have porch filler of salmon with hollandaise sauce cook this dish many times for the royal family I think they enjoy it especially when they're in Scotland Scottish salmon it's the best you can get for Prince Charles it's not just salmon that he's particular about even when he's in Scotland for goodness sake he won't eat the vegetables he will actually have them brought in from Highgrove in about 600 miles away daily same when he's abroad Highgrove is the prince's country estate in Gloucestershire it's not only his house it's the place where he puts his most controversial ideas on food into practice that's true he does get a lot of pleasure in telling people that the food they're eating has come from the estate it gives him a lot of pleasure what happens at home farm on the Highgrove estate has made the Prince of Wales Britain's foremost ambassador for organic produce home farm was set up in 1985 the farm is something that he feels passionate about the more you find out about organic farming systems the more you realize it's just common sense and good husbandry he was a very early advocate of this movement and I can see why I mean he thinks it's healthier and he thinks it's much tastier large black pigs that we got on the farm are a rare breed the Prince of Wales is patron the rare breeds trust so we're really doing our bit by keeping a small gene pool of purebred pigs they are very very fat which is why they've become unfashionable but the bacon that you get from them is absolutely fantastic it's different to anything you could buy today Prince of Wales really likes that bacon I have to say the Prince has now taken his organic campaign and the produce from home farm into the high street he donates the profits to his own Charitable Trusts is a very rich man I mean he gets all his income from the Duchy of Cornwall and the latest figures showed that that was very nearly 8 million pounds last year so he can afford to have these sort of expensive fancy ideas which others can't afford when Graham was asked to be the personal chef to The Prince and Princess of Wales Highgrove became his weekend home with so much organic produce on hand it was an exhilarating job and the atmosphere was much less formal if the prince or princess would have been a smaller setup if they wanted anything different or anything special they were normally come into the kitchen and speak to you Diana brought new ideas to the Royal kitchens soon the talk was a bj peas or baked jacket potatoes as they're better known in this pan have some Greenland prawns in a cheese sauce some of this goes in the bottom on top of the prawns because a soft poached egg you will then take your mashed potato and just pipe it around carefully the Princess of Wales was a great fan of this type of thing the Prince of Wales not so much but he wouldn't try them on occasions drizzle a little bit of cheese sauce over the egg like so and sprinkle on top a little Parmesan cheese and then these were in the hot oven for ten minutes the best way probably is just to have it with a nice avocado salad with a nice vinaigrette dressing even really simple food can be made quite special until Diana came along and took her boys to McDonald's you never never saw members of the royal family gain a fast-food joints never but you know that's part of normal life and she wanted to keep her boys in touch with reality today young Royals like Prince Harry are often spotted at Polo tucking into the same things as other youngsters he obviously was looking for something more substantial to eat than the dainty little cucumber sandwiches that his grandma was serving at the Pavilion Stanny or cucumber sandwich you have to peel the cucumber you never serve anything with seeds into the royal family there's probably never even seen a cucumber seed the best way to cut the red for the sandwiches is to just put it in the freezer for about 15 minutes just so it kills and it's much easier to slice there particularly like the red really really thin just a turn of pepper and stack them up so the perfect the royal family when the Romans Square sandwiches they always have the corners cut off his tradition it goes back a long time in the olden days if you served anything to the monarch that had a point on it it meant that he was trying to overthrow the throne so they still do it with the sandwiches Graham Newbold was personal chef to the Prince and Princess of Wales for four and a half years he went to work for them after helping cook at one of the most famous Royal occasions of all probably the the best souvenir that I have I guess it was like the pinnacle of my career working on the Royal Wedding is an actual piece of royal wedding cake there's the actual cake at the bottom and there's the lid for the box all the world loves a wedding and nothing beats a royal one the wedding breakfast consisted of quenelles of brill and with the lobster sauce that was the first course that was followed by restive chicken which was stuff for the lamb mousse with brioche bread crumbs a minted cream sauce and samsaya while the royal family were leaving Buckingham Palace for some Paul's Cathedral Graham and the rest of the kitchen crew had their minds firmly focused on the lobster sauce for the starter it's dead easy to do take the flowers off first and then take the head off the meats in the tail and also in the class it might seem a lot of hassle but if you want a proper taste in lobster sauce this is the only way to do it lobster sauce is the essence of luxury along with the lobster shell go wine brandy stock and cream to simmer down before being saved the meat from the lobster tail is to be used as a garnish but first graham has a small but vital job to do in the tail is an intestine and you need to get that out with a cocktail stick you really really don't want to send on some of the most famous people in the world and you don't want to give them a bad tummy or anything outside the groom was on his way in the kitchens they had no time to wave him off we didn't really have time to think about all the festivities that were going on it was getting a cold down and you had a job to do the individual Brill noses are a delicate operation the fish is blended with egg white and cream and it mustn't separate before being served this is the real moose which I'm now farming into what's known as Quinn Elle's still got to pretend the chicken and prepare the lamb mousse and the chicken sauce as well so it's quite hectic but most weddings it's the bride and her mother who make all the decisions but Lady Diana Spencer had little or no say in the menu for her wedding breakfast it was a state occasion and the food was chosen by the Queen this is the lamb mousse that will be used as a filling for the chicken when this is finished it will look something like a chicken Kiev but without the garlic it'll have bland mousse inside the bride may not have chosen the menu but she did have the main course named after her supreme duvall I can test the gal it's not a traditional dish this particular dish was made especially for the day in honor of the Princess of Wales its breast of chicken princess well I've got areas of a moose that's been put in a piping bag and it's just piped into the envelope you then place the flat and fill it on top and then fold the ends over so the Moose is totally encased all the way around hundreds of millions watched the service on television two and a half thousand crammed into the Cathedral but only a lucky 120 would sit down to enjoy the wedding-breakfast Royal Family's riaj for breadcrumbs which is a cemented bundle it's very lights then just cut the cross off and slice it thin you can smell the sweetness of the brioche crumbs I Diana Francis take the Charles Philip Arthur drawn to my wedded husband the blushing bride got the groom's name her model she won the hearts of a nation a mistake in the Royal kitchen Oz would only place added pressure on the chef's if anything had have been wrong we would have had some some more fish in reserve to start again we would just have to panic a little bit and work a little bit faster yeah is the stuff of which fairytales are made so there we have it who knows of brill with lobster sauce followed by chicken stuffed with the lamb mousse demented

-1,well any any genetic disorder is an interaction with the environment so I don't exclude environment I just don't see yet any strong evidence for a particular environmental factor I think that one could do studies for example one could go to third world countries and do a study and ask is the rate of autism they are the same as it is in the developed countries no one has done a study that I know of of that type but it certainly could be done that would answer that question but certainly anything having to do with with the development of an organism has an environmental component to it but you can only study that when there's when there's some evidence which enables you to isolate that environmental component I think the vaccine studies have been now largely discredited they took mercury out of the vaccine and this rates of autism didn't change and now of the 12 all authors of the original paper they've got some people very excited I think 11 of those 12 authors have now withdrawn their backing for that paper and the the methods used in that paper are really in doubt so I I don't take it as any as there being any evidence that vaccines is such an environmental factor it's unfortunate that the age at which parents begin to recognize autism and their children often correlates with the age at which they receive vaccinations that's the unfortunate thing there is a portion of the autism probably the majority of autism where you can detect it very early once then the child is almost that's almost after the child is born many parents of autistic children say that they could tell very early on that there's something wrong with your child there are about a quarter of the cases of autism where it looks like the child in the parents opinion has been developing normally and then to their mind suddenly goes off course and I think at least 5% of cases it's it's been very well documented that actually a child has begun to lose gains that they have made so there is this component that's very tragic when parent feels relieved that they've gotten through and I think every parent who has a child suffers through nightmares that you know hoping that their child will be healthy and they give birth to a healthy child and then you know at age 2 or 3 the child suddenly stops developing that's tragedy of horrendous proportions and it's natural for the parents of such children to look around for the possible causes something external however should be borne in mind that our brains continuously are developing at that age and it is well known that there are genetic defects whose onsets can occur at almost any particular age for example there are class of disorders that are called storage disorders where the child develops normally but because of the build up of some compound due to the faulty metabolism of some essential thing that they eat every day builds up to a point and then begins to poison the brain and these in these cases a child will develop normally up to a certain age and then will often regress and sometimes will died so the idea that you know you can't have sudden onset of an illness when the child's 2 or 3 is is just as wrong if there were you know clear environmental signal for example sonograms or too much television or vaccinations you know that would be something that one could study but in the absence of evidence for that you have to ask yourself well what should we be looking for should it be the plastic and bomb and I don't think we can do that in our culture I don't think we can look for these possible environmental insults they're just far too many but if you go to a place you know like Nepal or Mongolia or some places whose environment is completely different they don't have television they still have grandmothers raising the children they don't get sonograms you could begin to tease out and do you know what epidemiologists do they go and do cultural comparisons so for example cultural comparisons have told us the incidence of breast cancer in Japan is 1/3 the rate of the incidence of breast cancer in America and when Japanese women grow up in America their rate of breast cancer is the same as American women okay you can say the environment possibly including culture in some way because of the rate the age of which you undergo puberty is is relevant to breast cancer has a study like that been done for autism no that's where you would start and none of that's been done as far as I know

-1,"Crash Course Philosophy is brought to you
 by Squarespace. Squarespace: share your passion with the world. For generations, just about everybody in the
 United States got vaccinations. And I’m sure there will be no conversation
 about this in the comments. And as a result, diseases like measles were
 all but eradicated. But in 1998, a study published in a scientific
 journal linked vaccines with autism. Even though that study was later discredited,
 ever since then, a small but vocal subset of parents have refused
 to vaccinate their kids. Now, measles are back, as is whooping cough, mumps, and other diseases that were nearly wiped out. Children’s lives are being endangered because
 some parents are acting on beliefs that have no scientific evidence to support them. So, why am I talking about this on Crash Course
 Philosophy? Normally, when we talk about responsibility,
 we’re talking about things that you do. But in philosophy, we sometimes face other
 obligations. Some philosophers have argued that we all
 have epistemic responsibility – that is, responsibility we have regarding
 our beliefs. Epistemic responsibility is an especially
 interesting area of philosophy because it’s where many of its sub-disciplines
 overlap – where epistemology brushes up against philosophy
 of religion, which bumps into ethics. And philosophers might argue that we live in a world that could probably use a lot more epistemic responsibility – or at least, more people who understand what
 it is. Anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, conspiracy
 theorists. The world is full of people who hold beliefs
 without any evidence. And not only that, they – like most of us
 – encourage others to share their beliefs. But over the past 200 years or so, philosophers have developed some pretty compelling responses to this phenomenon. A few thinkers have come up with useful ways
 of thinking about the beliefs we have, and the harm they can cause, and what responsibilities
 go along with having them. Meanwhile, others have argued that we can
 sometimes hold beliefs without any proof. Not about vaccines, or global warming, or
 the moon landing – but about God. W.K. Clifford lived in England in the mid-1800s, where the only vaccine that existed was for smallpox, and even that earned its share of scorn and
 ridicule at the time. But Clifford, who was both a mathematician
 and a philosopher, would probably have some very strong opinions
 about today’s anti-vaxxers. Because Clifford was one of the leading proponents
 of epistemic responsibility of his time. He most famously, and bluntly, put it this
 way: “It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.” And instead of using vaccinations as an example,
 Clifford told the story of a ship owner. He said, suppose there was a guy who owned a ship that he knew was old and decrepit and hadn’t been inspected in a long time. That ship was scheduled to make a transatlantic voyage, and the owner worried that it might not make it. But, overhauling the ship would be pricey
 and time-consuming. In time, the owner talked himself into believing
 that the ship was seaworthy. The ship set sail. Then it sank.
 And hundreds of people drowned. But, the owner? He collected insurance money from his loss, and no one blamed him for the tragedy. Now, most people would agree that the shipowner was responsible for the deaths of the ship’s passengers. But Clifford went even further. He argued that the owner would have been guilty even if the ship managed to make the trip safely. Because: He was guilty of accepting a belief
 without sufficient evidence, and whether that actually leads to harm or not, he has still done wrong, epistemically and morally. Now, you might argue, “Don’t I have the right to believe whatever I want, as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone?” Yeah, good question. Clifford argued that
 there’s no such thing as a private belief. Because: We all talk about our beliefs – some of us do it a lot – and it causes our beliefs to spread. But even if you never vocalize a belief, it still influences the way you act and the way others perceive you. So in this way, a belief can spread subtly,
 insidiously, without a word being spoken. Think about other kinds of beliefs that lack
 evidence, for example sexist beliefs. Imagine a modern day sexist in an American
 university. Most of these people are gonna know that actually expressing their sexist views isn't going to fly. But a sexist’s beliefs, even if they’re
 never overtly stated, tend to show through in the ways they interact
 with women and speak of them. So, no matter what: You know them and you know their views and you know their views subtly influence others, particularly if they’re a person in position
 of authority or respect. Since our views always have the potential
 to harm others, W. K. Clifford argued that we have an epistemic responsibility only to
 believe things for which we have evidence. And if you don’t have evidence, you’re
 morally obligated to refrain from the belief. Basically, you should withhold judgment until
 you investigate the situation. Let’s head over to the Thought Bubble to
 explore this more with some Flash Philosophy. It’s Tuesday, and your teacher tells you
 that, this week, there will be a pop quiz. And she’s nice enough to even define for
 you what she means by this: A pop quiz, she says, is a quiz that you can’t
 know is coming in advance. You reason, however, that such a quiz is impossible,
 so you never study for it. Here’s your reasoning: The quiz can’t be on Friday, because if
 Wednesday and Thursday go by with no quiz, then you would know it was coming on Friday, since that would be the last possible day. So Friday’s out. But that means it can’t be on Thursday either,
 because by the end of class on Wednesday, you would
 know the quiz would be happening the next day. But since it can’t be on Thursday or Friday, it also can’t be on Wednesday, because that’s the only day left – so you would know in advance that it was coming. Now, any amount of rationalization that will convince you that you don't have to study might sound pretty sweet. But, in this case, you’re probably going
 to regret it. Because, after all, if your teacher tells you there’s going to be a quiz, chances are, there is going to be a quiz. The fact that you’ve constructed a brilliant mind game that proves that it won’t, isn’t going to make that quiz not happen. So, beliefs about vaccines and shipworthiness may be irresponsible because of the danger they pose to others, but this case demonstrates that irresponsible
 beliefs can be damaging to you, as well. Thanks,Thought Bubble! Clifford made a pretty
 convincing case for epistemic responsibility. And it’s worth pointing out that his beef wasn’t only with ship owners or kids who didn’t study. One thing his arguments were meant to show is that religious belief is epistemically irresponsible. Belief in a God whose existence can’t be
 proven was simply “blind faith,” he said. And blind faith leads a person to ignore other facts and arguments, causing them to live an unexamined, unthoughtful life that Clifford described
 as “one long sin against mankind.” Unsurprisingly, this idea was met with some counterarguments. Let’s hear from one of his interlocutors: 19th century American philosopher and psychologist
 William James took issue with Clifford’s thesis that it is immoral to
 believe something with insufficient evidence. James acknowledged that one of his beliefs that was most important to him – his belief in God – lacked evidence. So he set out to demonstrate that certain
 beliefs can be held, morally, even if there’s nothing you can really point
 to, to back them up. Now, James recognized that it would be ridiculous to say it’s ok to believe in just anything you wanted. So he narrowed down his claim to argue that,
 when you adopt a belief, you have options. And the nature of those options can basically determine the moral defensibility of the beliefs you end up holding. Specifically, he said that the options you face when choosing a belief could be either live or dead; forced or unforced;
 And momentous or trivial. You face a live option when you’re considering a belief that you could actually see yourself having. For instance, maybe you’ve never had a pumpkin
 spice latte. But you love pumpkin, and you love lattes,
 and you love spice, so you hypothesize that you would enjoy a
 pumpkin spice latte. That’s a live option for you – because you can imagine yourself believing that you’d like a pumpkin spice latte. On the other hand, you probably can’t even
 entertain the possibility that you’d enjoy, like, a dog food spice latte. Try as you might, you just can’t imagine
 accepting that option as an actual belief. So, that’s a dead option to you. Now, a forced option is one in which, whatever you do, you’ve made a choice. You can’t not choose. ‘Stay in or go out,’ is a good example
 of a forced option. You have to do one or the other; you can’t
 wait and decide later. Because, as you wait to decide, you’ve stayed
 in and thus, you have made your choice. But unforced options are those where you can
 just opt out of choosing. If I let you pick peanut butter or ham and cheese, you can always just decide to have neither. So your choice is an unforced option. A momentous option is one that, if you choose it, stands the chance of radically changing your life for the better. Accepting an opportunity to go to the International
 Space Station, for example, could be momentous. But the option to have French fries with your
 burger would be trivial – eat them, don’t eat them, either way –
 not gonna make a huge difference in your life. Now, James said that, if you’re considering whether to believe something for which there’s not sufficient evidence, it’s permissible to still believe it – so long as it’s a live, forced, and momentous option. And religious belief just happens to fill
 all of those criteria. First, James said, believing in God is a live option for himself and a whole lot of other people. He also argued that religious belief is a
 forced option. That’s because he didn’t buy the idea
 that agnosticism was really a thing. He figured that withholding judgment is the same as not believing – so you either believe in God, or you don’t. Finally, James thought religious belief is momentous – it has the possibility to greatly improve your life. So, he concluded that we are justified in believing in God in the absence of evidence through faith alone. The problem is, if we’re justified in believing
 in God in the absence of evidence, then we’re also justified in believing that
 it’s ok not to vaccinate our kids. Because that, too, is an option that can be
 described as live, forced, and momentous. So unfortunately, philosophy can’t just make all of the baseless beliefs in the world go away. But it can help you argue against those ideas
 intelligently. Today we have learned about epistemic responsibility. Clifford says it is always wrong to believe
 without sufficient evidence, but James says there are some exceptions – namely,
 religious belief. Next time we will consider whether we can
 gamble our way to belief in God – stay tuned! This episode is brought to you by Squarespace. Squarespace helps to create websites, blogs

-1,"for many of us this was a routine childhood experience but now vaccination rates for British children have been falling for four years in a row amid a mixture of complacency misinformation and skepticism the health secretary is considering a drastic change to bring those rates back up again I don't want to see compulsory vaccination and I don't think we're there yet but I've said that we rule nothing out because vaccination saves lives and the fall in the rates of vaccination has to has to stop because the science is absolutely clear and it's settled which is that vaccination is the right thing to do at the roald dahl museum in great miss ndon we've been given access to this letter that the author wrote about his seven-year-old daughter olivia who died from measles before a reliable vaccine was available 24 years after Olivia's death Roald Dahl wrote a letter urging all parents to get their children vaccinated against measles he said I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable vaccine had not been discovered but here at the museum dedicated to his memory there are mixed feelings among parents about compulsory vaccination when it comes to vaccinations in the long run it's going to save them the the National Health Service money because it's going to prevent illnesses in the future I'd just like some more information so that I know that I've made the right choice my children sort of know the long-term implications of using immunization compared to actually using uranium in the system to build its own defenses ultimately the parents with the health authorities I think should should be able to make a decision together last year nearly a thousand cases of measles were recorded in England nearly four times as many as in 2017 over half a million UK children missed out on the MMR vaccine between 2010 and 2017 and nearly 40,000 British parents have joined an online group calling for children to be left unamused in all 50 US states children must be vaccinated in order to attend school with some religious exemptions but despite the complete discrediting of a two decade old study linking one vaccine with autism there's a growing backlash against that law and some are concerned that making vaccination compulsory could have that effect here - I think it just raises the level of anxiety and concern around these sort of issues when we need a calm climate in which nurses and health visitors and doctors can discuss these matters calmly with parents and reassure them over their anxieties about vaccinations which have been raised by publicity over the last few years roald dahl wrote approvingly of America's compulsory system the health Secretary's decision on whether to replicate it here could make all the difference to these children's futures Molly Shattuck Sky News"
-1,"In this video I will demonstrate
 how to administer a subcutaneous
 injection. This route is abbreviated either
 SC or subcut. Vaccines should be
 prepared in a designated area that is not adjacent to any area
 where potentially contaminated
 items are placed. CDC recommends that providers
 prepare vaccines just prior
 to administration. Before preparing or
 administering any vaccine always
 start with proper hand hygiene. CDC has hand hygiene guidelines
 and resources for health care
 personnel available online. ♪ The appropriate site for a
 subcutaneous injection depends
 soley on the patient's age. For infants younger than
 12 months the recommended
 subcutaneous site is the fatty tissue over the anterolateral
 thigh. If needed the fatty
 tissue over the triceps area of the upper arm can also
 be used. For persons 12 months
 of age and older the recommended site is the fatty tissue over
 the triceps area of the upper
 arm. Begin by removing the
 vaccine from the storage unit. Next
 gather the appropriate supplies.
 This includes a syringe and needle. Use a 23 to 25 gauge 5/8
 inch needle for subcutaneous
 injections regardless of the age or the size of the patient. Also
 gather prepackaged sterile
 alcohol wipes and bandages Needles and syringes may be
 packaged together or separately.
 Verify the vaccine you are preparing matches the standing
 order or the provider's order.
 Then check the expiration date. Never administer expired
 vaccine. Shirts with
 tight-fitting sleeves that
 cannot be rolled up should be removed. Sometimes
 a patient may have a tattoo
 located on the injection site. Subcutaneous injections may be
 given through a tattoo. With the
 entire site clearly visible check for lumps, swelling,
 redness, warmth, bruising, or
 wounds near the injection site. Next cleanse the injection site
 with a sterile alcohol wipe
 using a circular motion, starting at the center and
 working outward. Let it dry.
 Now hold the syringe in your dominant hand and remove the
 protective cover from the needle
 with your other hand. With your non-dominant hand pinch up some
 fatty tissue. With your dominant
 hand hold the syringe and insert the needle into the fatty tissue
 at a 45 degree angle. Inject all
 the vaccine. Once administered enable the safety sheath and
 discard the used syringe and
 needle into a sharps container.
 Apply an adhesive bandage to the
 injection site if there is any
 bleeding. Note: in this demonstration I did not aspirate
 or pull back on the plunger to
 check for blood. According to the Advisory Committee on
 Immunization Practices
 aspiration is not necessary before administering a vaccine
 because no large blood vessels
 are present at the recommended injection sites. A 2007 study
 from Canada compared injection
 techniques with and without aspiration and found that an
 injection that includes
 aspiration might be more painful to infants. No adverse events
 were reported with either
 injection technique.
 Immunization providers should be aware of the
 potential for syncope or
 fainting following vaccination. Providers should have the
 patient seated or lying down
 when administering vaccines. They should also be aware of
 symptoms that precede fainting
 such as weakness, dizziness and pallor, and provide supportive
 care if symptoms occur.
 Providers should consider observing patients, especially
 adolescents, for 15 minutes
 after vaccination. During this observation period
 patients should be seated or
 lying down to reduce the risk of injury associated with syncope.
 CDC has injection safety
 resources for health care personnel available online at
 www.cdc.gov/injectionsafety This video is part of a series
 designed to demonstrate vaccine
 administration skills and best practices. The video is
 available on the Vaccine
 Administration web page on the CDC Vaccines and Immunizations
 website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines"
-1,hi I'm dr. David Hill and today we're going to talk about hepatitis B vaccine side effects in infants now a lot of people ask me do I need to get my infant vaccinated against hepatitis B they're not going to use IV drugs they're not going to have sex with anybody why are we doing this now instead of later and I want to start by saying that while we do understand how hepatitis B is transmitted in some cases yes IV needle sharing yes sexual contact many cases of hepatitis B the means of transmission to the victim is completely unknown hepatitis B is a very easy virus to contract and it kills a lot of the people who contract it some people survive but not everyone does there are some treatments for it but the treatments are not great a lot of them don't work for everybody who gets them so the only way to really protect people against hepatitis B is to get the vaccine why do we give it to infants people say do you really want to give my infant a vaccine before he or she even leaves the hospital that's crazy well it's not because this is the one that actually works that early as the immune system matures it takes some vaccines awhile for the immune system to have matured to a point where the vaccine is effective that's why we give them at the time so that we do hepatitis B vaccine actually works that early and the risks really do start that early for contracting hepatitis B and even dying of the disease so we want to protect infants starting on day of life one why because we can so what do you want to be concerned about when you want to be on the lookout for when you're thinking about hepatitis B vaccine for your infant well the most common reaction is probably pain at the injection site that's not a big surprise vaccines do create an immune response there can be some inflammation that occurs in about one in every 11 children or adolescents who get the hepatitis B vaccine the second most common reaction is to get a little bit of mild fever usually it's not over about a hundred 101 it doesn't last more than a day or two but that fever may occur and about one in 14 children or adolescents who get the vaccine so be on the lookout for that now I want to say a little something about fever and newborns right here if your newborn has a rectal temperature greater than 100 point 4 degrees Fahrenheit or greater than 38 degrees Celsius you want to get that newborn to a doctor immediately in the first three months of life that may be a really emergent problem so just because they got a hepatitis B vaccine yesterday doesn't mean that a fever today is okay in the first three months of life after that you can relax at least some about fever now what about really serious side effects the good news here is that serious side effects aren't incredibly rare from the hepatitis B vaccine but what would you be looking for you'd be looking for an allergic reaction you can have an allergic reaction of course to just about anything that enters the body and the signs of allergic reaction are fast heart rate difficulty breathing a red itchy raised rash all over the body sometimes faintness or extreme irritability those are symptoms which whether or not you got a hepatitis B vaccine would be really alarming were they to occur so your best shot is to call your baby's doctor immediately and let him figure out what's going on it may have been the vaccine it may have been something completely different but that baby wants care regardless obviously if your baby is having breathing trouble you may even want to activate emergency medical services and get some help immediately in the United States you do that by calling 9-1-1 so talking about potential reactions to the hepatitis B vaccine in your infant I'm dr. David Hill
0,a growing anti-vaccine movement in the United States has health officials concerned that deadly infectious diseases like measles rubella and whooping cough could return anti vaccine activists claim a link between immunizations and autism the medical establishment says there's no scientific evidence backing that theory still some parents are opting out teresa rangam is the executive director of the National Vaccine Information Center which is dedicated to preventing vaccine injuries and deaths through public education Teresa thanks so much for joining me via Skype today from Colorado tell me why you got involved in this in this fight and in this issue well partially because as a child I had a severe vaccine reaction and I had questions about what that might predispose my children to and it was very difficult to find a physician actually have that conversation with who actually had any knowledge of how the genetic predisposition that might have triggered my reaction may be inherited or not inherited by my children so it was it was a journey to find out more yeah and did you did you decide to vaccinate your kids my kids are fully backstage of three and then when I saw the research and the gaps in research I'm in terms of risk I decided to step back because in the meantime my husband had also had a severe reaction so I think we fall in that population that the Institutes of medicine talks about in terms of special populations where there's a research gap to tell us you know a little bit more about what our risks might be and so I mean the vast majority of research on vaccine shows that they've been effective going back to the 1700 you had the smallpox vaccine but even with that there's always some skepticism people believe that a small pack smallpox vaccine back then would actually turn them into a cow that of course didn't happen it saved lives I mean do you have information to suggest otherwise that these vaccines that have proven to be pretty effective at eradicating diseases actually or pose some sort of a life-threatening risk well they can post life-threatening risks if you're not aware of it there is the federal vaccine injury compensation fund that fund was created because our federal government acknowledged that there's no such thing as a hundred percent safe or effective vaccine there are those that get injured our group actually put in place some of these safety provisions that exist in the federal law that created that program in terms of whatever it is do I have to suggest that there were issues you have to look no further than the Institutes of medicine last two reports the last report looked at the safety of the recommended schedule for children in general and the statements that they came out with in essence were that you know while vaccines are largely safe there are people with individual susceptibilities for whom the risk may be that they get hurt or that they're even died as a result of a vaccine nearly and so are you also someone who believes there's a connection between these vaccines particularly MMR measles mumps and rubella and autism am i someone who personally believes right yes I personally believe that you know autism is a behavioral diagnosis it's not a medical condition can it create comeback scenes creating encephalopathy that the total outcome may be autism we already know that's true Hannah pullings is the perfect example she had an underlying mitochondrial condition and the end outcome from the exacerbation of vaccines was autism so you're not me if you're if you're a child who's who has a sort of is sort of pre exposed to something or has some sort of underlying medical condition that may be a vaccine could exacerbate that well the Institute's of Medicine says that it doesn't really matter what I believe Institutes of management right there are several times I'm just clarifying what you're what you're saying yes that's what I'm saying and it doesn't matter that I'm saying and I think more importantly the Institute's of Medicine is saying it what M VI C stands for is informed consent we're not an anti vaccine organization what we want consumers to realize is you know like any medical procedure and vaccination is a medical procedure there's risk involved there's risk involved if you decide not to vaccinate you're talking about what level of risk are you willing to accept as a consumer and in terms of risk your what you bring to the table for example in terms of risk I couldn't even begin to tell you I'm not going to tell you you should vaccinate or you shouldn't vaccinate you should have a talk with some with a trusted health person in your life a doctor whoever you're going to about vaccines you should talk about what what is it to the table right what do you say to doctors and scientists who say not getting a vaccine actually puts the sort of larger public at risk especially when you're talking about school school-aged children who were in classrooms and in schools I would say you know look at what happened in Washington the pertussis outbreak people were vaccinated in fact the CDC has come out very clearly and said that that outbreak is not being driven by people who choose not to vaccinate or choose alternative schedules in vaccination and yet they're being demonized they're being used at as example even though the CDC has been very clear that it's a failure of the vaccine and not a failure to vaccinate it's a what would you say I mean what sort of information do you think you need from scientists were you aware you would feel like you could be in the position to counsel people to get vaccines and to say the vaccines were safe the MMR vaccine for instance well gaps in is not our mission our mission is not to convince people to vaccinate and our mission is to get people to understand that when they decide that it's very important that they understand the risks and the benefits just like any medical procedure there are risk and benefits and very often with regard to vaccination it's very easy to find the benefit information it's very difficult to find the risk information and that is one of the reasons our website focuses on that we want to provide one place where somebody can go and get both we do focus on risk but we link to the FDA and the CDC a lot of what we linked to you is scientifically based and you can go read it for yourself we link to the most recent institute of medicine's paper that talked about the different levels of risk that we know and the many that are unknown and that require additional research and until that research is in I think you have to let parents make that decision informed consent is not about coercion and telling someone do this because I'm telling you to it's about you as an individual being a savvy consumer gathering that risk benefit information deciding how does it affect you as an individual what risks do you bring by virtue you are right I just you know you you talk about sort of gaps in the science I just wonder if there ever will be enough science out there to have people feel like they can make enough of an informed that's a valid point in terms of you know science is always going to be playing catch-up I think that's a fair point however I want to give you an idea of the scope of what I'm talking about the answers especially if you can okay the Institutes of Medicine did a review of the most common reported vaccine reactions 158 for 85 percent of that or 135 what they saw was there was not enough quality science or an absence of science for them to determine whether or not the vaccine reaction that was reported was indeed caused by the vaccine that's not good news that means that we're falling behind we're not looking at it people need to know does this reaction is it caused by that vaccine for the 15% that they had adequate science to say yes or no on over half 78 percent favored yes that vaccine Cod caused X reaction those are big gaps those are not small gaps and they should not be ignored and the people who are injured you know our our injury threesome oh I'm gonna have to cut you up you've been you know informative I appreciate you for us sitting here with me today and talking about your organization good luck thank you all right take care dr. Corey a bear is the CEO of black health TV and assistant professor at Louisiana State University's Health Sciences Center dr. a bear he wrote a study on the impact of X on public health and he joins me now thanks so much dr. bear dr. Corey I'm gonna call you dr. Cory Ali's did you're a doctor you heard what Teresa had to say there it seems like she's suggesting a that their gaps in terms of the scientific research around vaccines and that there's a certain segment of the population of it maybe should be afraid of vaccines what do you think a couple of things here number one we can use common sense and I think a lot of people don't use common sense we can think about when is the last time you saw somebody walking around with polio you haven't have you and the reason why is because of vaccines people don't realize that 1.5 million people died in the United States alone in one year from the same influenza that we have today what I find is that pop culture icons like Jenny McCarthy and a couple of others have used a dr. Wakefield well let's just back up his name is mr. Wakefield now because he's not a doctor anymore this study back in 1989 that made the link between autism and and MMR exactly and so that's the only guy that's ever said this but on this tirade about this and the problem is that you can't really take all that stuff back because it hit the pop culture so quickly now let's look at the facts here the America may not even be here without vaccinations and sanitation because of all of the the serious diseases that have been almost eradicated because of vaccinations there your guest said that you know it's very important that people understand the risks and the benefits and then he just sound informed consents well in the United States it's against the law for me to give you a vaccine without you signing an informed consent already that's already law in every state so you have to get the risk and the benefits we even have to give you some information in your hand on paper right that you understand about the risks and benefits so what are the dangers here you talk about this sort of pop culture anti-vaccine movement that's afoot that in some ways has led by folks like Jenny McCarthy what are the risks here if people buy into this idea that vaccines are a threat to their children I mean I think the rates are something like eighty five to ninety nine percent across the country pair vaccinate their kids but in smaller communities and places like Colorado folks are opting out right I mean that's like she mentioned New York outbreak of pertussis that was said that was penned to have been done because of a inactive vaccine but let's talk about the Los Angeles pertussis outbreak that was only because of people not getting vaccinated the risks are in infection obviously the risks are a pain at the injection site all the risks that we talk about there's even a risk called guillain-barre a syndrome that can cause you to have some paralysis in your body and and I'm not ever gonna take those things away but those things have been risk for that risk of vaccination from the beginning of time right okay that's nothing new that the thing that actually made this whole vaccination outcry was a physician in Britain who has been totally debunked on why he thinks vaccines should not be administered because you can it can you know cause your child to have autism which is untrue do you sense that there's anything at all to learn from folks who are skeptical about vaccines if you look at the polio vaccine for instance there was a early on there was an incident where somebody got the polio vaccine and the the effects weren't good also they changed it from a live vaccine to an inactive vaccine right I mean is there any sort of template for that of being true now with the citizens of vaccine skeptics well you know I'll tell you like this I mean we are always trying to advance science that's important and granted you know with the polio vaccine there was an oral polio vaccine but we don't give that vaccine emore we give the inactivated injectable polio vaccine so what I want parents to do is to to just talk to your grandmother talk to your great-grandmother and ask her about smallpox yeah and ask her how many of her friends died from it in a skirt why are you resting on the laurels of our ancestors because you don't want to vaccinate your children because you're listed in Jenny McCarthy and a debunk doctor that's what I want them to do so is it a matter now of just like a PR war that you've got Jenny McCarthy maybe on one side and doctors and science and folks like you on the other yes there are and there are some real you know Charlotte's and physicians that are that are pandering to their audiences that that that want to have that that really flowery type of a pediatric practice where you do whatever you want yeah you know you can get a vaccine here you're gonna have to get a vaccine there they have a lot of those physicians out there and you know what we don't really accept them in our real scientific part of what we're doing here and like I say to you it's very clear that there are risks associated with anything the number one cause of death from overdose in America is Tylenol you don't care you don't read the risks on Tylenol but it's killing more people than vaccines could ever kill every year it's what's your how worried are folks in the medical community about this is it sort of a fringe I think it's something like we do have a poll of 20% of folks believe that there's a connection between MMR and in autism I mean how worried are folks in the medical community about this well we get pretty worried when we start seeing pockets of illness for example in Britain they have many outbreaks of since dr. or mr. Wakefield came out with his study and they have pockets of outbreaks of MMR and measles mumps and rubella are diseases that are very serious yeah measles can cause sub acute panic or subacute sclerosing pan encephalitis nobody wants that I don't know what that is but it sounds a fright act it sounds bad it is bad just like with the mumps you can get orchitis so you won't ever be able to have children if you're a man won't better produce children and rubella if you're not a GRU Belem you and your baby in utero get rubella and then they're stillborn so that's a very serious illness so we do not want people out there thinking oh my gosh I can't give me the MMR when this vaccine has never been proven to anything wrong to anyone now we have to say you know there are risks associated but the benefits of vaccination in this country far outweigh the risks for the particular patient that does get the vaccine and for the community at large dr. Cory thank you so much sir I really appreciate it thank you guys take good care and good luck we turn now to a new book about conspiracy theories and their role in American political story take a look at this
1,"Dyanne it's so exciting to meet you in the flesh I've been talking to you for four years now at least at least so actually the first time I saw your name was I had I had read the interview that Mercier minted with you in the Huffington Post yeah and time has elapsed since then was an amazing interview amazing interview I was blown away I don't want to repeat the interview but I want you to start off by telling me why you were being interviewed in the first place what is your role to the Gardasil vaccine what is your role with Merck what was your role and what and what have you what has it happened since then my role in the whole story of the HPV vaccines is not where I was at the bench I did not develop the VLP I did not torture mice where I came into the picture was once they had a potential vaccine that they thought would work in human beings I was then asked to be a part of the International group that worked with both Merck and with GSK to help design the clinical trials in humans that would show what are the appropriate endpoints that we need to look for and how do we need to look for them how often do we need to screen and how many years do we need to follow women in order to understand whether or not these vaccines would have any efficacy mm-hmm what were the endpoints that you would recommend it to look at and has that been done so we needed to have disease endpoints and we needed to make sure that women were examined so unlike most pediatric vaccine trials where they could give the vaccine and then just draw blood to check for an antibody response in this particular vaccine we had to know that it was actually changing the disease manifestation so what we did is say that we have to measure the HPV so we have to know which HPV type is being detected and then we have to know are there abnormal pap smears that are happening and if there are abnormal pap smears what is the level of histologic or tissue disease that we see and in the course of the trial if anyone develops cancer that would be a very important endpoint but the trial wasn't designed to detect whether the vaccines would ever prevent against cancer because we know that cancer is a rare rare event in the long-term progression of these of this HPV disease process so what you're saying is that the design was never meant to look at was it preventing cervical cancer it was just histological changes related to HPV but clearly the way that vaccine is marketed it's marketed everyone thinks that this is market that this is going to prevent cervical cancer so the question is why did the companies not use cervical cancer as the endpoint the companies know it would be very expensive for them to take the trials out long enough to be able to capture enough cancer endpoints and one would also argue that it would be unethical to let a woman develop cancer in a trial when we can prevent it so well with pap smear detection so that they talked with the FDA and they agreed on what is called a surrogate endpoint and the FDA agreed with the companies that if they could prove that the vaccines prevented the development of CIN 3 that they would allow the label to say that these can prevent cancer so it was a negotiated agreement with the FDA upfront about what endpoints had to be demonstrated by the trials in order for the FDA to allow them to create a label to then advertise to the public and there were enough women in the placebo group that developed CIN 3 relative to the group that received the vaccine that they felt it was enough of a claim for them to make absolutely both Gardasil and Cervarix showed that they had very close to a hundred percent efficacy in the vaccine arm and that indeed CIN 3 lesions developed in the placebo arm that were specifically caused by 16 and 18 which is that the targeted HPV types within the vaccine so out of curiosity were there HPV lesions that were not caused by 16 and 18 in the group that received the vaccine in the Gardasil trial yes there were there were several and if you looked at what is the action against CIN 3 due to any type of HPV we even though we know it's not in the vaccine you see that for Gardasil that protection is around 40% you see that for server X even though it only has two types in the actual vaccine that protection was 93 percent so it shows that server X has much more protection against HPV types that aren't even in the vaccine then does Gardasil that's interesting Wow you don't read that at all anywhere you don't see that difference advertised because Merck was the first to market and they were a year and a half ahead of GSK it truly is the marketing principle that one which is whoever gets to market first get over 90% of the market share and then people are anchored in what it is they purchase what it is they think about and it's very hard for them to change to something else if you look at the way they're designed so both Gardasil and server X have HPV 16 and 18 VLPs in them so they are specifically designed to protect against 16 and 18 and the efficacy trials showed that for both of these vaccines they were nearly a hundred percent effective at preventing cin three caused by 16 and 18 they're equal but now if you go back and say yeah but in the Gardasil trial I had women who were vaccinated with all three doses and who had a cin three lesion at the end of the trial what's going on well that CIN 3 lesion was caused by HPV 52 okay it's caused by a different type of HPV so we said let's look at the data differently let's look at the data and say let's take this endpoint of CIN 3 and say we don't care whether 16 causes it or 18 or 52 or 31 or any of those numbers we're gonna take any CIN 3 regardless of which type it is and see how effective are these vaccines and what we saw is that with Gardasil it could prevent against about 40% of the whole group of cin threes okay so even if you got Gardasil you could still get 60% of the cin threes if we looked at the server X data what you saw is that it protected against 93% of all cin 3's 93% that's almost twice the coverage that you get so it is much more valuable for its ability to protect against CIN 3 lesions but we don't hear about that can you explain to me what what you mean by CIN 3 so if you look at the cervix as tissue there's five levels of abnormalities the cervix can have one is normal which isn't really abnormal but it's normal the other one is cancer at the other end that's very bad between normal and cancer there are three levels of abnormality we call that CIN one CIN two and CIN 3 CIN 3 is as close to cancer as you can get without being cancer and still a hundred percent treatable and a hundred percent curable the CIN one we consider just an infection and that it will probably go away with no other problem so when we look at these trials we're really interested in this CIN 3 outcome CIN 2 was a little different because CIN 2 we don't really know which side it leans to we don't know which way it it swings so we're thinking now that in the United States that we're going to treat it as a pre cancer so you will also see reported CIN 2/3 as an outcome but CIN 3 is the really the one that we want to care about and do you know how long the protection from either of the vaccines lasts I mean so the study was what 18 months because it was fast-tracked and I know it wasn't many years but how long was it and how long do you do we have evidence for the theon Abati's last that there's protection from either of those vaccinations both Merck and GSK initially designed their clinical trials to follow women for four years so that you would have an opportunity to develop CIN 3 for most of the women if they were going to develop a CIN 3 Merck was the first one to do their trial and what they found is that within 18 months of enrollment they had enough people in the placebo arm who had already developed a CIN 3 that they could show statistical significance to say that Gardasil was protective they took that data at 18 months to the FDA now the FDA what started to make their decisions on it and said you need to give us follow-up data so they continued this study and the study went for a little more than three years at which point they concluded it stopped it and fully reported the data to the FDA but in that meantime the FDA had already made the fast-track decision that this vaccine was excellent and that it would have FDA approval Merck used the FDA approval as the reason for them stopping the trial they said that it was unethical to continue a trial where women were randomized to receive placebo and real thing when the real thing worked now of course GSK was doing their trial in Cervarix at the same time and it wasn't unethical for the trials to continue you just needed to inform women that there was a vaccine that had been FDA approved and if they wish to withdraw they could but the fact of absolutely stopping the trial without giving women an opportunity to continue in the trial was the decision that was made at the corporate level and do we know how long the antibodies last like how long is the protection three years is it five years is it ten years you hear it's for life so interestingly in this whole process of getting a vaccine approved there is a phase process there is phase one happens with only about eight people eight human being and that's to make sure that it's not going to kill people it's usually high risk it's phase one you make sure that it's not gonna cause any harm and then you move into a Phase two trial which is what we call proof of principle or can we really see an outcome and is it not going to cause harm that's are usually a smaller numbers those are usually somewhere in the hundreds to hundreds three hundreds of people depending on numbers and then you move to the phase three trial if the Phase two trial works and the phase three trial is usually intense thousands of women and the phase three trial has to be big and has to be robust in being able to show efficacy the phase three trial is what the FDA uses to make their assessment about whether the vaccine works or not the Phase two trials is what gives you a lot of information and that's where we have our duration of efficacy for Gardasil the Phase two trial lasted for five years and then was abruptly stopped and so we know that in that five-year time frame that those hundreds of women not thousands but hundreds of women continued to show protection against HPV 16 and 18 so we can say very firmly and solidly that Gardasil lasts at least five years there have been no publications on any further época see beyond that Merck has presented several abstracts at conferences but they have never published any data and those of us in the science world know that if it's not published it doesn't it's not real so we know that abstracted information is often inaccurate it's often an early report it's often something that may change when the full spectrum of data are reported or when you have reviewers asking questions about the way in which the data are being reported so what we can say about Gardasil is that for sure it's going to last at least five years we have these abstracts that have been reported showing it lasts for six years and beyond that we don't know we just don't know it's it's unknown that the information is out there the CDC will tell you we have no evidence that it's not effective and I would counter that we have no evidence that it is effective so we really need to just be clear about where we're basing our perspectives with server X again it's the Phase two trial with server X and for server X the data was followed for nine point four years eight point four years is published so if we're going to use that same metric then we have to say that Cervarix lasts for at least eight point four years it shows it has very high antibody titers and has done very well over that period of time I think an important piece of information to know is that for server X the National Cancer Institute is using that vaccine in their trial in Costa Rica and what they have found is that they have the same level of efficacy if you only get two doses and the same level of efficacy if you only get one dose so the cost of vaccinating people would be a third if you would go to server X for the one single dose and that it in the National Cancer Institute trials the NCI trials that again it lasts at least for four years who knows how much longer relative to what you know and what you've just told me compared to what we hear in the media it seems like there's a disconnect and so what what is your perception of what's being told in the to the public versus what's reality so the public needs a simple message but unfortunately that simple message was created by a for-profit company and the simple message was at the time it came out get Gardasil and your daughter will be one less meaning one last circle cancer victim well in reality she was never going to be a cervical cancer victim if she had gone on with her pap smears so the concept of using fear to sell vaccines was prominent and knew that it could get a reaction from the public about I want to protect my daughter I want to be a good parent now what was not ever said anywhere with how long the vaccine would last no one said there may be an issue with you may need booster shots later or it may only last for a certain amount of time it was completely unspoken so when people received the vaccine they thought they were getting something that would last them their entire life and truly there were many misconceptions there were misconceptions that this was a vaccine to cure all cancers and that is a total misperception this has nothing to do with all cancers this has to do with very specific HPV 1618 related cervical cancers the other mistake that people took away from this message was I never have to have another pap smear again because I'm not going to ever have anything wrong with my cervix if I get this vaccine well that's wrong that is very wrong and in fact I think that has hurt women's health more than any other health message has ever happened we have now the first study published from the UK from the UK national HPV immunization program that shows us that of women of screening age right now who were vaccinated at the time when the vaccine programs were happening that of those who received vaccines and are now 21 years and older of screening age that only 26% of those women went to get their pap smears done 26% that is very very low we need to have screening rates above 80% or women are not going to have anything that's wrong detected now the second telling point from that study was that of those women who were vaccinated and did go get screened 14 to 15 percent of them had abnormal screens so you still get abnormal pap smears after vaccination and we know that from the studies but that was never publicly acknowledged or publicly stated the message that you heard was get your HPV vaccine it was not get your HPV vaccine and make sure you continue your PAP screening now there I have read some cases of girls who've received the vaccine who actually went on to developed to develop cervical cancer and precancerous lesions I think in Norway there was a post surveillance study that was published you know anything about this and the second part of this is that I've been told that mercs position on this is that if you are HPV naive when you receive the vaccine that that mate potentiate the HPV strain itself do you know can you speak to this at all I don't know the exact study what I can offer is that if you already are infected with HPV 16 or 18 before you get Gardasil but you don't have any detectable 16 or 18 on your pap smears and you get the Gardasil that 16 or 18 can still develop in the normal course and go into a CIN lesion the vaccine will not prevent that from happening it won't speed it up either and it won't make it worse but it's immaterial it doesn't matter that you've got the vaccine when you already had the infection it's so what that says is that you could have a 16 or 18 infection get Gardasil and then go on and develop a CIN 3 or potentially even a cancer if you weren't detected because that vaccine wasn't given at a time when it could prevent that okay adverse events I want to talk to you about the adverse events because I want to talk about the placebo there's been a lot written about the placebo used in the Phase two and three trials phase one I understand was saline injection but phase two and three was the aluminum adjuvant and it it's been well I've seen research on this aluminum adjuvant specifically showing that there's a lot of potential for neurotoxicity and adverse neurological events as well as adverse autoimmune events so I'm wondering was this known at the time the vaccine was being created did were there other researchers aware of this what is it thinking now in terms of well what's your opinion now that you've you're not you're no longer involved and we see these studies coming to light so again let's go back to what the FDA and Merck agreed upon and negotiated at the time that they were having their discussions about what would the FDA give them for a label and whether or not they would say it was safe and efficacious and what Merck said is that we know that no antigen meaning the material that's actually directed to the disease you're interested in that no antigen is ever going to last long enough to really prevent disease so we always have to have this adjuvant or this helper that allows that antigen to stay around longer so that the body can continue to make antibody responses to it and continue to be able to fight off new disease if you didn't have that adjuvant then you would never have efficacy so the FDA agreed that the comparison groups would be the antigens plus adjuvant versus the adjuvant alone and that was to see whether these antigen particles would actually create an antibody response to move forward so in the negotiation process the safety of the adjuvant was not a consideration there's lots of information that's coming out now worried about aluminum worried about aluminum with dementia worried about aluminum toxicities and I think that it is incredibly important that we continue to fund science to understand what are these long-term events there isn't an adverse event that happens in every single person that gets it so it's not something common but it is something that is happening in several people and understanding what are the scientific linkages and what are the scientific reasons for that is important and needs to be studied Merck was able to use this proprietary aluminum adjuvant because they had used it in other vaccines and they had had FDA approval for that aluminum adjuvant which had been used in many of their other pediatric vaccines to be used in this vaccine again I'd love your opinion on this there is a lot of information coming forward a lot of families are saying that their children their daughters have been in seriously damaged permanently damaged in some cases death from the vaccine itself and many people in the industry say that the these sudden deaths and these weird autoimmune neurological responses are coincidences and I'm curious what you think about that so I am a physician and I take care of people I am also a researcher and do public health research there is a difference between public health what is good for the majority of people versus what I as a physician am going to counsel or guide an individual person in their particular health choices and I think it's necessary for us to make those two distinctions as what hat are you wearing at this time if I wear my public health hat the World Health Organization as well as the CDC has classified adverse events into many categories but there's one category called very rare and very rare means it happens less than 1 in 10,000 if it happens at a rate of less than 1 in 10,000 they can't prove it and they can't disprove it so it is so rare from a public health standpoint it is so rare that it's inconsequential one in 10,000 does sound rare maybe but if you multiply that by hundreds of millions of women you may get a larger number of people who have real problems with having had the vaccine it's in a very grey zone and if a woman or a young girl has a reaction and it's happened after Gardasil you have to take care of the woman you have to as in my opinion as a physician you have to take care of each woman individually or again girl and you have to provide the appropriate counseling which is you must continue PAP screening and if you would like to consider protection against HPV we have two possible vaccines you could choose from again it's something additional there are there are reports a very rare side effects that may happen pap smears are uncomfortable but they don't have side effects it is incredibly important for us as physicians to make sure that a mother and a daughter or if it's a young woman is appropriately educated that she has to continue PAP screening before she even gets the shot you have to say to her you have to come back for cervical cancer screening and when you're 21 years and if you want the vaccine you can I tell my patients it's like socks and shoes okay you're going to protect your feet if you're wearing shoes but you may protect your feet more if you wear socks and shoes if you don't wear socks you may get blisters and that's a bad effect if you only wear socks you may get bad things happen to your feet because you don't have your shoes on so pap smears are your shoes you have to have your shoes and whether or not you HPV vaccines as whether or not you want to wear socks rape 8 if we're talking about 1 in 10,000 that's not extremely rare you know how many what's the rate of American women getting cervical cancer is it less than 1 a 10,000 are more than 1 in 10,000 the incidence rate in the United States of women developing cervical cancer who have been through a pap smear screening program right now on average is 7 per hundred thousand women so it's smaller than the one in 10,000 right and so if for conversational purposes if we could say that these reactions these are very serious adverse reactions are 1 in 10,000 it you know and again the risk of getting cervical cancer is much lower than that how can we what's the risk benefit ratio of this facts I mean you're comparing it to socks which you know to me may or may not be a fair comparison I mean socks prevent blisters we don't know that the vaccine will really prevent anything for the individual we do know that the risk we think the risk if you look at the reporting for an adverse event could be could be a greater risk than their risk of actually getting cervical cancer if they didn't get the vaccine so you know that's what I'm trying to figure out the risk benefit ratio here that is why it's very important for a physician to have an individual conversation with each woman that is an individual decision that each woman needs to make and she needs to understand what is her risk tolerance from your question your risk tolerance is that is too high and you would not take it and many of my patients say that many of my patients say I'll take it i want the vaccine i want the protection i'm not worried about it you know it's you know do you play the lottery or don't you play the lottery you know it's the opposite you if you win the lottery you're happy if you you know you win the the adverse event lottery you're not happy that's a bad thing to happen I think that we have to go back to the construct of the way the United States was put together which is that businesses are in business to make money and they're in business to sell their product and they will sell their product to people for higher prices if they can get those prices so that they can sell their product to people who don't have as much money for lesser prices so that in the end they make money they're a for-profit company there they are beholden to their shareholders they don't have a physician-patient relationship they don't have a relationship with wh o or CDC they are responsible to their shareholders on the other hand we have to remember that companies have been very successful with creating infant vaccines which have saved many children's lives we've been especially in developing countries they've been exported from developed countries into developing countries mostly through philanthropic organizations to be able to keep these kids alive so we can give them life expense so the concept of a vaccine is a good concept in general but what links it is that the company is there to make money and they have to sell it to industrialized countries in order to be able to subsidize the lower price that they provide it for in developing countries now that could be viewed good or that could be viewed bad but the point is that it is a for-profit company that is responsible to their shareholders and their job is to sell as much vaccine as they can for the biggest price they can get this is why the discussion about HPV vaccines is not a simple discussion it's not a discussion of oh here you're 11 years old you need a shot in your arm it is a discussion that needs to evolve it needs to be physician to individual it needs to be one-on-one it needs to be asking the patient or the patient's mother if the patient is too young to participate in the decision about what their risk threshold is what they value if that is too high that is obviously too high for you and as your physician if I were your physician I would say iris that Tony that is your decision and you understand that you can get cervical cancer prevention from PAP screening and that you must continue to do if I had other patients that have come in and have said you know that risk factor doesn't worry me at all I am okay with that and I want the extra protection I may never get an HPV infection in my life where my HPV infection may go away all by itself but I want that extra reassurance then that person has made an individual decision that that risk isn't so much for them and I respect that as a physician that they want it that's that's I've told them they we've been able to discuss it and they're okay with that again I will tell them this is does not replace your pap smear you still have to come in for your cervical cancer screening that is incredibly important so that's not the conversation happening in the country the conversation that is happening is the thing is what you had said initially at the start of this which is you're 11 you need your Gardasil vaccine that's the conversation that's happening in doctors offices today that conversation makes me very sad because the usually it's the pediatricians who are doing the vaccination and the pediatricians are not seeing the disease of cin 3 or the disease of abnormal pap smears that young women then have to go through colposcopy go through biopsies go through worry go through screening every six months to see whether they are quote-unquote clearing the virus that is very sad for me to see that that is the way in which this is being rolled out in the United States as I have said earlier we had now have firm evidence it's not just a gut feeling but we now have firm evidence that women who have been screened both in the Australian screening program and in the UK screening program that those in both of those countries where HPV vaccination has been highly pushed in school-based programs that the percentage of young women who show up for screening is lower than 50% and of those who are actually vaccinated it's even lower than that and that is not acceptable for women's health and you said that those that have been vaccinated still had a 15% rate of abnormal pap smears that's correct so and and we know that from the studies we know that both Gardasil and cervix will reduce the abnormal pap smears by about 20% okay so that means there's a significant portion of abnormal pap smears that are still happening what and that is important because those women will still have abnormal pap smears one of the worst messages that could come forward from this vaccination messaging without saying pap smears are there is that those women who get vaccinated and get screened and say I still had an abnormal pap smear who's telling me the truth and that's when the the trust in the public health system or the trust between the patient and their physician starts to fall apart so there's studies there's post surveillance studies looking at women or girls who received the vaccine to see how many come in for follow-up pap smears for screening how many partake in the screening program and how many of those that do partake in the screening program are positive with abnormal pap smears so the studies exist in the UK and in Australia do we have a study here in the United States the United States does not have a vaccine registry they don't have any Copas copy registries we don't have any registry in which we can look at large numbers of women to determine what is the follow up of these women over time the places that are most likely to be able to provide us with this answer are places like Kaiser or places that are very large HMOs that have a population who stayed with them but I think what we've also seen in health economic studies in the United States is that most people are with their provider for about three years before their health insurance changes and then they're forced to go to a different provider and so being able to link that data long-term just is not the way the United States databases are set up so we will have this kind of information in the United States but we'll have it in small groups we'll have it in groups of maybe a hundred 200 maybe a thousand depending on who's going to look at the study but we will never have the large numbers that they have in the UK and in Australia that have very early and very clearly shown us that women are choosing not to get pap smears whether they're vaccinated or not this whole message has made them not afraid of any kind of cancer or not wanting to participate in something that's preventive and good for their health to look at it on the positive side and that as you've said the women who do are get vaccinated and who do present to screening continue to have abnormal paps so we worry about all of those who aren't coming in for screening and what are their abnormal paps and what kind of lesions are they developing the time merck presented the initial studies to the fda it was said that there was no HPV DNA in the vaccine a few years ago HPV DNA was in fact proven to be present in every vaccines every lot of vaccine studied and merck then changed their verbiage my question to you as a researcher who understands DNA and understands things that trigger cancers are you concerned about HPV DNA existing in the vaccine knowing that it's being injected into young girls and boys would I be concerned about that as a source of HPV infection for say had a net cancer or say another kind of cancer and the answer is probably not because the way HPV has to infect is that it has to be a skin-to-skin contact it's not spread through the blood or through lymphatics to be infectious so probably as a means of infection that would be inadvertently giving you the infection it was trying to prevent I'm probably not so concerned but there's the whole other side of it about what are good manufacturing processes and what kinds of particulate matter if that's DNA or if it's left over from the e.coli that it is actually manufactured in what kind of damage or what kind of effect do those particulates have on the body that's completely separate from the vaccine itself and I think that that's an area of X and ology and that's an area of study that we haven't looked at very closely do we know that injecting HPV DNA in the bloodstream directly is safe I mean how where is evidence that that I understand how in the natural environment HPV is skin-to-skin I understand that but do we have any evidence to show that injecting HPV DNA into somebody's bloodstream is safe no that's an honest answer it's the truth when you did you leave Merck I mean I was under the impression that you kind of left Merck because you did not like the way they were marketing the vaccine is that true I never have worked for Merck I have always been an independent scientist when I was doing my trials and when I was asked to help them design the clinical trials I was a professor at Dartmouth Medical School and did some we were a clinical site and did some of the trials in New Hampshire with the population in"

0,".  Vaccinations are incredibly important in fighting disease.  But a growing group of people seem to believe  that vaccinations endanger our health.  A lot of negative consequences of vaccination such as allergies,  Disabilities and even deaths have been reported.  And it's true, vaccination can have side effects.  How do vaccinations work and how dangerous are they really?  * Intro *  Your immune system is a complex army of billions of cells:  Soldiers, information stores and arms factories.  Every day you are attacked countless times  but your immune soldiers usually take care of it independently,  so that you don't even notice  If there is a serious infection,  collect the information cells  Know about the attacker and activate our weapons factory.  You know the weapons: antibodies.  They're like guided missiles that were built  to fight a specific attacker.  Unfortunately, this process takes several days.  This gives the attacker enough time to cause damage.  Contrary to popular belief:  What doesn't kill you doesn't make you stronger either.  Our body wants dangerous battles  not unsubscribe over and over again.  So our immune system has developed a tactic  to get stronger over time.  When we fight an enemy strong enough  to activate our heavy weapons,  then the immune system automatically creates memory cells.  They remain dormant in our body for years.  Your job is only to remember.  When an enemy attacks a second time,  awaken the slumbering cells,  coordinate attacks and order the production of antibodies,  and that in the shortest possible time.  This is so quick and effective that many pathogens  once defeated, never make you sick again.  We may even be immune forever.  That is why, for example, small children are constantly sick.  You haven't built enough memory cells yet.  And this great, natural mechanism  we build up when we vaccinate.  As great as memory cells are to get them through an infection,  is uncomfortable and potentially dangerous.  Vaccines trick our bodies into  Build memory cells and become immune to disease:  They pretend to be a dangerous infection.  You can, for example, inject harmless pathogens.  They are made harmless by killing or dismembering them.  Our immune system can cope with such vaccinations fairly easily.  Sometimes you have to challenge the immune system even more,  so that it produces even more memory cells.  You can only do that with live vaccines.  A defensive enemy  is namely a bigger challenge than a dead one.  But that sounds like a terrible idea.  What if the pathogen wins?  To prevent that,  let's breed a weak cousin of the real pathogen in the laboratory.  One who is just powerful enough  to annoy the immune system and create memory cells.  So this is the basic principle of vaccination.  They provoke a natural reaction in our body,  that makes us immune to dangerous diseases.  Some pathogens, like the flu virus, mutate so often  that we need a new vaccine every year.  But most vaccinations protect us for years or even a lifetime.  But wait a minute.  Like everything in life  Vaccinations also have a downside: side effects.  What are they and what happens when your child is affected?  It is difficult to understand the side effects of vaccinations  to compare directly with the effects of the diseases.  For example, there are hundreds of millions of people in the west  vaccinated against measles.  But there were only 83,000 measles cases in Europe in 2018.  With numbers so different  even minor side effects are frightening,  when compared to the consequences of an illness,  that we don't even know anymore.  Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963,  practically every child in the world has  at some point infected with measles.  In the 1950s that still corresponded to approx. 135 million cases,  every year.  But is measles really that dangerous in 2019?  We're medical  and so technologically advanced.  Should you risk the side effects of a vaccination for this?  How about a thought experiment  based on real numbers.  In an industrial nation  in a parallel universe with good medical care,  the vaccination has been stopped.  Let's assume,  that 10,000,000 children there are infected with measles.  What is happening?  9,800,000, or 98%, get a high fever  and an uncomfortable rash.  Up to 800,000 of them, or 8%, suffer from dangerous diarrhea.  700,000 or 7% get an otitis media,  which can lead to permanent hearing loss.  600,000 children or 6% get pneumonia  the most dangerous side effect of measles.  She alone will kill 12,000 children.  Up to 10,000 children, or 0.1%, develop encephalitis.  2,500 children, 0.025%, become infected with SSPE, a disease  where the measles virus remains in the children's brains  and kills her a few years later.  In total, there will be around 2.5 million children  suffer from the more severe effects of measles.  About 20,000 children will die of measles.  But that's not all.  The children who survive have severely damaged immune systems,  that takes a long time to recover.  This makes you more susceptible to other diseases.  Apart from this,  These children are almost certainly doing  really bad for two weeks.  Okay, but what about vaccinations?  It's only fair to watch the aftermath here too.  So back to our thought experiment  but now we are vaccinating 10,000,000 children with the MMR vaccine.  What's happening now?  After they are vaccinated,  of our 10,000,000 children get about 10% fever.  500,000, 5%, get a slight rash.  At up to 100 or 0.001%  there may be a serious allergic reaction,  that needs to be treated.  Up to 10 boys, or 0.0001%, can get genital inflammation.  And with up to 10 children or 0.0001%  The worst side effect can occur: encephalitis.  So if we vaccinate 10,000,000 children  then a total of 120 of them have more severe side effects.  Thanks to good medical care in industrialized countries  almost all of them will survive well.  And autism?  The link between autism and vaccinations  comes from a single source that has been refuted many times since then.  You can find literature references and videos in the video description.  In 2019, however, it is definitely clear: vaccination does not cause autism.  And what about deaths?  Indeed, it is very difficult to tell if even a single one  of our 10 million vaccinated children would die.  We did a lot of research on this and talked to many experts.  If you ignore self-assessments,  then we could only have a small handful  of documented deaths,  and that with hundreds of millions of children  who have received the MMR vaccination since 1971.  Measles is many, many thousands of times more dangerous to our children  as the absolute worst case of vaccination side effects.  You have to use a huge magnifying glass  look for deadly side effects of vaccinations,  and even then it is difficult to find confirmed cases.  While measles deaths are very real and very easy to find.  In 2017 alone 110,000 people died of measles worldwide.  Statistically, 300 children die of measles today,  one since this video started.  Vaccinations can be compared to seat belts.  Are there any tragic accidents in which someone is killed by their seat belt?  Yes, yes.  But do you think that's why it would be safer  Children not buckling up?  But wait, what if your child is actually allergic?  What if our facts  does not apply to your specific situation?  Then you should become the biggest vaccination advocate of all.  Because if you can't get your child vaccinated  only the community can protect it.  This is called herd immunity and it's the only protection  that your unvaccinated child has.  Herd immunity means that so many people are immune  are against a disease that the pathogen cannot spread,  but dies before he can reach his victims.  But to do that with measles,  95% of all people around you must be vaccinated.  The problem with the vaccination debate is  that it will not be fair.  While the vaccination advocates  argue with studies and statistics,  the counter-arguments are usually a wild mixture of gut feeling,  Anecdotes and misinformation.  And feelings are often immune to facts.  We won't convince anyone  by shouting down his misgivings  but we can't hide from  what such conspiracy theories do:  They kill babies too young to be vaccinated.  They kill healthy children who are just unlucky.  They bring serious diseases back from the brink of extinction.  The biggest side effect of vaccinations is a reduction in the number of dead children.  Vaccinations are one of our most powerful weapons  fighting monsters that many of us have already forgotten.  Let us see to it that these monsters do not return.  Subtitle: ARD Text on behalf of Funk (2019)"
-1,"welcome back to Mayo Clinic radio I'm dr. Tom shives and I'm Traci McCray a measles outbreak centered around Portland Oregon and neighboring Vancouver Washington has sickened more than 50 people most of them children 47 of those infected were never vaccinated against measles there have also been measles outbreaks in New York and Texas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children receive measles vaccinations in early childhood and while most children in the u.s. do get the recommended vaccinations to protect them against infectious diseases such as measles and mumps recent CDC data have found that a small but growing percentage of young very young children aren't getting their shots in fact the rates of unvaccinated toddlers appears to have quadrupled in the past 17 years for all of us and especially infectious disease specialists the skepticism regarding vaccines is of huge concern so joining us in studio to talk about vaccine for kids and to give us an update on the flu season as well is Mayo Clinic infectious disease specialist dr. new pune Rajapaksa welcome back to the program dr. Rajapaksa thanks to you again thanks it's great to be back good to have you here dr. Rajapaksa so it's pretty common knowledge now that the children in the Northeast and other parts of the United States who have gotten measles were not vaccinated yeah so with this current outbreak and what we see in most of these outbreaks that happen sporadically across the United States is that a vast majority of those who become ill are people who have not received the recommended measles mumps rubella vaccine occasionally there are some cases in people who received a single dose we know a single dose of MMR vaccine is about 93 percent effective two doses are upwards of 97% effective but by far the majority have not received the recommended routine vaccines for those mumps and rubella and the increasing resistance to vaccine is being guided a little bit a lot maybe by social media yeah so we see a lot of information on social media regarding vaccines obviously some Pro vaccine and some anti vaccine but a lot of people are now getting their health news there medical advice there scientific news through social media and so as a medical community we really have a responsibility to make sure that it's accurate information that people are getting the interesting thing about social media is kind of what you see is also reflective of the kind of engagement that you have with posts and so if you have already anti-vaccine kind of slant you will be presented with information that kind of confirms your views and so that's one of the big concerns and it's been quite interesting in the last few months to see some of these big social media groups kind of recognizing this as an issue and starting to take some steps in the right direction where's this misinformation coming from do we know so the misinformation comes from a variety of sources kind of dating back to the article by Andrew Wakefield in the late 90s which many people still kind of bring up as a reason that they are hesitant about vaccinating their children we know that since that article on MMR vaccine and autism came out we have had numerous numerous scientific studies that were well done that have shown absolutely no link between the two including a large one that was just released last week the largest study in a Danish population over 600,000 children that again confirmed what we we knew before which was that there was absolutely no link between MMR vaccine and autism but those types of pieces of information have a way of kind of working their way into the psyche and there are people who have profited from kind of spreading that information including celebrities and other people who have gained a following for their views and so that can be very difficult to kind of change what's your reaction to this read recently that despite the measles outbreaks and across the country at least 20 states have introduced bills this year that would broaden the reasons why parents can exempt kids from getting vaccines yeah so that is just staggering and very disappointing I think as an infectious disease specialist we know that these infections are preventable and that's really taking a step in the exact wrong direction there are states that allow philosophical and religion exemptions for vaccines and to try and expand those even beyond that really exposes our our kids to these life-threatening serious illnesses for really no reason at all and so it's very concerning to us thankfully many of these won't get passed but the fact that they're even out there are being proposed is really a huge concern I don't even know if I want to ask about the Russians is there anything to the fact that that's part of the misinformation piece so there have been some articles that have come out recently suggesting that some of the misinformation is being spread or amplified kind of by bots and all these things that can post things on social media so I think it's definitely a possibility and really it's not doing anything to to help get good information to parents who are trying to make these decisions are there some children for medical reasons that should not get vaccinated yes so there are some legitimate medical reasons why some kids should not receive vaccines these are primarily centered around the live vaccines so that's your measles mumps rubella vaccine and your varicella or chickenpox vaccine children who have weakened immune systems whether they've had an organ transplant are receiving chemotherapy things like that those children would not be eligible to receive those vaccines because they are kind of live weakened versions of those viruses let's talk about some measles myths one of them being that antibiotics will help you so don't get the shot but then just get antibiotics if you get if you do get measles so that's a complete myth there is no antibiotic or antiviral that works against measles the only care that we're able to offer for that is what we call supportive care or dealing with the symptoms that the child may have and we know that there are serious life-threatening complications that can develop from a measles infection about one in a thousand kids with measles will develop encephalitis or brain swelling that can leave them with lasting effects or death and one to two and a thousand can die from the infection itself and so very serious complications that are just completely unnecessary in this area era where we have something we can do to prevent these more myths more myths I guess are that measles is not that contagious it is in fact one of the most contagious infectious diseases the virus particles can remain suspended in the air for up to two hours after someone with measles has left and so you never even need to come face-to-face with someone with measles to contract it and if exposed ninety percent of people who are unvaccinated will develop infection and so that's why it is such a difficult infection to control once it has taken hold in a community that does not have immunity to it we promised our audience would ask you about the flu season it's peeked so we this has been an unusual year for flu so what we're seeing this year is an initial wave of h1n1 which seems to have peaked in the northern hemisphere what we're now seeing kind of on the tail of that peak in some areas especially in the south was a second wave of h3n2 typically we see one or the other in each season this year we're seeing some early indications that we might actually have both in one season which is unusual and so we're waiting to see kind of what happens in this area in the north in Minnesota but it's been a bit of a typical year so far in other areas of the country treatment if your child gets the flu anything special you should do so there are there's an antiviral available for treatment of flu called oseltamivir not everyone requires treatment we required we recommend treatment for people who are at high risk of developing complications that would be definitely children under two years of age children under five years of age may have a higher risk of complications as well pregnant women people with compromised immune systems or weakened immune systems the elderly or people who have underlying hard lung or neurologic diseases the otherwise kind of average healthy person with the flu will probably recover on their own and in that situation we recommend kind of symptomatic treatment so tylenol ibuprofen lots of fluids and tough it out so how long are you contagious when can you go back to work or school so people with the flu are usually contagious for about a day before they even themselves have symptoms and generally lasting for up to a week after onset of symptoms young children or people with weakened immune systems may actually be able to transmit for longer than that all right infectious disease specialist dr. new Pune Rajapaksa there is no question in your mind or ours that vaccines prevent serious diseases and deaths it is truly unfortunate that based on non-scientific information some parents are choosing not to have their children vaccinated measles for example as you've mentioned can be a serious disease can even be fatal thanks for joining us dr. Rajapaksa thanks for having me"
-1,">> Hi, my name's Paul Offit. I'm talking to
 you today from the Vaccine Education Center here at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
 Probably the most common question that we get asked in our Center, ""Is it OK to delay,
 or withhold, or separate, or space out vaccines?"" Or said in other ways, ""Is it OK to use kind
 of an alternative vaccine schedule?"" One where children aren't vaccinated with as many vaccines
 in the first couple years of life. The answer to that question is no, it's not
 OK to do that for a couple of reasons. One, there has been extensive testing using so-called
 concomitant use studies showing that when a new vaccine is added to the schedule that
 it doesn't interfere with the immunogenicity profile, or the safety profile of existing
 vaccines, and vice versa — that existing vaccines don't interfere with the safety profile
 or the immunogenicity profile of existing vaccines. So the schedule as it's currently recommended
 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics is
 well tested. To make up another schedule is to essentially use an untested schedule. Secondly, there is no advantage to delaying
 vaccines. All that does is increase the period of time during which children are susceptible
 to these viral or bacterial infections with no benefits. Although it may feel better,
 I think more for the parent than the child, to delay vaccines, it really doesn't help
 the child. I think the third point is, and parents could
 reasonably argue, that when you get four or five shots at once, that that's far more stress
 provoking than say if a child got one or two shots. That's actually been studied. The way
 the physiologist measure stress is looking at cortisol secretion by the adrenal glands
 as a measure of stress if you will. And you're actually no more stressed out when you get
 multiple vaccines than when you get a single vaccine. Which is to say you're pretty much
 maximally stressed out as one shot, just after one shot. So to bring a child back more frequently,
 or even worse, to sort of delay vaccines until they're older, is only, frankly, to increase
 the stress associated with vaccination. So there is no benefit to delaying, or separating,
 or spacing out, or withholding vaccines. Children are best served by giving them a schedule
 as recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Hope that helps, thanks."
0,I think it's important talk about these things Jessica Biel is speaking out clarifying her stance on vaccinations for children after Robert F Kennedy revealed he and Jessica teamed up to speak out against a proposed California bill that would limit medical exemptions from vaccinations which got Jessica labeled an anti-vaxxer there's so much shame and guilt wrapped around you know motherhood and and and birth and what it means and how you do it and what your choices are the actress shared this lengthy pose to Instagram which in part says quote I am NOT against vaccinations I support children getting vaccinations and I also support families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians she says her friends have a child with a medical condition that warns an exemption from vaccinations and if the bill passes it would affect their ability to care for their child she then encouraged her followers to read more on the issue Jessica and hubby Justin Timberlake are parents to four year old Silas I think we are also both in awe of each other in moments and many many moments I will do something and feel that it's a bit of a mom fail and kind of look over at him and you know there's no judgment there so it's it's a very it's a safe place I think that we've we've created for ourselves and for our partnership
0,when Edward Jenner created the very first vaccine did he have any idea that it would become such a controversial issue all over the world well he couldn't have imagined that it would get this much attention that's for sure Twitter and Facebook have helped bring a lot of attention to the great controversies surrounding vaccinations mainly due to some celebrities being very vocal about the topic we prepared a list of celebs who are anti-vaxxers for several reasons find out what happened with Jenny McCarthy's son how did Jim Carrey disappoint some of his fans and what Mayim Bialik who has a real PhD thinks of vaccinations and before we start we share new and exciting celebrity videos every weekday so be sure to subscribe to our Channel and ring the bell to get notified about our latest videos Jenna Elfman Jenna Elfman is best known for her leading role in the ABC sitcom Dharma and Greg you may recognize her from her recent roles on growing up Fisher an AMC horror drama fear the walking dead the actress is now 46 and raising two kids in 2015 she spoke up on Facebook about the controversial vaccination issue for those who have missed the legislative scandal here's a small recap the senator of California signed the bill into the law in 2015 and it removes personal belief exemptions to vaccination requirements for entry to schools the co-authors of the bill even received death threats Jenna Elfman turns out to be among those who are outraged by the law on her Facebook page she states there is no health crisis unless they care to create one wait for it and frankly I'm astounded that we have to fight so hard for our parental rights as Americans in America but the thing is the issue of vaccinations came to the surface after a horrible outbreak of measles at Disneyland in 2014 which prompted the law to pass so even if Jenna Elfman was trying to emphasize the importance of human rights posting I'm not against vaccinations I am against the state removing parental rights our freedom to choose when how to vaccinate is AI MPT it made her look as if she's a member of the anti vaccine camp Elfman is also a member of Scientology a church that is well known for its anti-drug position perhaps that had some influence on her statement too Jenny McCarthy in fact the tension around vaccinations started long before that one of the most famous cases with celebrities and vaccination controversies happened with Jenny McCarthy Jenny started her career as a nude model for Playboy but you probably remember her best as a co-host of the talk show the view she has been married twice and dated actor Jim Carrey for five years in-between her only son Evan was born in 2002 and was diagnosed with autism three years later McCarthy believed that the vaccinations her son received at an early age caused the disorder even though she denies she is anti vaccine she became quite vocal about it and got described by The Daily Beast as the nation's most prominent purveyor of anti-vaxxer ideology I don't think it was just the MMR shot that caused any kind of trigger with autism I think it was a compilation of so many shots to a kid that obviously had some autoimmune disorders says Jenny but a couple of years later when her son seizures were treated the doctors realized Evan had a disease often mistaken for autism nevertheless Jenny denied any mistake in the diagnosis and was sure she cured her son with some non-traditional medicine including hyperbaric oxygen chambers spoons rubbed on his body a gluten-free and casseon free diet and chelation try everything she advises parents Jenny even published her own books on treating autism regardless of the lack of decent scientific proof of the connection between MMR shots and autism in 2008 she received the James Randi Educational Foundation Spig Asus award for her contribution to the pseudoscience as a performer who has fooled the greatest number of people with the least amount of effort ouch probably not the kind of award she was dreaming of on his website James Randi wrote that he sympathizes with McCarthy and her son but reproached her for using her public status to discourage so many people from vaccinating their own kids in 2015 a physiatrist criticized McCarthy in a Medscape article saying she has no idea what she is talking about what she said is misleading and harmful and the measles outbreak is a clear indication of the response to the spread of such pseudo scientific myths why do you tend to believe more in this question let us know in the comments section below Jim Carrey Jim Carrey is the King of Comedy who has starred in masterpiece movies including the mask Bruce Almighty the Ace Ventura series and so many others that we would be counting till tomorrow he managed to use a bit of his humor in his sketches dissing Trump and also on stage when making jokes about Shia LaBeouf but Jim left his sense of humor behind when it came to vaccination and seriously took a hard stance on it his point of view on the question probably got influenced by his ex-girlfriend Jenny McCarthy on his Twitter Jim wrote they say mercury and fish is dangerous but forcing all of our children to be injected with mercury in thimerosal as no-risk makes sense it triggered a huge discussion it even resulted in people making jokes about the couple by referring to his movie Dumb and Dumber yikes he also added I repeat I am Pro vaccinations anti neurotoxin as is Robert Kennedy jr. posting a link on an article and book supporting his idea Robert De Niro Robert De Niro is a legend best known for his roles on taxi driver Raging Bull and The Godfather Part 2 and now for this De Niro was very impressed by the movie vexed from cover-up to catastrophe a documentary that describes all the supposed problems caused by childhood vaccinations I think the movie is something that people should see De Niro explained there is a lot of information about things that are happening with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the pharmaceutical companies there's a lot of things that are not said I as a parent of a child who has autism I'm concerned I want to know the truth Cindy Crawford the world-famous supermodel Cindy Crawford also promoted one more anti vaccine movie trace amounts on her Twitter a film showing the alleged connection between mercury in vaccine and autism Alicia Silverstone Alicia became a huge star in the late 90s after the movie clueless got on screen now it turns out she's one more member of the anti-vaccine campaign Alicia does not oppose the government regulations it just looks like vaccinations does not fit into her vegan and well-being philosophy in her own parenting book the kind mama which is anti vaccine and anti diaper she wrote according to doctors Roizen and oz while there has not been a conclusive study of the negative effects of such a rigorous one-size-fits-all shoot-'em-up schedule there is increasing anecdotal evidence from doctors who have gotten distressed phone calls from parents claiming their child was never the same after receiving a vaccine and I personally have friends whose babies were drastically affected in this way Charlie Sheen we're not sure if he is best known for his role on Two and a Half Men or for his cocaine and women abuse charges he has two little daughters with his former wife Denise Richards the ex couple had such a big argument on vaccinating their kids that they took it to court when Denise who supports vaccination won the battle charlie allegedly attacked the doctor in retaliation we're not sure if that's true but Sheen definitely opposed the idea of vaccination Donald Trump before Donald Trump became the president he joined the camp of anti-vaxxers back in 2014 he claims vaccination is unsafe of which there's no decent scientific proof but he also said he would fix it once he becomes president on his Twitter he wrote if I were president I would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take autism and yet we haven't heard much about his progress on this matter Danny Masterson do you still remember that 70 show with Aston Kutcher and Mila Kunis if you do then you'll definitely remember Danny Masterson Danny compared the California vaccination law to the Nazi methods of governing tweeting hi friends help me fight California fascism and sign this petition no one tells us how to live am i right perhaps it's also worth mentioning that Danny is a Scientologist among other Scientologists who are vocal about the anti vaccination bill is Kirstie Alley coincidence or not but the beloved leader of the kids from the movie it takes to me and my shadow took her rage to Twitter saying no on SP 277 nonono protect your rights to choose the vaccines your kids and you have they are not all harmless your kids your choice Mayim Bialik Mayim Bialik who plays Amy the neuroscientists and white to Sheldon Cooper in the Big Bang Theory series it's an incredible coincidence that she actually has a real-life PhD in neuroscience the actress describes her family as a non vaccinating family in an early interview in 2009 for People magazine Bialik said we are non vaccinating families but I make no claims about people's individual decisions we based ours on research and discussions with our pediatrician and we've been happy with that decision but obviously there's a lot of controversy about it but six years is a long time and it turns out the actress actually changed her mind regarding vaccinations Bialik is a role model to many liberal Jewish parents thousands of people following her example of parenting in fact Hollywood rabbi Jeffrey Salkin stated in his interview to religious news service the Talmud says Jewish parents are obligated to teach their children three things Torah a trade and how to swim swimming is a metaphor parents need to teach their children how to avoid dangerous situations like for example infectious diseases perhaps that's what also influenced Bialik's change of mind so maíam had to clarify her position and refute the rumors the actress said I would like to dispel the rumors about my stance on vaccines I am NOT anti vaccine my children are vaccinated there has been so much hysteria and anger about issue and I hope this clears things up as far as my part she continued her post referring to her past statements and explaining that she is just trying to do what is best for her children let us know what you think of celebrities ideas on vaccinations in the comments below thanks for watching subscribe to our channel to not miss a story about your favorite celebrities
1,so you really want to vaccinate your kid you're taking a huge gamble look at the ingredients before you do anything that alone is enough to wait most people up could I know 18 years ago what I know today things would have been different this was my son one yeah ah no nineteen usual highly vaccine injured his mind was fried like toxic vaccines oh nice yes well fun because this is it's fun this is reality go to our vaccine safe word find out the real news from investigate before you vaccinate could save yourself and your loved ones the life of destruction
1,alright guys a bunch of you have requested for me to respond to this video so here it is we haven't talked about vaccinations in a while now so why not revisit it i know i know it's not the most interesting topic even for me but i think it's a necessary one before we begin i would like to give a shout out to fireshard and nathan gower for being the current top two patrons thanks to you and all other patrons for making what i do possible anyway without further ado let's talk vaccines this is a special edition of africa watch with me dr mumbi saraki on the dr mumbi show i'm curious what qualifications do you have to call yourself a doctor for me my channel is called professor stick but i'm not an actual professor so this is more of a channel name is that the same for you or do you actually have an md or phd last week i did a special show where i talked about how the elimination of the african population is in full gear with vaccines i give an example of how the polio vaccine was being rolled out in kenya okay i definitely need to go check out that video later um all right all alright this is the first time i've heard a claim like this that the purpose of distributing vaccinations is to eliminate the african population let me just begin by saying that's not true the purpose of vaccines is to protect people from certain diseases you mentioned the polio vaccine yep that's to prevent your body from being attacked by polio in no way shape or form is this being done to kill people just think about it what's the actual point of genocide why would the first world countries distributing vaccinations want to kill people in africa what would they even gain from that rather it's the opposite healthcare providers care about the well-beings of others and surprise surprise that includes other countries too vaccines are one of the most powerful tools we have to eliminating detrimental infections by taking advantage of the immune system the science behind it is undoubtedly sturdy it makes me sad when people deny the most basic facts of physiology and then discourage people from receiving health care that would improve their lives and kind of as a slap in the national face the president released a presidential directive something i don't think he's ever done in his five six years of presidency where he um ordered every county government to make sure that the children are vaccinated and i seriously wept for my nation and i weave for the ignoramus seriously though it must be tough on your emotions if you think that governments are out to deceive and kill you how do you live a life of paranoia i wouldn't be able to do it and you know there was overwhelming overwhelming response to this video and overwhelming evidence of people talking about how they knew vaccines caused disease they and some even giving examples of their own children becoming autistic of their own children developing eczema of their own children developing asthma after forced vaccinations okay so it seems you value the testimonies of random people rather than actual scientific evidence all right let me put it this way for you who would you rather believe the work of thousands and thousands of scientists who have dedicated their lives to studying immunology and diseases that say vaccinations will prevent you from receiving deadly infections or a few people who know nothing about science claiming that vaccinations cause autism because their child has autism and so happen to have also received a vaccine take your pick the point is science doesn't work with anecdotes random stories from random individuals have very little influence on what is scientifically true partly because testimonies are never consistent there are too many other factors at play for example if someone says eating potatoes obsessed the stomach that doesn't mean potatoes has a biological mechanism that destroys your stomach just like how if someone claims vaccinations cause autism or asthma it doesn't mean it does what scientists do is that they conduct studies and experiments and try to work out the actual causes and effects of substances you would need hundreds if not thousands of participants all experiencing a very specific and controlled setting and measure their reactions to it then draw a correlation and work out the p-value there is rigorous analyses procedures when it comes to science and vaccinations is no exception just a few testimonies from random individuals mean nothing it's not controlled it doesn't produce analyzable data and it's biased there's a reason the scientific method exists now you know in the u.s you have to get your children vaccinated for them to join school let me get this straight you think vaccinations kill people as eminem from earlier when you said last week i did a special show where i talked about how the elimination of the african population is in full gear with vaccine but now you're acknowledging that in the u.s vaccinations is mandatory for children to attend school i don't know what drove you to think that vaccinations is a conspiracy to kill off people in your country but it seems dumb to also be using this on children of your own country doesn't it oh and what do you know these children grow up to become full adults too like for example i had all the required and recommended vaccination shots myself and surprise surprise i'm still alive as with millions of americans the reason children are required to have many vaccinations if able before attending school is so that certain diseases don't get spread around within that school environment as long as everyone is vaccinated pathogens won't be able to spread around even to people who haven't been vaccinated this is due to herd immunity we haven't reached them that here yet in kenya or in most african nations but what happens is people trust their physicians and doctors so much they see them like the second god which is just total insanity that um they will do whatever the doctor orders and they're even afraid to question some of the things i've written here let's just think about that for a second here your doctor assuming he is an md or do and works in the us has gone through many years of studying and many years of training after high school that's four years of college four years of medical school and three to eight years of residency depending on their specialty and do you know how much work they get as a resident for however many years they have to work 80 hour weeks in fact it used to be worse which is why a law was created to cap that number of hours but because there's no whistleblower protection many residents still work over 80 hours per week that's almost 12 hours per day including weekends or if not including weekends that's 16 hours a day and it's not uncommon for them to work 30 hours straight on a single shift and even after you're done being a resident you still work over 60 hour weeks for the rest of your life this here is the minor reason i turned down medical school myself and is also the reason i hate it when people don't respect their doctors these guys work so much to help people and they've sacrificed so much of their lives to do so to become the experts on their field so please don't think you know more than your doctor they have trained rigorously to get where they are listen to them they know what's best for you but of course that's only in the united states i have lived in multiple countries myself and doctors seem to work just as much in those countries too i don't know how it is in kenya or any other african nation but i can assume they've also worked hard to get where they are but a few physicians actually reached out to me with some very valuable information that i wanted to share with you what isn't that just a tad bit hypocritical because we must remember that vaccines cause cancer they cause autism they cause eczema they cause asthma there's so much overwhelming proof phenomenal absolutely phenomenal now if you could just show me these studies and experiments you know the papers that are written instead of just random testimonies that'd be great or i could just tell you instead what science says vaccinations don't directly cause any of those the only major harm it could cause is if you have a severe allergic reaction to it but the chances of that is lower than being struck by lightning it's funny how you mentioned cancer here because if anything vaccinations would lower your chances of cancer if you take the hpv vaccine for example it will significantly reduce your chances of cervical cancer and it's not just hpv viruses themselves can cause cells to become tumorous simply due to the fact that they want to encourage host cell replication in order to divide to increase its own numbers high cell growth and division is a property of tumor cells vaccinating against these viruses will prevent their infection thus reducing your chances of cancer of course the majority of tumors don't come from viruses so vaccines won't guarantee you'll become cancer free i just thought it was funny how she thought vaccines caused cancer when in reality it would be in the opposite direction do your own research do your own research my opinion is that this saying is valid unless it's outside your scope of understanding like for most people who aren't doctors or researchers medicine now everything i'm going to suggest please you know seek medical advice before you do it i know medical advice from the doctors who are vaccinating you but try and look for a holistic healer try and look for you know um operate with discernment and and because i'm really just here to help you what do you guys think about alternative medicine doctors do you think they should be allowed by law to practice leave your opinion down below now first uh a physician sent me this information and they said if you want to detox from a vaccine and you just got vaccinated or your child just got vaccinated if you just got vaccinated they said um you can purge it from your system before it's absorbed into your body the way to use do that is to use castor oil and epsom salt i what it's already injected into your bloodstream it's already in your body how would you even get rid of it before quote your body absorbs it what certain things in your blood isn't in your body yet okay for the next part she just goes on about the exact procedure you should do to detox from those horrible vaccinations and other things you can do for general health like this you know just to deal with all viruses this is what he suggested i don't know please do your research uh but he told me we gotta be grown about this um insert the garlic into your animal okay i think we've seen enough man you guys send me the most interesting video suggestions if you have any other video suggestions go ahead and put it in the future video ideas channel on my discord server no guarantees though i've actually made a video a long time ago giving a few criteria i look for when considering the videos you guys send me i'll try to dig it up and link that video down below so you guys know how i select videos to respond to that's if you want to send me a video that is okay cool before i end the video i would like to give another shout out to fireshard for being the top tier patreon this month i'll see you guys next week damn it's almost halloween god damn it you
0,three civil rights king von ocher roll 27:36 dr. King this church is as good a place as any to go back over your commitment to the civil rights movement well you went out from here into University and then you went to Montgomery Alabama and started the bus boycotts there what was the philosophy of the civil rights movement as you saw it then more than ten years ago well I would say then the philosophy was that we must go all out to use legal and nonviolent methods to gain full citizenship rights for the Negro people of our country of course that particular struggle and that philosophy is centered on breaking down all of the barriers of legal segregation so I would say that in that period the basic thrust for the gaining of citizenship rights for Negroes was to end the humiliation surrounding the whole system of legal segregation dr. king was there something peculiar to the place where you started and the kind of people you attracted I mean by that there was a strong attachment on the part of your parishioners in Montgomery to the church they were older people weren't they yes I would say by and large they were older people who participated in the boycott because they were the ones using the bus bus more than anybody else and Montgomery was a community predominantly Church Senate so that it was very easy to get to the vast majority of Negroes because they were in some way connected with a church in the community in addition to your commitment to the idea of non-violence wasn't it also the only thing you could do the white community having the monopoly on once that if you had tried violence they would have met it with violence it was the only device open to you wasn't it well I put it another way that morally I was led to non-violence because I felt that it was the best moral way to deal with the problem we were seeking to establish a just society and it was my feeling then and it is my feeling now that violence is certainly much more socially destructive and it creates many more social problems than it solves so I was led to non-violence for deep moral reasons now there is no doubt about the fact that in our struggle in Montgomery and all over the United States for that matter non-violence is also practically sound it would just be impractical for the Negro to turn to violence he has neither the instruments now the techniques of violence we about ten or eleven percent of the total population of the nation and I would say we about one-tenth of one percent of the firepower so it would just be totally impractical and unwise and unrealistic for the Negro to think of violence well I saw this in the beginning and Montgomery but this wasn't the basic reason that I turned to non-violence and that I believed in it as a philosophy I turned to it because I felt that it was the morally excellent way to deal with the problem of racial injustice in our country is there something about non-violence that made it and I used that in the past tense that made it more useful amongst other Negroes than the ghetto Negroes of the north I would say there's anything that makes it more useful to southern Negroes I think it is true that we've had more nonviolent movements in the south because the problem for many years was more crystallized and in a sense more visible in the south we didn't have many civil rights activities on a massive scale in the north until three or four years ago so I would say that we just haven't had a chance to experiment on a broad scale with non-violence in the northern ghetto I have the feeling that non-violence is as applicable and workable in the northern ghetto as it is in the South now there's a larger job there the frustrations at points are much deeper the bitterness is deeper and I think that's because in the South we can see pockets of progress here and there we've really made some strides that are very visible and every southern Negro knows that he can do things today that he couldn't do four or five years ago where and in the North the Negro sees on their retrogress and he doesn't find it as easy to get his vision centered on his target the target of opposition as he does in the south consequently this is made for despair and it men appoint cynicism a feeling that you can't win and it simply means that we've got to develop in the mouth a massive job of organization and mobilizing forces and resources to deal with the problem and there have been ghettos of the north just as we've done it in the south when the south particularly in Alabama you had visible villains Jim Clark Bull Connor cattle prods police dogs but in the North you don't have those visible villains isn't it hard to get your people aroused and directed it's something that isn't visible well that's exactly right and this is what I was saying when I said it's harder to see your target in the South in the nonviolent movement we were aided always the whole by the brutality of our opponent it isn't the same way in the north the other thing is that you don't have legal segregation in the north as you do in the south so it is much more difficult to get people to see exactly what you're doing but it isn't an impossible job it's it's a hard it's a tedious job at times to get people to be aroused from their apathetic slumbers but I still feel that Negroes in the north can be motivated just as they were motivated in the south and I think it's time goes on with the growing economic deprivation in the Negro community it will even be easier because people will come deceive and not only is something wrong in general but something is wrong in particular in their own economic and housing situations what is it I mean how do you find it it's very subtle in the north is it not it's subtle but it's becoming much more visible anybody can see that the schools are more segregated in the north today than they were in 1954 when the Supreme Court rendered its decision declaring segregation unconstitutional anybody can look around the ghetto and see the ghetto schools are predominantly segregated and devoid of quality anyone who moves through a major ghetto of our country will see the housing conditions people don't have to be reminded that they are forced to live in slums and many instances and they often rat-infested vermin feel slums and they didn't too hard to see the exploitation that the Negro confronting the ghetto where he is forced to pay more for less and constantly trying to make ends meet but because of either no job as a result of unemployment our job that is so economically unprofitable that the person can make I mean and I think they see all of these things and more and more they are coming to see them because before the people of the North were looking to the south and they supported the struggles of the south now they are coming to see that their problems are very real and they've got organized to grapple with them was there something hypocritical about the fact that the South existed in the North could point the finger and then when the civil rights acts were passed in the early 60s you couldn't point the finger anymore well there was no doubt about the hypocrisy of large segments of the nation on the whole question of racial equality I think the best example is that many of the senators from the north and the West and congressmen generally who voted for civil rights legislation in 6 to 4 and even 6 to 5 of the voting rights bill refused last year to vote for civil rights legislation because it dealt with an issue applicable to the north the whole housing question and this it seems to me was the greatest expression of the hypocrisy of many of our citizens and many of the senators and congressmen of the nul but isn't that part of the dilemma now that people knew that Negroes were being being denied what was guaranteed to them by the Constitution by the fact that they were citizens of this country then when they were given those rights do you feel the white community said well we've given them all that we have now it's up to them well I think the dilemma is much deeper and I think one during this period of transition has to be very honest with America and honesty impels me to admit that America has broad races elements still alive racism is still existing in American society in many areas of the society northern South and the other thing is that there has never been a single solid determined commitment of large segments of white camara America on the whole question of racial equality I think we have to see that vacillation has always existed ambivalence has always existed and this to me is the so-called white backlash is merely a new name for an old phenomenon I see the white backlash is a continuation of the same ambivalence and vacillation of white america and the whole question of racial justice that existed since the founding of our nation I think the other thing that we must see at this time is that many of the people who supported us in Selma in Birmingham were really outraged about the extremist behavior toward Negroes but they were not at that moment and they are not now committed to genuine equality for Negroes it's much easier to integrate a lunch counter than it is to guarantee an annual income for instance to get rid of poverty for Negroes and all poor people it's much easier to integrate a bus than it is to make genuine integration of reality and quality education a reality in our schools it's much easier to integrate even a public park than it is to get rid of slums and I think we are in a new era a new phase of the struggle where we have moved from a struggle for decency which characterized our struggle for 10 or 12 years to a struggle for genuine equality and this is where we are getting the resistance because there was never any intention to go this fall people were reacting to Bull Connor and to Jim Clarke rather than acting in good faith for the realization of genuine equality do you think white people in this country and I'm talking about non segregationist people devoid or thinking they're devoid of racism do you have any idea of what they want the Negro to be in America well it depends on the level that we are talking here because I think you have to make a distinction between the people who are genuinely and absolutely committed in the white community on the question of of racial equality and I must confess that I think they are a very small minority I think the vast majority of white Americans will go but so far it's a kind of installment plan for equality and they always looking for an excuse to go but so far why are they looking for the excuse what is it about the Negro I mean every other group that came as an immigrant somehow not easily but somehow got around it is it just the fact that Negroes are black that's a part of it and growing that grows out of something else you can't thing if I anything without de personalizing that something if you use something as a means to an end at that moment you make it a thing and you de personal eyes it the fact is that the Negro was a slave in this country for 244 years that act that was a willful thing that was done de Negro was brought he and changed treated in very human fashion and this led to the thing if occasion of the Negro so he was not looked upon as a person he was not looked upon as a human being with the same status and worth as other human beings and the other thing is that human beings cannot continue to do wrong without eventually rationalizing that wrong so slavery was justified morally biologically theoretically if scientifically everything else and it seems to me that white America must see that no other ethnic group has been a slave on American soil that is one thing other immigrant groups have had to face the other thing is that the color became a stigma American Society made the Negroes color a stigma and that can never be overlooked so I think these things absolutely necessary the other thing is that America freed the slaves in nineteen I'm in 1863 through the Emancipation Proclamation of Abraham Lincoln but gave the slaves no land nothing in reality and as a matter of fact to get started on at the same time America was giving away millions of acres of land in the West and the Midwest which meant that there was a willingness to give the white peasants from Europe an economic base and yet it refused to give its black peasants from Africa who came here involuntarily in Chains and had worked free for 244 years any kind of economic base and so emancipation for the Negro was really freedom to hung it was freedom to the winds and rains of heaven it was freedom without food heed a land to cultivate and therefore was freedom and famine at the same time and when white Americans tell the Negro to lift himself by his own bootstraps they don't owe they don't look over the legacy of slavery and segregation I believe we ought to do all we can and seek to lift ourselves by our bootstraps but it's a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps and many negroes by the thousands and millions have been left bootless as a result of all of these years of oppression and as a result of a society that deliberately made his color of stigma and something worthless and degrading apart from wanting to live better which all of us want to do to raise one's children in a better way to be better does the Negro in America know what he wants to be I'm convinced that almost every Negro in this country other than those who have been so scarred by the system that they've become pathological in the process and we all have to battle with pathology nobody really knows what it means to be a negro unless one can really experience it and I know we all have to battle with this constant drain of a feeling of nobody nice but in spite of this I think the vast majority of Negroes in this country know that they want to be people they want to be men they want equality period it just boils down to that and we haven't been able to be people we haven't been men because of all of the conditions that we've lived with and the syndrome of deprivation surrounding conditions rather than housing in the economic area or in schools in the vicious credit practices that we face in the ghetto and all of the problems of closed doors and constant defeats but in spite of all this I think we all know basically that we want to be men we want to be persons judged not on the basis of the color of our skin but on the basis of the content of our character but you know that many young Negroes don't want anything that smacks of the American white middle class but do they want something that smacks of whatever is the black middle class or do they just not want bourgeois values which after all the basis of this democracy well I think we have to see what they are saying I would be the first to agree that integration does not mean giving up everything that has an afro-american taint so to speak a background I think there are certain unique things within any culture and certain cultural patterns that when you get to the process of amalgamation can really lift the whole culture and it seems to me that integration at its best is the opportunity to participate in the beauty of diversity I think the other thing that we've got to see is that these young people are saying that there must be a revolution of values in our country as Jimmy Baldwin said on one occasion what advantage is there in being integrated into a burning house and I feel that there is a need for a revolution of values in America because some of the values that presently exists are certainly out of line with the values and the idealistic structure that brought our nation into being unfortunately we haven't been true to these own ideals and many of the values of so called white middle-class scientist society of values that need to be reviewed and re-evaluated and in a real sense they need to be changed so I think the young people in the Negro community who were raising these questions are raising some very profound questions about our total society in other words they are saying that there must be a restructuring of the architecture of our society where values are concerned and with this I would agree with so in the quest for integration I think we can offer our whole nation something because there are three evils in our nation it's not only racism but economic exploitation of poverty would be one and then militarism and I think in a sense and in a very real sense these three are tied inextricably together and we aren't going to get rid of one without getting rid of the other we you stood in the Lincoln Memorial that day in August 63 and you said I had a dream did that dream envision that you could see a war in Asia preventing the federal government doing for the needless preventing the society doing for the Negroes of that what you think had to be done no I didn't envision that then I must confess that that period was a great period of hope for me and I'm sure many others all across the nation many of the Negroes who had about lost hope saw a solid decade of progress in the south and in 1954 which was I mean six to four nineteen six to three nine years after the Supreme Court's decision to be in the march on Washington meant a great deal it was a high moment a great watershed moment but I must confess that that dream that I had that day has a many points turned into a nightmare now I'm not one to lose hope I keep on hoping I still have faith in the future but I've had to analyze many things over the last few years and I would say over the last few months I've gone through a lot of souls such an in agonizing moments and I've come to see that we have many more difficult days ahead and some of the old optimism was a little superficial and now it must be tempered with a solid realism and I think the realistic fact is that we still have a long long way to go and that we are involved in a war on Asian soil which if not checked and stop and pause in the very soul of our nation dr. King even if there had not been a war in Asia would you still not have had this nightmare insofar as the Negro movement for equality then touched on two things that the white community holds sacred their children and the property oh I have no doubt that we would have been encountered great difficulties great problems of resistance if the war had not been in existence so that I'm not going to say that all of our problems will be solved at the war in Vietnam has ended but I do say that the wall makes it infinitely more difficult to deal with these problems when a nation becomes obsessed with the guns of war it loses its social perspective and programs of social uplift suffer this is just a fact of history so that we do face many more difficulties as a result of the war it's much more difficult to really arouse the conscience during a time of war notice the other day some weeks ago a Negro was shot down in Chicago and it was a clear case of police brutality that was on page 30 of the paper but on page one at the top was 708 a Vietcong kill that is something about a war like this that makes people insensitive it dulls the conscience it strengthens the forces of reaction and it brings into being bitterness and hatred and violence and it's strengthen the military-industrial complex of our country and it's made our job much more difficult because I think we can go along with some programs if we didn't have this war on our hands that would cause people to adjust to new developments just as they did in the south they said they'd never ride the bus with us blood would flow in the streets they wouldn't go to school and all of these things but when people came to see that they had to do it because the law insisted they finally adjusted and I think white people all over this country will adjust once the nation makes it clear that in schools and housing we've got to learn to live together as brothers I think the biggest problem now is that we got our gains over the last 12 years at bargain rates so to speak didn't cost the nation anything in fact it helped the economic side of the nation to integrate lunch counters and public accommodations it didn't cost the nation anything to get the right to vote establish and now we are confronting issues that cannot be solved without costing the nation billions of dollars now I think this is where we are getting our greatest resistance they may put it on many other things but we can't get rid of slums and poverty without a cost in donation something hey NBC News viewers thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over here to watch the latest interviews show highlights and digital exclusives thanks for watching
0,do all christians think the same suggested by wig connick probably not but let's find out stick around till the end enjoy the episode you're like well i want to love who i want to love there's that attraction it's like where do you draw the line i'm a grown man i like little boys i know you don't agree with that and i know that it is the same i like christian music three two one go oh man some christian music is good and some of it is lame but that's the same with like any kind of any genre music is the same way i have to be like in a certain setting or a certain mind state to listen to it i kind of agree that some is good and some is bad but i kind of feel like 60 to 70 of it is not good or like exciting but maybe i'm kind of traumatized because i could only listen to christian music when i was a kid so now i'm like that's relatable yeah that might be part of it two one go i mean i'm gay i'm from like a little town in texas it's difficult to not question your faith because you're told that gay people can't be christians or christians can only follow these certain rules that are set out so for me when i started to grow and to get a relationship with christianity myself is whenever my faith became stronger but it was definitely difficult and i'm still really going through that right now there were things that i felt like i was born knowing that god loved me and that god was good and then when i came into the church a little bit later there were some beliefs because i'm queer so that people were just like this is what it is and you can't be this and like this is not but the reason i'm in this line is because i never felt that from god i still felt like he loves me i support the lgbt community when we mention support it means to accept and i don't accept the lifestyles within the community but do i love them do i want the best for them i absolutely do do i think that we should be mean to them in church do i think that we should shun them from church no and i'm sorry that you guys had that experience because that is awful that is horrible no one should go to a church and feel like you need to run away from it it's interesting though because the thing that has hurt me the most is actually the language with which you're speaking which is more confusing i think no one actually shunned me it was more like this more like i love you but like god kind of wants to like send you to hell i do have christian friends who are queer or gay and they're struggling they're abstaining from the lifestyle but the lgbtq community says there's nothing wrong with that lifestyle they're proud of that status not remorseful or trying to be aligned with what the bible says about it you are literally picking one part of the bible that you believe and throwing away everything else there's like certain materials that we're not supposed to wear there's certain foods that we're not supposed to eat but we don't discriminate against people who do that but we do discriminate against people who literally just love someone different if you're gonna disagree with it you also have to understand like the weight of what you are asking a queer person to do when you look at someone and you feel like they're attractive and you have to disagree with that part of yourself every second of the day you have to tell yourself that's freaking wrong that's freaking wrong at like every second like you don't think that i should i should not marry a woman that i love i'm not saying you should be alone i'm saying at the basis of anything i want you to be who god created you to be and i know that for you you're believing that i was created this way to love this way but i would actually wonder because you're like well i want to love who i want to love there's that attraction but when i it's like where do you draw the line when there's i'm attract i'm a grown man i like little boys i am a person and i know that you don't agree with that but there are lines because i know you don't agree with that and i know that it is the same i think the lgbt is like a huge topic within the christian community but it doesn't make it any worse than like i drink and stuff and sometimes i drink in excess which is the sin um but it just doesn't get that's normalized you know i mean like that doesn't get attacked as frequently as like a lgbt would the community would you know what i mean i just define support differently i think you can completely support somebody's right to love and feel love without supporting homosexual activity homosexual activity is sinful raping a child is sinful we can argue about what's worse or what's more acceptable or what our society has normalized but the end of the day we all sin we all sin in different ways and none of those sins should be celebrated none of those sins should be condoned and all of us should be working not to change who we are but to become more like christ god loves you got some explaining to do over there it sounds great to say god loves everybody and does and god does love everybody but i don't believe equally he loves his own children more than the others in the world he would not send someone that he loves truly to hell he is love that's what his embodiment is so i think it's impossible for him to not show love towards his children i don't think it's there's varying degrees i think it's all standardized against everyone like everyone is left equally go sorry i'll go on this one i am married i've been married for almost 10 years to a christian man for me what i feel in the bible that god describes as a christian family is two people husband and wife who are devoted to serving the lord together and we need somebody to come alongside us who is helping us to pursue our purpose and our calling in christ it's totally possible and often happens that people of different religions or someone who's a christian and that doesn't have a religion at all are able to still work together and are able to still help people grow in their faith i totally agree that i could learn from non-christians even benefit from relationships with muslims buddhists or other non-christians but the bible is specific about not being yoked in marriage to unbelievers whether you're a muslim christian or a buddhist you find someone who doesn't share that i think you're missing something core in that relationship which won't work for any marriage but the thing is uh when you break down so many of the major religions a lot of the tenets are the same and we kind of believe the same thing inherently but that's where i disagree i think we're very different in terms of what we believe that we may have similar activities like going to church or a mosque but what i personally believe about jesus is not shared with other religions no one else agrees with that i am waiting to have sex until marriage three two one go i wish i could be over there but i can't unfortunately i made some bad decisions when i was younger the people that i've been with prior there's always a piece of me with them you know what i mean like it's something i can never get back it kind of bums me out a lot because it's like i wish i could have saved myself all the way until marriage um in all aspects of physical relations party sold but i do think that as a christian i should be dating to find someone to be with long term or finding someone to marry and so part of that does involve sometimes waiting a little bit longer waiting longer to like have sex and to like really be intimate so i personally am actually not even kissing until i get engaged which a lot of people don't believe me about but i had a two-year relationship and i promise it happened i didn't particularly like it but i just find so much strength and closeness to god in preserving my physical expression of love for people even though it's very very far from easy it's something i'm so excited for to be able to tell that person i saved this the most intimate part of myself for you because god was the only one who had a key to my heart before this yeah i'm not saying that i'm a good person but i'm saved by faith in jesus christ who forgives me of my sin i know where i place my faith and that's why i know where i'm gonna go i don't know it's hard to know exactly what specifically is considered the biggest sins that will keep someone from going to heaven especially for me when i haven't put as much thought into it as i should christianity is not about just making sure you're checking off all the boxes to go to heaven i feel like that robs us of the heaven that's present here on earth all i'm responsible for is doing my best every day and i pray that i do that every day and i think that's true for everybody everybody is just responsible for their best dude i feel like i could probably step on every one of these lines at a different point in my life because i grew up a christian but like changed so much

0,"- I get a call from her mother-in-law, she's like, ""We have a problem. ""I hate lavender!"" (soft music) My name's Leora and my
 company is Best Bride. I have been a wedding
 planner for six years now. - Hi there, I'm Katie Hall Goodman and I own Best Day Ever LA Events. I've been planning weddings
 professionally for five years. (playful music) - It's wedding day and everything's going absolutely perfect. Obviously the bride needs
 to start a lot earlier. She's just about finishing her hair, and typically when we get at that stage we'll start getting the groom ready. He's putting his pants on and we realize it is short and tight. He tries his shirt and
 it doesn't fit either. Everything in his garment
 bag does not fit him. He had his last fitting and he went to pick up the tux, I'm like, ""Did you try it
 when you picked it up?"" ""No."" It was the wrong tux. None of the groomsman tux fit him. Best thing to do at that point
 is we gotta go buy a tux. People usually go shopping
 and they're like la, trying to find what they want, and here we are literally
 like two crazy people, like, ""Where is the dress shirts?"" He's so picky, ""But I don't like the length of this, ""but I don't like the fit, ""I wanted high waisted, I want
 the collar to be like that, ""this is too white, I
 ordered ivory cream."" I'm like listen, at this point
 we just need to buy something and we need to go. We end up buying eight
 shirts, six different tuxes. I'm literally pulling him out of the mall, he's like, ""This isn't what I wanted, ""this isn't what I wanted
 to look on my wedding day. ""I think we have to postpone."" I'm like we're not gonna
 postpone your wedding because you got the wrong tux. We go back. So the bride is practically ready. Once she saw him and
 the first look happened, she's like, ""Babe, is this the tux? ""It looks kind of different."" We're like, ""Oh, no, no, no, ""it's probably just the lighting."" You know, obviously the day
 went by, they were happy. No one even cared at the end. All I have to say is, please try on your tux
 when you pick it up. - So for this particular wedding, it took place at a really
 nice kind of funky hotel in West Hollywood. Beforehand, I had had some issues with the mother of the bride because they were trying to
 cut corners and cut costs anywhere that they could. They had a higher guest count. I told her, you know, you're gonna have to hire extra staff, you're gonna have to
 hire extra bartenders. People are gonna line up at
 the bars during cocktail hour and it's gonna be a line, and no one's gonna have fun with that. But she decided against that, so on the wedding day, of course, the bars were super backed up because after the ceremony, what do people wanna do? Drink. And so she started literally
 going up to the bartenders and grabbing them and being like, ""Bring water, bring wine!"" And at one point she smacked a server, which is assault. We had to pull her aside
 to be like this is assault, please don't do this. Obviously that was not the tone I took because on the day I'm like,
 ""Can you please not do that."" People almost were going to press charges, it got that bad. We almost had to take
 the mother of the bride and remove her from the wedding day, but obviously that would be awful and something that she would never forget and the bride would never forget. So I was able to talk
 down the venue manager. I persuaded him with some alcohol later, said I would buy you
 cocktails if you just let this mother of the bride chill out, and take a breath, and take a breather. But essentially, we just
 put a smile on her face, I asked her to come with me and I asked her to take a deep breath, let her know that we will
 have extra bartenders on staff to make things go more efficiently. Moral of the story is do not assault servers
 and just hire extra staff. - It's two days before the wedding, we finish everything very early on, and I really try to give
 them that last week to enjoy. It's your time to go to the spa, relax, I'm not gonna bother you and I don't want you to bother me either. Everything's absolutely perfect and I'm gonna see you on your wedding day. So, I get a call, this time
 it's not from the bride, I get a call from her mother-in-law, and I haven't ever heard
 from the mother-in-law, she's not been involved
 in the planning process, she didn't come to any meetings, I literally met her the day they booked me and I need saw her again. She's like, ""We have a problem. ""I heard that you guys are
 having lavender color flowers."" and I'm like, ""Yeah."" She's like, ""I hate lavender!"" Lavender flowers was something
 that we discussed last year, and she's like, ""Well, lavender
 is dark, lavender is sad, ""lavender doesn't mean good things. ""Yellow means prosperity,
 yellow has good meaning. ""Why didn't anyone consult with me? ""I should have chosen the flowers."" 10 minutes later I get
 a call from the bride. ""There is no way I'm changing
 the colors of my flowers. ""I told you the day I hired
 you, I love lavender flowers."" I'm like, ""Listen, don't worry,
 this happens all the time. ""We're not changing anything, no worries."" It's the wedding day, and everything's getting set up and then I see a vendor loading in that is not one of our vendors. The next thing I see a cart rolling in by their workers with
 tons of yellow flowers. They're like, ""Hey, we're the florists, ""we're here to bring the flowers."" And I'm like, uh, I mean, the flowers are basically done. They're like, ""I've been hired by (beep), ""she said it's her sons wedding ""and we're bringing in the flowers."" This lady obviously didn't
 listen to anything anyone said or anything the bride wanted. She went and hired a different florist to bring the color flowers that she likes. She ordered tons of these yellow flowers. I'm like, ""Listen, I'll take care of it, ""just please leave the flowers here. ""Thank you guys so much."" A little bit later, the
 mother-in-law walks downstairs. She's like, ""Oh my god,
 everything looks great, ""This way everyone can be happy."" I'm like, ""What do you mean?"" and she's like, ""Well, yeah, ""the yellow flowers are
 gonna go on my tables, ""and those are gonna be for my guests."" And I'm like, nuh-uh. My florist is not gonna
 let another florist to mix in flowers, this is not how this works, honey. She's babbling on and on,
 ""No, but I ordered them, ""I thought this way
 everybody can be happy. ""I get the yellow, she gets the."" It's not about what you get she gets, this isn't kindergarten. At that point, her hair
 stylist is calling her to retouch her hair and makeup, she's so concerned about that, she leaves. She's like, ""You make sure
 to get it on those tables."" I'm like, okay. As wedding planners, we
 have to build that harmony. I had the hotel put it in
 the big table they have when you enter the lobby. She was happy. I mean, she came in, she's like's like, ""Ah, it's the first thing
 they see, thank you!"" She thought we were honoring her. I guess it all worked out. - So little things happen
 at every single wedding, I feel like one bad thing
 might happen at each wedding. There was this one wedding I did where there were these little incidences where I was like, what's going on? At the rehearsal I was
 lining everybody up, doing the processional, and this little boy punched me the (beep). He literally just came up
 to me and was like (grunts). It was the weirdest thing. The bride is a friend of mine, she was horrified, but the boy's mom didn't say anything, she just was just kind of like, oh, huh. Not a big deal 'cause
 I'm fine, but whatever. This wedding was taking
 place in Santa Barbara at this adorable kind of
 country outdoor venue. So a lot of times at outdoor venues, there's the added cost of knowing that you might have to rent a tent if the weather forecast is not good. These clients did not rent a tent, and because they did not rent a tent, of course it rained. It was literally all outdoors, there was nowhere that
 people could go indoors. I felt so bad for the guests because everyone was
 literally holding napkins above their head, there was one woman that was
 holding a napkin over her head, and who I assume was her date was feeding her her food. (laughs) It was so awful. And then at the end of the night, dances are done, everyone's good and shweisty, and we had hired vans because
 this is on a very windy road, and of course we don't
 want anyone to drive drunk. When the vans arrived
 to take 100 plus guests back into town to their hotels, we smelled something, and we
 were like, huh, what's that? And then I had a conversation with drivers (record needle scratching)
 and they're like oh, you're for sure high. Of course they're fired
 and they can't drive people because it's a huge liability. One of the groomsman was a sheriff, so he wanted to press charges
 and get these people arrested. Luckily, we were able to be like hey, let's just end the night, it was a fantastic night. So I was like, who can
 I get, who is sober, who can drive all these
 people back to town? There was a restaurant that
 was attached to this venue, and luckily, a few of the kitchen guys had not gone home yet, and I was like, ""Hey, if I
 give you some cash right now, ""can you drive these two vans into town ""and drive them back, and
 do that one more time, ""until all the guests are back into town?"" And they were like, ""Yeah, cool."" There were little instances that happened, but I still loved that wedding because the bride and
 groom were phenomenal. (playful music)"
0,"The phrase all lives matter was derived from black lives matter to subvert black lives matter and I won't come here and sit down and say That that's okay Can I have my law enforcement go to the left pool of light Can I have my black lives matter supporters go to the right pool of light I regularly fear for my life You know, I'm an armed patrol officer so I do Respond to burglar alarms. So if someone breaks into someone's house, have a gun I would have to respond to that certain situation. So I do fear for my life in a way I guess you can say 
 -I do something that, I think every black man, every black person in this country, many people of color have been trained to do and That's when a law enforcement officer gets behind me and I'm driving, I'm making sure I'm signaling. I'm checking my speed I'm thinking of all the different legitimate ways that you could stop me and in that moment I recognized and I realized that I'm not a scholar, with a bachelor's in political science a bachelor's in sociology a master's in public policy. 
 In that moment, I'm just another black man to that officer, and that scares me. I maybe could have stepped forward I feel scared for my life when I'm at work often when you get pulled over and all the thoughts and things that are going through your mind or where when I pull a car over I'm thinking about where I'm at on the highway, how I'm gonna pull this vehicle over, Did I run the plate? Did it come back to that vehicle? 
 Am I buckled in? Am I not buckled in? because most officers are shot and killed during traffic stops And as I approach I put my hand on that car to leave my handprint because if I'm shot and killed that person is further Incriminated by the evidence of my prints being on their car But I don't feel afraid for my life as a citizen but at work I definitely do and that's a choice I made I choose not to live in fear If the question was do I feel less safe now than I did five years ago I would say yes, and I think that that's because we have rampant social chaos That's expanding and I think that that's playing a large role in a lot of the trends that we're seeing - What do you mean by social chaos? Um, out of wedlock birth rates Statistically, you know that sets a child back five times more likely to be poor and nine times more likely to drop out of school And 20 times more likely to end up in prison. 
 -I mean the chaos that I'm seeing more recently is white men walking into schools with ar-15s and slaughtering people yeah,  and that is what you're seeing and what you're not seeing is the dozens of homicides that occur in Chicago on a daily basis and that speaks to Certainly a media that's desirous to push an agenda and a narrative. That factually doesn't bear out. 
 There is a massive disparity between black crime and white crime at large and obviously that's going to lead to accelerated interactions with law enforcement.
 -Or is it the criminalization of black people? 
 when you have more police officers patrolling a concentrated area then of course, you have more stops You have more you know situations where police officers say Oh, they didnt signal and then when I pulled them over 
 I pulled all occupants out of the car I searched the car I found this gun allegedly buried somewhere and all of a sudden now you have a crime. As a public defender The reputation is that you know, I'm going to lose most of my cases. I have won far more cases than I have lost My name is Alisa Blair. I am African American I'm also a criminal defense attorney. As a public defender I've seen the mistreatment of my clients I see the disproportionate incarceration of black and brown people and I see the excessive force used in arrests Police should be given more resources. I think police should definitely be given more resources so that they have other options besides killing people.
 Officers should have the resources available to them to handle a situation without casualties on either side. Yeah, I mean as an officer I appreciate hearing that from a member of the public and from a public defender and can speak to it for myself and my department and what I've seen in other departments in the area and know that we need more resources and different types of training communication techniques to de-escalate situations and different types of least force option techniques but as a small woman, I also want to be able to physically protect myself and it's It's a hard balance The largest expense for almost every municipality and county is Public Safety There's plenty of money But we don't have is enough implicit bias training the things that we carry about ourselves that define how we interpret who we're interacting with. We don't have enough contextualizing of the communities that you're serving draw officers from the communities from which they serve. That way when they go back and their policing their own community that's deeper than just the race of the officers So you think that black police officers need to be trained to be more sensitive to the black community? 
 Is that what you're saying? No. I think black officers that are policing black community should come from those communities. 
 And I think a white officer who comes from that community might even be more effective than a black officer from somewhere else. 
 -I agree And I think I think that that's a great point which is that an officer, a white officer, a black officer, a female officer, a hispanic officer, could be just as good as any other or better and that's because there are things other than skin color and I think that what's so concerning about this dialogue is that it is pushing us further back into black communities, white communities when really I thought that the goal of Martin Luther King was that we're gonna be moving to a society where we were being judged by the content of our character if we keep moving further into identifying based on our groups I think that we're doing a disservice to his message, which I think was very powerful and that united the country in many ways - But not at the time in Martin Luther King's time White folks hated him, it causes me to bristle and have an emotional reaction whenever somebody says You know black people are killing folks 50% in violent crimes and then says Martin Luther King united the country Martin Luther King would be down for Black Lives Matter The next statement is I believe that all lives matter It's a little bit surprising below all of this stuff below skin deeper than all this there is a Intrinsic god-given life that's put inside of all of us I think that it's concerning that any movement would reject the fundamental premise of that, while preaching for equality - Exactly. At that point, you're really not an equality movement if you're really only interested in speaking to your specific group I truly believe and I agree with everything that you say. Everyone deserves life and I believe that you know life is a gift Plain and simple all life counts -Yeah all life matters, all life deserves a chance - Yeah, I think that especially in this platform but also in the world in the country that we live in today stating that all lives matter takes away from the inequality that's happening in the world.
 Of course all lives matter. - It negates the fact that something has to be addressed and if you don't address it, and you don't recognize that there is a problem that has to be changed then you never fucking change it. But that's not our intention. Our intention was just an answer a simple question, but it's not (Talking over each other) - The question is framed as do all lives matter, if you ask me if all lives have intrinsic value, If all lives are valuable, if all lives are worthy I would have said ""hell yes"" and would have been the first one in my chair. All lives matter is a specific phrase similar to Blue Lives Matter and anything else that mattered after black lives were exclaimed to have mattered to detract, to appropriate, to subvert the message and the framing and the narrative that's being brought to us by the Black Lives Matter Movement So I don't think anybody here in this room thinks that any life is less worthy than another's. But the phrase all lives matter was derived from Black Lives Matter, to subvert Black Lives Matter and I won't come here and sit down and say that that's okay. - I mean, I feel like we're just kind of going into the weeds here.The question wasn't if black lives matter It was a simple question. Do you believe that all lives matter?-  You don't think that's an interesting phrase? Is that a phrase you use quite frequently before? - I think not really. I think that you can attach whatever you want right now. That's a thing I try and step back from you know Whatever sort of identity political stuff we have going on and I try and deal with things head-on Based on reality when someone says to me, do you think all lives matter? I answer unequivocably ""yes"", every time the same way if you ask me is black lives matter or female lives matter I will answer the same way. - Do black lives matter.? - Yes. They do. I had conflicting feelings about coming here today. -For me I was conflicted because I don't feel like I should speak for black oppression, but as a white woman I think that I can be of value to other white people who may not understand I'm Sandra Cruse Well, I'm from the 60s and I went to jail a lot for fighting for women's rights and as a human being I think it's important that I speak out and speak up for injustices - I'm feeling conflicted now as Someone who steps into the law enforcement side as if we are on opposite sides I am a law enforcement officer and a Black Lives Matter supporter. I find myself searching for what to do and how to make a difference and I've had moments of thinking about leaving the force I finally had a realization that this gives me an opportunity to have a different angle as a white woman and also as a police officer to potentially make a difference.
  Even if it's just with changing myself. - I didn't hesitate. I've been a civilian my entire life and I consider it an honor to have an opportunity to provide voice for law enforcement and the men and women that serve our communities I think it's fundamentally important for society to respect law enforcement men and women that serve our communities with tremendous honor and distinction end up getting a bad wrap and I think that that's very harmful. I think that it is important, I think it's imperative to speak whenever you have an opportunity to and I think that all of us in whatever movements we're part of or whatever belief systems were part of should use our gifts. - You know de-escalation training is sitting in a room like this with a PowerPoint and walking officers through scenarios and nothing, Nothing in a scenario is ever going to be like the real world. In defense of officers like only those of us that walk in the shoes of having a badge and a gun and being in these high-stress situations can really articulate what it's like to make these split-second decisions. With our training officers need to be in these types of discussions owning their shit and being like I did this wrong and I have this prejudice 
 and how can I sit with people who can teach me and change me? - This is what I think is sort of dangerous about a conversation like this Is that really the only thing that I want law enforcement being trained on is the law Okay there's nebulous conversation about thinking about how I think about things and -- - some of us in law enforcement think of ourselves as social workers with a gun - and that's concerning because your job is to enforce the law. 
 - As someone in the field who wants more de-escalation training It's not because I don't believe in a lot of the laws that I enforce and it is my job to enforce the law I'm not a law warning officer. That's not what I signed up to do, but we are given the discretion to make choices and that's why we need more training because we're human beings just in my perspective and I appreciate your support of law enforcement and your perspective - Yeah, and I appreciate your perspective as well as your your real service that you've done So and I don't want our disagreement...
 Certainly don't take away from my respect and admiration for your service. 
 -Thank you for your support. - I think we all respect the service of everyone who works to the service of others. 
 I don't think anybody in this room is against individual officers.
 The conversation is to take a step back and recognize that this institution is a relic of anglo policing from european culture, but also slave catching and deep-rooted racism in American policy and we need to take that step back and recenter this conversation on the fact that it's bigger than just an officer. - I think part of the problem is that we're still so segregated. Where do we go to have these conversations? Where do we go to learn from each other to break down the stereotypes? It's systemic and I am so thrilled that there's a Black Lives Matter Movement. 
 It's really exciting. - Guys thank you so much. I know this hasn't been an easy one, but I appreciate your time Feel free to continue the discussion if you'd like outside It's a pleasure I really appreciate you speaking your truth and hearing mine as well. I really appreciate all of you guys. Okay, real pleasure. -Likeways, yes, thank you.

0,that's I'm almost you're that's crazy you know swings and roundabouts so a while back my dad did a bit of family tree stuff so I've got like a little basic knowledge mostly I think I'm just gonna be English or on my dad's side of the family we were used living in the kind of Eastern European area so maybe if I have anything interesting it's probably gonna come from that for me well I've got kind of mixed heritage my mum's from Nigeria and my dad was born in Jamaica but my mum is quite fair she's like really really light skinned so I think there might be like a throwback European Jean in there somewhere so I'm going to say like maybe just to mix up a little bit like ten percent European some way for me I'm expecting to find out that I'm half Italian and half English my dad both his parents moved over to the UK after the war and they're both Italian my dad's dad is from Sicily and my dad's mom is from mainland Italy so I expect it to be sort of a mix between English and Italian I think I'll probably just be 100% English it's really really uninspiring an exciting I mean shortly my surname is kind of a bit German French but otherwise just canal town indoor beads what about you well I think my mum's mum was Irish so I think I was 25% me already accounted for my last name Percy which is PE rcy what the Percy families were actually the most powerful noble family in England in the Middle Ages so I'm thinking you know some royal roots but the evolution of that name came from the French perceive with an eye so I think there'll be some French roots in there as well that sort of trickle down through hundreds of years so I'm really excited to see what else it could be I've no idea oh well that's when all over myself that wasn't even in the tube that was everywhere by adhesive there we go okay my biohazard is ready it's ready so it's been a couple of weeks since we send our vital spit off to the lab they've obviously been doing something with it but we're just I've been so nervous already so your prediction was 25% Irish with French roots and as a total you are 99.9 percent European okay and that 76.8% British and Irish and then 11.1% French and German German it's entirely German there's none of it French none Roger Tribby on and then 1.1 percent Scandinavian and then one more thing which is just based on all of yours of DNA relatives on the site and it tells you the sort of percentages of those relatives and what they're more likely or not likely to do 32 percent more likely to have worked as a lifeguard bit more glamorous and a lifeguard but I am really nice I look great in a red swimsuit yeah the other thing that the site tells you is how many Neanderthal variants you have genes you have the came originally from the end of those you have 275 you have 275 variants but it does mean that you have the genetic variant which is associated from having less back hair you know swings and roundabouts if mines are hot okay I'm so ready for your my dog okay so you said 100 selling glitch prediction your hundred percent European okay British and Irish seventy four point two percent me and that's London primarily but then also a big group in Manchester South Yorkshire and Lancashire yeah we guessed Sheffield is that region so that explains my dad sorry but none London nation Guinea dungeon French and German 7.8% Scandinavians 6.3% okay okay expect somewhere somewhere the ice from somewhere yeah and then otherwise it's just broadly Northwest North Western European eleven point five and broadly European not point two so that's can't pin it down okay and so you have three hundred and eighteen Neanderthal variants which is more than 96% of 23 million customers so you do have the variant associated with having less back hair very social person I'd like to think that they all yeah we mind you did the profiles like okay 48.6% is Ashkenazi Jewish Wow pretty accurate yeah and then 32.1% British Scandinavian 4.7% oh wow no I didn't know that's cool and the Netherlands or Germany 2.9% okay yeah I mean that's pretty much along the lines of why I expected obviously like pretty much half Jewish of non Jewish and I knew that the immigrants can it came from that sort of area of Europe so yeah not too many surprises that but he's pretty happy with a Latino didn't know about the Scandinavia and that's cool got a tiny bit of Viking in me the other thing is awesome Attica Lee finds your sort DNA relatives all of the relatives are seventy six percent less likely to have lived in there farm when they were young 49 percent more likely to warm braces on their teeth I had braces that's yeah pretty accurate and 58 percent less likely to drink energy drinks yeah I'm not much of a Red Bull guy so is that because of sugar do you know how the sugar affect you I've got no idea the normal amount I think sub-saharan African 97.6% yeah why four so quite I've been quite a big percentage and that is 72.2% Nigerian oh okay that's quite a lot and then 8.2% Congolese that makes sense actually we can about that because my my dad's from Jamaica and but he's quite dark he's like where's this nice quite dark levels and if you see him he does look very very sort like Central African surprise is he gonna be surprised about that he's gotta be six point two percent coastal West African not point four percent southern East African okay it's interesting and then North point one percent African hunter-gatherers and then your possible European throwback gene you have two point four percent European oh there we go which is one point one percent British and Irish you most likely had a third fourth fifth or sixth great-grandparent it was a hundred percent British or Irish this person was likely born between 1750 and 1840 and then you're sort of DNA relatives online they are 102 percent more likely to feel jittery what after drinking caffeine yes a hard you said yeah I can't have as you guys know I've got drink to your coffee 52% more like to have a perfect pitch that's where you can like so you could sing like a c-note get this guy in x-factor next season I scared definitely on your father's side going way way back you have a distant relative and this is a sort of 73 thousand year old relative with Pharaoh Ramses the third so your great-grandfather 73 thousand years is also his great-grandfather oh my okay let me to that point related to royalty on earth way way back but yeah I can kind of say that yeah don't only go to ad 28.2% Italian okay that's that's less than I thought it would be I mean 28 that's like just over a quarter so that's that's definitely less than I thought it would be so that means my dad must not be he's definitely my dad but he must not be as Italian as he thinks he is maybe and then 24.9% French and German hot are you kidding 24.9% French and German so you're as German or French as you are yeah yeah I mean so so I mean I'm I'm more French and German than I am British yep so what how much your 11.1% British no really Wow that's like that's I'm almost you that's crazy and then you have 1.2% Western Asian and North African oh yeah okay well the samurais my life has been a lie culturally I couldn't really be any more British so that's a bit of a shock to me I had no idea they were so much French and German in my ancestry I don't really really know what I mean I guess that's just because lots of British people will have French and German they don't know about but yeah that's really interesting so humans are actually 99.5% identical it's that 0.5% that provides us with this genetic diversity with regards to your results we've had adoptees that have no clue what their ancestry is and then are able to see a reflection of you know multiple continents within their results but we see that happen quite often you know people don't realize that you know people migrated from different areas to places that are nearby and just because you were born in a specific country doesn't necessarily mean that your DNA comes from there
0,I feel like I aged just like 30 years so now I'm gonna adopt who may or may not be able to eat meat would teenagers traditionally grind down their canine teeth in a ritual called Missoni it's supposed to spiritually break us from our animalistic instincts and ancestors when we complete this ritual were officially an adult and a lot to have sex and marry today is the last day of my grandmother's funeral which means it's my turn to cut spiritual ties with her and be somewhere in height we're in hideaway until we get called up to go do our tooth filing and by then we'll be an adult according to Bonnie spiritual spirituality you'd already come to mind secondary - yeah it's about control yourself yeah anger control your anger your jealousy maybe had enough why'd you punch buggy on Japan ham - okay that the supreme Kevin Cassini harness not the to do the 2000 at 11:00 and now they're saying you have to get ready in 15 minutes and I think there's so many events that are happening and there's a lot of community miscommunication and communication between the higher the priests and the people drama already in the meantime traditional priests we call them Sangha are busy prepping the tools each one has its own specific purpose will be never come back they're too young a lanky Kotaku knock on window give me a hypnotist and Agena deportability die - opposite - you need it up then you also sing either evil force to sing that becomes an immunity and the Commission like it is a partner the rebalance need we will open our eyes did you get millenia pathology 2018 fashionable I hope care Morgan number in my keys and no friends no aesthetic now I'm on my way to the ceremony I know I've said this before but I really feel like a Korean a spoiled overly dressed one who's too good to step on the dirty ground my dad told me not to close my eyes he joked that in the past people were poisoned when they opened their mouth so you have to watch out for the haters while you're shining I was warned not to smile except in the mirror to avoid being cursed the minute you lay down like you really feel when it's like such a serious ceremony because it's like when I'm gonna get back to you now that they're done with the PM skew my sisters are next we might have faked our smiles for this picture but if you see my parents their joy couldn't be more real maybe it's because Masanga is believed to be a generational ritual and the final duty parents will carry out for their children also Hasani probably has more to do with family pride than self-discovery judging by how many group photos I was for sitting any minute there's a lunch break now and I'm gonna test them on youtubes on this piece of Sunday something bothering me Lamia with my new thing so now I'm an adult who can't who may or may not be able to eat meat and buy property Chris might still taste the same but am I as capable at life does this lost my Franks I've been asking myself what being an adult really means in Bali I don't know if I feel like an adult maybe maybe I'll never feel like maybe I'll get there someday somehow but right now I think an adult for a lot of people it's like fulfilling the parents wants and needs the community wants engaged which is like like I didn't have class like what's next what's next - like are you waiting for my wedding is that what I think I see this experience in this traditions is something that I fully respect a lot of outsiders have been stuck in this perspective of what Valley means I think I'm reclaiming the culture by kind of being Balinese without having prior without being affected by the fire of use of what Bali if I don't think the Balinese are doing of this culture because of the white gaze I think the more the white days happened the more they're seeing it as an opportunity to continue their culture but in the end none of that really matters this is still my roots and what made me thought that would be cool enough for the only one that wouldn't like it let's see if I kept is so I'm gonna do a curse yeah but the gutter curse you
0,"- Okay. Well, give me one accent. - Give you an accent? If you want the African accent, I can say anything you want. (laughs) (lighthearted music) One of the big assumptions
 people make about me is they see my hair and they think, oh, look at this pothead over here, or something like that. I use wreck on very few occasions. But I'm not a pothead,
 I'm not a wake and baker. I'm using it for medical purposes and when it's time to have a good time. - The assumptions that usually people make of me is that I'm airhead. I actually have a degree in accountancy and I have an associated degree in acting. So I'm a hard worker. And check my high school
 records, I got all As. There's no way I'm an airhead. (upbeat music) (fast paced music) Your name is Mark. And this is your story. You are 29 years old. For work, you are a business entrepreneur. You grew up in California. (chuckles) And your cultural or
 ethnic background is white. - My name is Joshua. I'm 33 years old. I work as freelance graphic
 designer and photographer. I grew up in Rhode Island. And my cultural ethnic
 background is white. (ding)
 (laughs) Your name is Toni with an I. And this is your story. You're 25 years old. You work in marketing
 for like, a start up. You grew up in SoCal. And you're African American
 decent, probably a Caribbean. - My name is Bonnie. - With an I? - Yes, with IE. - Okay.
 - E at the end, yes. (laughs) I am 27 years old. For work, I am a fashion
 business entrepreneur. I grew up in South Africa. And my cultural and ethnic
 background is African. I wanna say African American,
 but, but African, yeah. Why would you think my
 name was Toni with an I? (laughs) - I don't know, I don't know. Maybe it was like a shorter name but kinda something a little
 more unique, you know. I like creative people. But people that are
 creative in their own way. Like, you can be an accountant, you can be a lawyer and you can be really
 creative in what you do. I really appreciate extroverted people that are really excited to
 like, dig in and ask questions and like, get to know
 the people around them and environment around them. - In a guy, I'm looking for
 someone who's adventurous. Someone who likes to
 live life to the fullest and likes to explore. And someone who's loyal, obviously. (chuckles) (upbeat music) If you were given a ticket to fly anywhere in the world,
 you would go to Australia. You think it is not okay
 to make occasional jokes based on cultural stereotypes. And your favorite accent to impersonate would be anyone British. - If I could go anywhere,
 I'd go straight to Japan. I think it's awesome to
 make occasional jokes on cultural stereotypes, 'cause it's things that totally define who we are from each other. But they have to be done with tact and well and there are times where it is not at all appropriate. But i appreciate a good joke, always. And my favorite accent to
 impersonate it the African accent. - Mm, okay. Well give me one accent. - Give you an accent? If you want the African accent I can say anything you want. (laughs) I can say, we can go get
 some chicken, you and me. It would be absolutely delicious. I'll pay, don't you worry. (laughing) It wasn't... - Not the best. - It's not best, but you know, I could help you with that. - Yeah, yeah, okay. If you were given a ticket to fly anywhere in the
 world, you'd go to Fiji. You think it's inappropriate to make occasional jokes based
 on cultural stereotypes, but you you laugh really hard
 when they're good and witty. So you can appreciate them. And your favorite accent to impersonate is the Californian accent. - Hm. If I was given any ticket to fly anywhere it would have to be Japan. - Japan. - Yeah. I love the culture there. It looks like a trip and a half. So I would be very excited if I were to fly there. I think it's not okay
 to make occasional... You're right about that. I do laugh at a lot of it's really funny. So, you were right about that, dead on. (laughs) and my favorite accent to impersonate, yeah, it is kinda the valley girl thing. That's the first thing that I got into. - Yeah. - Oh, my God, I want ice cream. Like, I like that flavor, that vanilla is not that great. I love chocolate, chocolate. (laughing) Yeah. It's tiring to do it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (fast paced music) Long term goal for a partner with me would definitely be able
 to be a power couple. I love that idea of like, having a nice house, some property, where friends can come and
 just give them the key. So to have the capital and the creativity to make that the beautiful,
 comfortable space, I would love to have a
 partner to share that with. - I have a small little fashion
 business with my brother. We do tie dye shirts, tie dye skirts, tie dye dresses, just little
 fun, cute stuff for summer. Because mostly in South Africa December is a time for
 summer and to show some skin, so we a little small little
 business that we do together. (upbeat music) - A good salary for a couple in the U.S., you got some class to you, you got some real class
 to you, so I wrote 350K. I think that you think that women and men should both be the breadwinners, was what I wrote. I circled them both. You would consult your partner about financial decisions over $1,600. - A good salary for a couple in the U.S., that was a good amount, actually. That was a really good amount. I says like, 20 grand a month from each of us. - Mm-hm. - If we could like, both
 make 20 grand a month, amounts to the same, I think. - Together, together? - Each!
 - Each? - Yeah, each.
 - Each. You make 20 grand, I make 20 grand. - Yep, so that's like 480. - Pretty much. - Yeah. That is a nice... - Yeah, I definitely think both woman and man should be the breadwinner. (ding) Especially if we think of having kids. You would consult with her partner about financial decisions, I
 would say over 10 grand. - 10 grand.
 - Yeah. - Okay. How did you arrive at $20,000, basically you're saying half
 a million dollars a year. - I thought to myself, okay,
 what is the number for me, just individually without
 anyone to make per month? I would be like 20 at basic. That should be like, the
 amount gat gets in, 20 grand. And then after that, if I
 make more, great, wonderful. So if I'm gonna make 20 grand,
 you're gonna make 20 grand. (laughs) - Okay, alright. - If not, I'll help you. (laughs) We can help each other. A good salary for a couple in the U.S. would be $20,000 each. You think both should the breadwinner. Both man and woman. You would consult with your partner about financial decisions over 10 grand. - A good salary for a couple in the U.S., I wrote the same for you, but it's also what I feel. I thought 350k was like,
 that's a nice lifestyle. And that's well above the
 lifestyle that I grew up living. - Right.
 - For sure. I think men and women should totally have the opportunity to be both breadwinners. But if one is more than the other, and the lifestyle is reached with one of them having more
 financial success than the other, I don't see anything wrong with it. I would consult with a partner about financial decisions over $5,000. - Let me ask you, you know, about the whole bread winning thing. I agree with you, actually. But I also believe that when two people are in a relationship they should also push
 each other to be better. - Absolutely. - But if one is making more I would want that one to help the other, or like, help them find a way to generate as much
 money as they would want. You know, just help them out. - I would say I agree with you that you gotta help each other out, but if, let's say example is, I become that director,
 I get a blockbuster hit, millions of dollars. You have a job where
 you're generally pulling in a quarter million dollars a year. And then you say, I wanna be a painter. Maybe there's money in
 that, maybe there's not, but I'd love a space to create. If the finances are there
 and that is truly your dream, I would hope that it would
 be more than, go paint, but like, yeah, build your studio and your workshop and whatever that is to the best you can. But support isn't always the money thing. - Yeah, no. That's actually what I meant in a way. But, yeah. - Cool. - Alright. (upbeat music) - When we first met I thought, yeah, I'd totally love to date you. (suspenseful music) But, after talking to you, and hearing more than a few things I'd definitely still love to date you. - When I first saw you I
 said, yes, I would date you. But, after like talking to you, I still decided that I will date you. (upbeat music)
 (laughs) - Hooray! - I would love to date you. (chuckles) - First date, sushi? - Right, right.
 - Yeah? - Let's have some sushi and go to Japan. Fly over to Japan. (laughs) - Cool. - Alrighty. - Can I have a hug? - Yeah, let's have a hug. - Thanks. - Let's go to Japan! - Yeah! (chuckles) ♫ Soulpancake (upbeat music)"

 minute intro y'all but this is a crazy journey and before we even get in this
 bag an earthquake just hit Los Angeles actually San Bernardino County while we
 were about to click play and start this video as 6.6 earthquake hit
 so it's 4th of July by the way we've been filming this video all week our
 house was moving everything was shaking I was like ok Christian I'm traumatized
 ok well let's pray another earthquake does not happen and if it does I guess
 won't get it on camera ok so I guess there's only one thing to do is try this
 drugstore makeup alright after a week of agony we finally have the super drug and
 the boots makeup oh my god I'm just oh there is so much stuff here so we're
 just gonna pull it all out I'm just gonna line it up and we're just gonna
 try to do as much as we can to create a little full face and I don't know what
 is about to happen I'm like the journey to get here is very insane so let's see
 if we have a primer to cure my anxiety all right everybody what is about to
 happen I got my receipts here and this primer let's start off with the primer
 you guys it is from a brand called gosh and of course I've never seen this
 before until I went over there this primer is $14.99 and it is a Velvet
 Touch foundation primer just from looking at it almost looks like the
 Smashbox one maybe it's poor filling but let's see what happens oh my god
 literally feels like the Smashbox kind of like ok okay that felt very kind of like
 slippery I think it's in my pores let me do a little look I'm like okay pores are
 a little minimal not too crazy no I really need some foundation because it's
 been a long week and um I've been dying to try this so I got two brands I don't
 know what I'm gonna try I wish I could do a poll right now but there's a brand
 this actually used to be in Sephora this brand is called bourgeoisie and they're
 from Paris this is the healthy mix anti fatigue foundation now it's supposed to
 be 16 hour where there's vitamins in here what does that really mean let's
 give it a whirl so I have a damp Beauty sponge we had a foundation brush and
 let's see what happens now this says flawless fresh and a healthy looking
 complexion up to 24-hour hydration yeah we will not be wearing this for 24 hours
 oh okay so that's what it looks like I'm just gonna take my morphe Jeffrey star
 foundation brush and let's just do a tiny bit and see what happens
 how is the coverage is just a good match I try to buy as many shades as possible
 to try to match myself but you guys know how it is in the store sometimes you
 just got to try it at home and see what happens okay
 from blending it in and easy more light to medium coverage but you guys know I'm
 not mad about that we're all into layering but look at this making my
 discoloration and vanish look at that one more comp all right looking in the monitor and in
 the mirror it is definitely way lighter than I'm used to but I'm not mad at it
 it definitely gives you that kind of like healthy looking glow right there
 you see it on the brow bone obviously I'm gonna do the sponge on the other
 side but look at the difference I'm like wow hmm oh by the way you guys this
 foundation is only eight dollars and forty nine cents I'm like Jesus lower
 that's not bad at all you know it's crazy though I know if I
 try it with a sponge is just gonna look even more sheared out so this is
 actually cute it's really pretty but there's another foundation sitting
 here that is really piquing my interest because it is the all night long full
 coverage foundation from a UK brand called Barry M now you may be like why
 have I heard of Barry M before well mamma Mitchell has been on my channel of
 course several times my amazing friend an extraordinary makeup artist from the
 UK and he has used the Barry M concealer on me once or twice this little guy
 right here and I really loved it at first we pulled it out I was like what
 the hell is this so they have a foundation I've never
 tried it the shade is not my color bitch but I bought a bunch of shade and I
 really want to try it so let's give it a whirl this foundation is only $7.99 and
 the concealer $4.99 I'm like you better work okay let's give this a whirl so
 this is allegedly going to cover everything up into the early hours
 smooth creamy easy to blend feels lightweight moisturizing vitamin E
 antioxidant okay now see what happens should we just go
 in with no shade matching like let's see how good I am at matching this in the
 store if it's a flop you all can laugh at me together okay oh hello coverage goodbye discoloration
 mmm I like how this one smells more than the other one
 to be honest the other one wasn't a bad fragrance this one just kind of smells a
 little more like mm-hmm okay now for fun hmm let's go in with the sponge and
 blend this out okay this is blended out look at my mess over here um let's talk
 about you guys so this side was the bourgeoisie and then over here we have
 the berry and I don't know what to think yet I really like how the berry em side
 looks over here it's definitely little bit more glowy it's a little bit more
 kind of like cakey around my nose area it still looks pretty everywhere else
 but it just kind of sat weird right there this side is looking a little
 better I'm ready for the barium concealer oh I've been trying to open
 this concealer for five minutes you guys when you have nails who else I'm over
 here like I'm gonna stab my eye out all right let's try this
 full-coverage berry and concealer it's called all night long
 it's $4.99 it looks like this packaging is very simple there is five milliliters
 in here and no fragrance really got it okay cool
 let's see if it's gonna cover what I need it to cover no I chose the lightest
 shade you guys there was like 12 to 20 shades I just grabbed the three lightest
 so it goes on light I remember Mitchell like layering this on me and I was like
 oh bitch okay like you really laid it down so let me just try one side let's
 see what happens so we don't go overboard actually I'm impressed you can really
 see of course with my vanity tattoo how well it covers of course we're using the
 morphe beauty sponge so it will sure how it I need bit but I really like it I
 think it needs a little bit more and Wow bitch is impressed with this formula Wow
 okay as I'm blending out the other side I did my chin in the nose this is a
 really nice formula for the price I'm like bitch if you live in the UK you
 better be snatching this up because it's hydrating it looks really pretty and it
 isn't cakey like I know right away when I use a concealer I'm like okay bitch I
 was gonna look - to sleep in my eyes this formula is beautiful
 alright concealer is late now I did not find any setting powder that I could not
 buy in America so we're gonna go in with the iconic magic star of course setting
 powder in translucent and Rose I love combining these they're so good and if
 you want to set your life in a place bitch you know mama has you covered so
 let me just do a quick little set and I will be right back okay face is looking
 really cute now we have a powder foundation anti-fatigue again from
 bourgeoisie this is supposed to I'm just gonna set everything and give an extra
 boost so let's go back in with the same powder brush and look that color looks a
 little dead looks a little grey okay look at that brush hair my face
 okay let me just try this a little bit is it doing anything I'm like packing it
 on and I'm not really seeing anything okay maybe it's just lightly setting
 everything don't really see much of a difference um
 let's move on all right now there is no contour kits that I could find there is
 this little highlighting palette from gosh oh hello there um okay we'll give
 her a little whirl we also of course you guys revolution

 not too mad at that doesn't have any pigment that were pay off oh there we go
 a little bit I was over here I was like mmm

 little sprinkle moment oh I'm not mad at her oh wow how much oh my god this was
 for four dollars literally four dollars well cute I get it

 this one is about line ding I remember this shade being like otherworldly let's
 see if it still does the job oh yes I love this formula it looks really wet
 looking as well yeah whoa okay Wow no I found these eyeliners and I kind of want
 to either use it as an ice pick for someone's eye or I don't know maybe some
 wants to sit on one of these but these are for a revolution fantasy eyeliner I
 can't imagine me like swiping this across my lid and living for it so I
 will definitely swatch these for fun oh wow mmm
 easy that formula I'm not so sure about that one okay well next so for the first
 time in the history of my channel I did not find a really sick eyes shadow
 palette you guys are probably like what are you out of your mind I know but
 don't worry I'll be back there in a few months but I just want to do a really
 simple easy look like mascara lip face fresh BAM so that is exactly what we're
 gonna do today this is basically like products you can really get ready with
 in 20 minutes now mascara there was a lot of mascara in that country Lord we
 have revolutions the mascara the gloss okay bitch the mascara and then we added
 bourgeoisie eye-catching eye opening vol so these are cheap like they are
 really cheap so one of them is only ten dollars and one of them is eight you
 better work okay let's try the mascara look at that brush so much product is on
 there hmm it smells like normal mascara but clumpy Jesus yeah the stopper is in
 there I was looking like oh my god I just look at all that products coming
 off oh okay let's give it a whirl it's like this is
 called Willy clumpy I'm scared hmm
 okay actually not that bad look at that already clumpy the house
 this is like for bottom mascara ooh I'm being really delicate all right now when you look at the
 before and after really cute but it took a second to get there wait longer than
 normal the wand girl this right here held away too much product so I had to
 be so delicate that I didn't bump under my eye let's try the bourgeoisie eye
 catching what does this look like Oh way different and the product is not
 everywhere so let's see what happens okay you know what's crazy this one is
 more like full it gives you more volume whereas this one is like queue but it's
 not giving me the same effect definitely not living for this side I'll be honest
 what's new I know I actually like this like more that it's so crazy the
 applicator was a flop obviously it got it on there it was just so but this it's
 alright it's cute I'm just not living for it it's not giving me really what I
 need the bottom one kind of that's alright but uh okay I would love to even
 take it there with more lashes and then really you guys we have a lip left
 because the drugstore was not popping over there but actually so far so good
 my face is feeling really nice and fresh I would love to put on a lash and you
 guys know I was of course it just overseas with Mitchell and Tati lashes
 who presented and hosted our entire tour and we had so much fun but Mitchell BAM
 he just released new lashes with Tati this is his collaboration I am so proud
 of him he did a collab with them last year it got really big and this is a
 uk-based brand and they are so amazing we had the best time so thank you talk
 to you for hosting our classes now these are massive if you love a crazy full
 lash Mitchell has you covered but for today I am gonna take out that glue and
 I am gonna use it hi magic trick today as well but Tati
 has so many amazing other styles of lashes and this TL 3 is a very hot
 seller so let's try them on alright I've cut the band and now I'm
 gonna put this lash glue on here now Mitchell use this
 every day on me in the classes and these lashes like his new ones the TL choose
 every drag queens fantasy I like to kind of get the base down and I'll go in with
 tweezers everybody hi if you have long nails you know tweezers are our best
 friends and just start laying the lash down oh I love how fool these are
 especially with like no eye shadow it's like giving me everything I need hi all
 right lashes are on oh I love these because now I love supporting indie
 brands and indie companies so if you want to support Mitchel and talk to you
 lashes I will link their site down below okay I think it's time for a nappy now
 there's a lot of stuff here at bourgeoisie again had lip products they
 had a lot of really pretty nudes liquid lips not the iconic driver store
 cosmetics liquid lip formula but hey you never know this might be sickening also
 there is a crazy 3d gloss from bourgeoisie they just had a huge retail
 space so I grabbed a bunch of it and then we have a lip oil from gosh and
 then a holographic lip topper from Barry M so there's a lot going on here let's
 try it liquid lip and we'll put a topper over it let's do this one yeah okay now
 this shade is called velvet number 31 no it's cold flora beige got it really
 doesn't have a fragrance not bad I mean I don't know I'm like I expected
 something wild basic the color looks cute very safe formulas
 all right now what I'm gauging from this formula
 is that it isn't like a long lasting liquid lip because it does say velvet on
 here I think it's just like literally liquid lipstick without the staying
 power but we'll try it in a second all right I'm gonna have Nate see if this is
 a long-lasting formula or a basic ass hey dude over here thank you and look in
 the camera it's on your mouth pretty color it's just not long-lasting which
 I'm not mad about man hey looks forgot our luggage back yeah okay let's quickly
 try on this berry M holographic lip topper of course it's in this crazy
 packaging that I can't open Nate come back all right Nate got the packaging
 off for me now this made in Taiwan work okay let's see what happens with this
 one what does it smell like whoa it smells
 like candy like oh my god it smells so good love that okay I'm not getting a holographic and I
 thought it was gonna be way more blinding and I'm kind of falling flat
 right now and it's removing the lip obviously it's lip gloss but when you
 mmm you guys are talking about this is not
 always happening okay not living for that one let's go in with you
 bourgeoisie 3d effect gloss and shine elixir please work bitch oh oh we may
 have a winner hmm or the brush is so easy hmm let's do
 one more dunk okay
 way better I love this hmm that's all that great but the other one this one's
 not so good um besides that you guys I'd only found a illuminating finish spray
 from Barry M for makeup setting and body spray I didn't find anything else this
 one is supposed to be City proofs they are see is protected from dirt and
 pollution I think it's only fair to set this space and give it a whirl girl let
 me get my Patricof fan bitch and this look is complete all right we finally
 got to finish and complete a little full face of a drugstore at UK and makeup now
 I love this this is like my kind of everyday wearable makeup lashes gloss
 high extreme foundation and concealer so if you're someone that loves an everyday
 moment like this girl there are some gems so all the stuff that is not
 jeffree star approved we're just not gonna mention any more bye you're in the
 graveyard we'll see you later girl now everything that I really loved I'm gonna
 mention I do want to know though you guys ready for this
 Christian let's zoom in right here on my nose now right here of course this was
 the bourgeoisie side now there's some cracking right here not I mean it's cute
 it looks good I have good skin so a lot of foundations will wear out nice but
 we're doing all of that no ma'am and then when you go on this
 side like barium foundation honey it looks really pretty Wow
 okay now besides that the barium concealer I really like that as well
 so the all night long foundation girl it was like a little watery when it was out
 of the component but it laid so nice the concealer this combo they did something
 right high work I loved it besides that this random ex1 blusher I don't know
 where you came from girl I remember grabbing you in one of the stores and it
 was really pretty I'm gonna keep this on my station and use it
 we know sleek is this shit we live for them miss lip color I thought was really
 pretty not my favorite liquid lip formula so
 actually I am gonna just kind of go over that this last almost step this gloss is
 so beautiful and the only other thing obviously is lashes I think they kind of
 stole the show - the concealer I really love them they just make me feel like a
 little doll and I love it okay you guys it was a journey to get here excuse a
 long video I had no idea all of that was going to transpire all I wanted to do
 was try some makeup as usual let me know what you guys think about every single
 product down below what did you hate on me what did you love sound off I want to
 hear from you guys and thank you for watching another review I took a few
 weeks off because traveling has been really extreme so I've officially back
 on YouTube and I'll see you guys in a few days mwah bye guys"
0,it is so fun to be at TEDx so I want your participation in this talk because I believe that the things that we're going to share together now may end up changing your life and maybe even save it one day so first how many of you have ever noticed that you only really start to value things in your life when you're faced with them being gone there's a funny quote that says most of us use our lives spending money we don't have to buy things we don't need to impress people we don't even like so what is wisdom one definition as a University researcher and its current CEO of an organization called wisdom of the world I've seen a lot of definitions of wisdom one that I really like is this wisdom is learning to value the things you have while you have them so most of my life I haven't done this I've wanted things that I don't have I wanted to be someone that I'm not so there's a lot of suffering then I met this master healer from the Himalayas who initially I was a very skeptical of but he introduced me to an ancient science that totally transformed my capacity to value my life and the things in it I want to share with you three experiences early on with him I think can benefit you and then with three questions I want you to answer that I think can change your life forever so a first experience how many of you have had an experience where you've been with someone that you love and they've been struggling with some challenge or problem some pain you wanted to help them and you didn't know how so for me that was my dad I remember the day that he called me on the phone and said he needed to meet in his office I knew something was wrong when I went to his office I sat in the chair in front of his desk and he sat in the chair to the side looking at the floor in silence for what seemed like a long time finally when he lifted as a highest he looked at me and said Clint I haven't told your mother and I haven't told your brothers or sisters but I don't even know if I'm gonna live through this week and I just want someone to know where the loose ends are so your mother doesn't have to worry about it I remember that feeling like life punched me in the gut anything else that was important just faded away and I said what's happening he told me that he had been seen for very competent caring doctors on twelve medications but that too the same month said we don't know what else to do to help you basically in desperation I told him that through wisdom of the world I had met this master healer from the Himalayas that claims that just from touching your posts I don't know how it works that he can know what's happening in your body and then what's wrong and how to help you that his name is dr. Pankaj Narang he's helped people like Mother Teresa the Dalai Lama that the secrets the ancient healing secrets are recorded on these Sanskrit Scrolls in ancient texts have been passed down master to student for thousands of years each of the Masters living well over a hundred well I might as well have been speaking a foreign language because my dad did not look interested and I don't blame him it was so outside my own realm of reality that I didn't see how this was possible but I was desperate so I pushed the issue I said for Father's Day I'm flying you to see this master healer my dad forced a smile for me and said well at least it can't hurt well I remember when he got off the plane he was walking in so much pain he had to have someone on each side carrying him we got to the location at the time dr. Nam was traveling around Europe and u.s. and Canada it was packed full of people more than 50 60 people already there and we're seeing people go in and out in minutes my dad's looking at his list of medications and saying I can't even read it in that amount of time why are we here and I remember when his name was called watching him very slowly walk hunched over in pain suffering and go in the door and it shut behind him I waited very anxiously on the other side when the door opened again minutes later I saw him walking straighter and it was different looking at the eyes I said dad what happened is I don't know how to explain it I didn't tell him anything but he just felt my wrist and in seconds he started telling me what my problem was he says even with my four doctors were in the same room which never happens I don't think they could have described as accurately what's happening in my body and my mind and my emotions well after this initial experience with my dad I became very interested and what is this ancient science I began studying and I came across during this time a brilliant German professor professor from Germany by the name of dr. Ludwig max Fisher who spent years of his life studying distinctions between Western medicine and lots of these forms of ancient healing just one of the points he shares is that in the West we often focus on everything like it's a fight we want to fight cancer fight bacteria we want to kill the pain he says but in the ancient healing they look at things in terms of balance and purification the way doctrine ROM explained it to me is this he says in your body is a microcosm of the macrocosm all the elements that exist in nature also exist in you so when he feels your post he knows the Vata or wind energy pizza or fire energy and kapha or water and earth energy based on which one jumps the strongest and the pattern of the jump and he knows where's the imbalance where's the blocks and then can predict with astounding accuracy the problems that you're facing physically mentally and emotionally well my dad then they have six instruments basically in this ancient science how to help you remove the blocks and rebalance your system one of them is just knowing what to eat and what not to eat second is because it's deep healing it's not superficial pushing down symptoms sometimes it requires discipline and patience and a lifestyle change third is home remedies from your own kitchen or herbs from the earth panchakarma hasta Karma if you haven't heard of it look it up on Google then marma understanding what of the subtle energy points in the body that when you press them remove blocks and help rebalance the system well my dad discipline himself changed his diet took herbs we never heard of before six months later we were sitting in the same chairs he told me now he had a very big problem I said what this time he says I don't know what to do with all these meditations in six months he'd gone from 12 medications to one no more diabetes cholesterol blood pressure no more CPAP machine sleeping pills he had so much no pain in his whole body so much energy he wanted to complete his 30 plus years of work and writing a book on how to help kids make good choices remember that in height just kneeling next to my bed thank you Cobb so when I went to this master healer the second experience I want to share with you I went to thank him I said I feel like you've given me a gift worth more than any amount of money more people should know this ancient science exists they may not choose it but they should know it's a choice he laughed he said you know I need help but not from you I said why not he said your mind is way too crowded so he advised me to do two things one of them was go for a period of silence so for you here or watching this video what's the longest period of time you've gone since you were born until now without talking maybe a couple hours half a day whole day he made me go for ten days of silence one of the most difficult things I've ever done and also one of the most rewarding first time in my life I started to see who I was second I saw so many things I was doing that I thought were important we're just games invented by other people I have a PhD but I saw a university was just invented then you play this game you get this degree money his imaginary was just invented also countries there's when you look from space at the earth there's no line between Canada and the US or Pakistan and India the concept I'm a citizen was just invented so in the silence I thought all the games were playing on earth what else can we invent now that's healthier for ourselves in this planet I went to this master healer and I said I thought I came for healing for my dad I didn't know how much I needed and he let me start traveling with him for the last seven years I've been with him in more than 150 cities all over the world started documenting stories like my father now more than 4500 and what they did in the process I became exposed to what is this ancient science I forgot to show the picture of my dad that's already important dr. Nam told me that in this ancient science everything is a medicine or poison depending on how to use it early on in my traveling I had a headache so bad at the clinic in India he saw 350 people that day my headache was getting worse I was feeling worse so I came to him he knew instantly my imbalance was kapha he says your medicine is onion rings I am surprised he explained no everything's a medicine or poison depending on how you use it even water is a medicine for more than 180 things in a poison for 18 your life's work can be a medicine or poison depending if it's aligned with your purpose he says onion rings don't use every day like a lifestyle but now in your imbalance for this kind of a headache based on principles you don't yet understand it's your medicine well I was shocked my headache just mmm though it was growing intensity all day melted away I was full of so much energy after that and open-hearted enthusiasm I I came to him and I said how did that work he smile if he looked at me he said you know when when I was younger I was a lot like you I says really how he said I was also messed up and confused he told me that his master gave him three questions that helped him give a lot of clarity and purpose to his life he said the ancient science of Siddha veda isn't just about how to regain health or maintain health it's about how to use your health wisely while you have it he said his master according to his master ninety-five percent of people on the planet don't even know what they want that Siddha veda is the ancient art and science of discovering what you want and achieving it physically mentally or emotionally so these three questions I want to share with you he said first of all you want to press this marble point on your right hand right finger six times it helps remove mental blocks and open up your subconscious then ask these questions first if you knew you couldn't fail you knew you're gonna succeed it whatever you did what would you do or be second if you knew you had a hundred million dollars in the bank what would you do or be and third if you knew you only had six months left to live what would you do or be he said these questions can bring so much clarity and not only that but deep healing my challenge to you is find out your answers to those questions I even encourage you to write them on a sheet of paper I made this one the same size as a hundred dollar bill but whatever your currency is I'm I would make it the same size as your money put it wherever your money is and remember that your answers that these three questions are worth more than any amount of money that instead of spending our money on things we don't need to impress people we don't like why not spend our time which is the most valuable thing that we have with people that we love and doing things that matter so in summary I hope you remember this experience of my father I hope you remember this definition of wisdom to value the things that you have while you have them I hope you spend more time in silence asking who are you why are you even doing what you're doing and third perhaps the most important thing that you can do for yourself and those that you love is ask these three questions share them with others give them that gift of asking these questions too if the answers don't come right away press that Marvel point it helps remove blocks and open your subconscious ask the questions until you find those answers write them down review them every day and I believe that is more of us do this we can like doctrine ROM in this ancient science see seemingly impossible things become possible that your life can be filled with true wisdom and that together we can help create this world to be a healthier and happier place in the Mustang you

we gather this evening in the joy of freedom we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told the story of America it is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true it is the chronicle of brave citizens who never give up on the dream of a better and brighter future and it is the saga of thirteen separate colonies that United to form the most just and virtuous Republic ever conceived on this day two hundred and forty three years ago our founding fathers pledged their lives their fortunes of their sacred honor to declare independence and defend our god-given rights Thomas Jefferson wrote the words that forever changed the course of humanity we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness with a single sheet of parchment and 56 signatures America began the greatest political journey in human history but on that day the Patriots who would determine the ultimate success of the struggle were a hundred miles away in New York there the Continental Army prepared to make it stand commanded by the beloved General George Washington as the delegates debated the declaration in Philadelphia Washington's army watched from Manhattan as a massive British invading fleet loomed dangerously across New York Harbor the British had come to crush the revolution in its infancy Washington's message to his troops laid bare the stakes he wrote the fate of unborn millions will now depend under God on the courage and conduct of this army we have therefore to resolve to conquer or die days later General Washington ordered the declaration read aloud to the troops the assembled soldiers just joined an excited crowd running down Broadway they toppled the statue of King George and melted it into bullets for battle the faraway King would soon learn a timeless lesson about the people of this majestic land Americans love our freedom and no one will ever take it away from us that same American spirit that emboldened our founders has kept us strong throughout our history to this day that spirit runs through the veins of every American patriot it lives on and each and every

the Joint Chiefs of Staff please join me in August of 1790 by requests of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton Congress established a fleet of ten Swift vessels to defend our shores these revenue cutters would fight pirates stop smugglers and safeguard our borders they are the ancestors of our faithful Coast Guard when our ships were seized and sailors kidnapped by foreign powers in 1812 it was a Revenue Cutter the Swift schooner Thomas Jefferson that swept in to capture the first British vessel of the war in 1897 when 265 whalers were trapped in ice and the ice fields of Alaska would closing up courageous officers trekked 1,500 miles through the frozen frontier to rescue the starving men from certain death in 1942 the Coast Guard manned landing craft for invasions in the Pacific when the enemy attacked US Marines from the shores of Guadalcanal Coast Guard single men first last Douglas Munro used his own boat to shield his comrades from pounding gunfire Munro gave His life hundreds of Marines were saved as he lay dying on the deck his final question embodied devotion that sails with every Coast Guardsman did they get off guard famous matchbox lead sir valiantly through every hour of the greatest amphibious invasion in the history of our country one Coxon said the water boiled with bullets like a mud puddle in hail stone but still the Coast Guard brave death to put our boys on Utah and Omaha Beach's is trusted to put service before all coasties plunged from helicopters and barrel through pouring rain and crashing waves to save American lives they secure our borders from drug runners and terrorists in rough seas at high speeds the sharpshooters take out smugglers engines with a single shot they never miss when the red racing stripes of a coast guard vessel break the horizon when their chopper blades pierce the sky those in distress know that the help is on their way and our enemies know their time has come of our water stand semper paratus they are always ready they are the United States Coast Guard representing the Coast Guard today you will soon see an hh-60 jayhawk helicopter based at Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater along with an H age 65 dolphin from Air Station Atlantic City and an HC 144 ocean sentry from Air Station Miami thank you thank you to the Coast Guard what a cold December morning in 1903 a miracle occurred over the dunes of Kitty Hawk North Carolina when two bicycle makers from Ohio defied gravity with a 12 horsepower engine wings made of cotton and just a few dollars in their pockets just six years later America was training its first pilots to take these magnificent machines up and over the field of battle in World War one our fly boys rushed the skies of Europe and aces like Eddie Rickenbacker filled hearts and headlines with tales of daring duels and the clouds general Billy Mitchell saw the promise of this technology and risk court-martial and his quest for independent air force he was proven right when empires across the oceans tried to carve up the world for themselves and America stood in the way we wouldn't let it happen after Pearl Harbor Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle and his Raiders flew b-25 bombers off a carrier deck in the deep Pacific in a daring feat of American resolve and as President Roosevelt said the Nazis built the fortress around Europe but they forgot to put a roof on it so we crushed them all from the air 177 Liberator bombers flew dangerously low through broad daylight without fighter protection to the Nazi war machine at play s t more than 300 Airmen gave their lives to destroy the enemy oil refiners and five pilots were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for their actions in that single raid it was airman Chuck Yeager who first broke the sound barrier it was Airmen like Gus Grissom and Buzz Aldrin who traded their Sabre jets for rockets to the Stars and it is our incredible airmen today who will the most powerful weapon systems on the planet earth for over 65 years no enemy Air Force has managed to kill a single American soldier because the skies belong to the United States of America no enemy has attacked our people without being met by a roar of thunder and the awesome might of those who bid farewell to earth and soar into the wild blue yonder they are the united states air force representing the air force you will soon see beautiful brand-new f-22 Raptors from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia and one magnificent b-2 stealth bomber from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri what a great country in October of 1775 the Continental Congress ordered the construction of two Swift sailing vessels each carrying ten cannons and 80 men to sail eastward our young fleet tested their sea legs against the most powerful Navy the world has ever seen John Paul Jones America's first great naval hero said I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast for I intend to go in harm's way he got his wish many times when his ship was shot into pieces off the coast of England by a British vessel and her four dozen guns when demanded to surrender Jones very famously declared I have not yet begun to fight when our Navy begins fighting they finish the job the war of 1812 Captain James Lawrence fell with his brothers on the USS Chesapeake his dying command gained immortality don't give up the ship in the Battle of Mobile Bay Admiral David Farragut lashed himself to the rigging of his flagship to see beyond the cannon-smoke crying damn the torpedoes full speed ahead in World War two it was aviators launched from the carrier Enterprise Hornet Yorktown who filled the skies of Midway and turned the tide of the Pacific War nobody could beat us nobody could come close on d-day çb engineers came ashore to destroy blockades and barriers making way for the invasion many lost their lives but they took the German defenses with them and our men crushed upon the beaches like a mighty storm from the naval demolition units of World War two erosive force that became famous in that mekong delta they don't want to see our force again the very best of the very best the Navy SEALs deliberate vengeance on the terrorists who planned the September 11th attack on our homeland it was the CEOs who stand ready to bring righteous retribution and mountain jungle desert to those who do us harm America's sailors are not born they are forged by the sea their traditions are rich with the salt and blood of three centuries when Old Glory crests the waves the far insurance every friend and every foe knows that justice sails those waters it sails with the United States Navy representing our great Navy today will be two f-18 Super Hornets from Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia along with two f-35 Lightning from Naval Air Station Lemoore in California so great in November of 1775 the Continental Congress created two battalions of a new kind of warrior one who kept and would protect our ships and sailors and be at home both ashore and the mast with musket in hand their versatility was proven in the war of independence when 234 Continental Marines conducted their first amphibious ray capturing the British supply of gunpowder and cannons at Fort Nassau ever since Marines have fought in every American war their legend has grown and grown and grown with each passing year it was the Marines who won America's first overseas battle vanquishing Barbary pirates on the shores of Tripoli their high stiff collar which shielded them from the Pirates sword earned them the immortal name Leatherneck it was the Marines who after two long days of battle marched through the halls of Montezuma it was the Marines who took heavy casualties to kick the kaisers troops out of Bella wood in World War one earning the title devil dogs and it was the Marines who raised the flag on the black sands of Iwo Jima from the Chosun reservoir to case son from Helmand to Baghdad Marines have struck fear into the hearts of our enemies and put solace into the hearts of our friends Marines always lead the way after the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut which claimed the lives of 241 great US servicemen Marine Sergeant Jeff green Ashton lay in bandages so badly wounded barely alive when the Commandant of the Marine Corps came to visit his hospital sergeant Nash tan had to feel for the generals collar he wanted to feel his four stars he could not see and he could not speak he signaled for pen and paper and with shaking hand he wrote towards Semper Fi semper fidelis always faithful burns in the soul of every marine a sacred promise the Corps has kept since the birth of our country they are the elite masters of air and land and sea on battlefields all across the globe they are the United States Marines reasoning the Marine Corps today will be a brand new vh 92 soon to serve as marine one along with two v-22 Ospreys from the famed HM x1 helicopter squadron at Quantico the night Hawks in June of 1775 the Continental Congress created a unified army out of the revolutionary forces encamped around Boston and New York and named after the great George Washington commander-in-chief the Continental Army suffered a bitter winter of Valley Forge found glory across the waters of the Delaware and seized victory from Cornwallis of Yorktown our army man the it R and the ramparts it took over the airports it did everything it had to do and at Fort McHenry under the Rockets red glare it had nothing but victory and when Dawn came their star-spangled banner waved defiant Antietam and Gettysburg our soldiers gave the last full measure of devotion for the true unity of our nation and the freedom of all Americans an Army sergeant named Alvin York faced an inferno of m/v fire and refused to retreat he said I won't leave I won't stop he shot his rifle 18 times killing 18 of the enemy when they fixed bayonets and charged he killed seven more the entire German machine gun battalion surrendered because of one man Alvin York a generation later the army returned to Europe and embarked upon a great crusade with knives and rifles in hand the Rangers scale the cliffs of Normandy the 101st airborne left into the danger from above illuminated only by enemy flares explosions and burning aircraft they threw back the Nazi Empire with lightning of their own from the terrorists of Sherman tanks and the barrels of the m1 rifle in the darkness of the Battle of the Bulge with Nazis on every side one soldier is reported to have said they've got to surround it again the poor bastards numbered American warriors fought through the bunkers of pork chop hill and held the line of civilization in Korea in the elephant grass of Vietnam the first cavalry made it stand amid a forest consumed inflamed with enemies at every single turn the army brought America's righteous fury down to al-qaeda in Afghanistan and cleared the bloodthirsty killers from their caves they liberated Phylicia and Mosul and helped liberate and obliterate the Isis Caliphate just recently in Syria 100% console Jews have always pointed toward home proclaiming this will defend they live by the Creed of Douglas MacArthur in war there is no substitute for victory they are the greatest soldiers on earth nearly 250 years ago a volunteer army or farmers and shopkeepers blacksmith merchants and militiamen risk life and limb to secure American liberty and self-government this evening we have witnessed the noble might of the Warriors who continue that legacy they guard our birthright with vigilance and fierce devotion to the flag and to our great country now we must go forward as a nation with that same unity of purpose as long as we stay true to our course as long as we remember our great history as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future then there will be nothing that America can not do thank you we will always be the people who defeated a tyrant cross the continent harness science took to the skies and soared into the heavens because we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us to the brave strong the proud and the free we are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny we all share the same heroes the same home the same heart and we are all made by the same Almighty God from the banks of the Chesapeake to the cliffs of California from the humming shores of the Great Lakes to the sand dunes of the Carolinas from the fields of the Heartland to the Everglades of Florida the spirit of American independence will never fade never fail but will reign forever and ever and ever so once more to every citizen throughout our land have a glorious Independence Day have a great fourth of July I want to thank the Army Band the National Park Service the Interior Department the incredible pilots overhead and those who are making possible the amazing fireworks display later this evening now as the band plays the Battle Hymn of the Republic I invite the first lady vice president and mrs. pence to service secretaries and military leaders to join me on stage for one more salute to him"
0,hey Vsauce Michael here if you have a watch or a clock nearby take a look at it's our hand it moves completing a trip all the way around twice a day its motion is too slow to see but try really look at right now watch how far it travels in one second okay one Mississippi done that's it see how far it moved well if this watch was the Milky Way that would be about how far we have traveled in our solar system around our galaxy since the invention of writing since the beginning not of time but of our history it's a very small distance unnoticeable for most of humanity's existence there hasn't been writing physical recordings of events or ideas today of course we have writing and we have many different ways to physically store data we even now have digital ones but before writing was invented all humans had was biological storage memories there was no eiga pedia no phone book no library but what there was was old people of everyone around they've experienced the most heard the most things had the most thoughts even today with all this stuff around the oldest among us remain the libraries of things that physical and digital libraries either don't haven't been or can't yet Chronicle Aeschylus famously said that memory is the mother of wisdom but like all storage formats individuals don't last forever these can be lost we can die these can obsolesce they can still be around but have no way to be played back or read they can be abandoned ignored these can also just wear out just as we can forget or develop dementia dementia involves a decline in cognitive skills used to perform everyday activities 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases are Alzheimer's the disease is associated with the accumulation of plaques and tangles in the brain changes accompanied by damage to brain cells and their death the older a person is the more likely they are to have developed Alzheimer's but Alzheimer's is not a part of normal aging symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include a decrease in the ability to think and remember confusion about time and place new difficulties speaking and writing changes in mood and personality as we fight against other diseases and live longer lives Alzheimer's looms on the horizon as if waiting for us to pass the test of other challenges as a cause of death from 2000 to 2013 many things decreased but Alzheimer's has grown stopping it preventing it postponing its development in our brains long enough that we at least die of something else with our memories is a real goal we can achieve your brain fits inside this thing your skull specifically this part back here called the brain case or the arrow cranium it's a bone fortress protecting an inner sanctuary called the cranial cavity your brain sits right here except it doesn't really sit so much as it swims you see the brain is incredibly fragile soft and gooey model or toy brains tend to be made out of rigid plastic and actual specimens used in dissection tend to be a rubbery because they've been affected by chemicals like formaldehyde but real raw fresh brains right out of someone's brain case are soft like soft tofu holding one like this for too long will leave a lasting and shaped depression for that reason the brain has to float so it doesn't crush itself under its own weight but it doesn't float in water instead it floats in a special liquid your body makes called cerebrospinal fluid now this isn't a whole brain this is just the cerebrum the largest part of the brain it plays a key role in language thought abstract thinking awareness consciousness it thinks it's a pretty big deal literally it's the part of you that does speaking anyway the outside of the cerebrum is called the cortex cortex means bark like tree bark or a ride or a husk if I tear off one of the temporal lobes we can take a closer look at this rind it's painted in maroon here you can see its extent it's only about two to four millimeters thick it's often called grey matter because it appears pinkish yellowish gray in a real brain beneath it is the white matter white because although grey matter contains a lot of cell bodies the white matter contains mainly axons that are myelinated that send messages from grey matter to gray matter locations myelin is a whitish material that insulates electric messages allowing them to move faster and fast they do move signals travel through axons at up to 432 kilometers per hour that's 275 miles per hour about the top speed of the fastest production car in the world you can say this car literally travels at the speed of thought but that's slow compared to the speed of electricity through a conductor which is closer to 50 to 99% the speed of light anyway the brain is very wrinkly and that's because a wrinkled shape allows more cerebral cortex to fit into a smaller container if we could take this entire line all of your cerebral cortex flatten it out it would be well about like this it would be about 2 to 4 millimeters thick and have an area equivalent to a square 50 centimeters by 50 centimeters about 20 by 20 inches obviously you can't fit this shape into this shape unless you crumple it up and now we're getting somewhere when we crumple the brain up we get folds the folds are called gyri Cingular gyrus and the crevices are called sulci singular sulcus about two thirds of your cerebral cortex is buried deep within sulci out of view as for memories well every time you learn something new or memorize something new your brain doesn't gain another wrinkle or anything like that instead memories appear to be more about connections relationships and patterns formed by connected neurons when neurons fire together again and again rehearse their connections and bonds become stronger they become more likely to fire together again to be recalled roughly that might be how memory works and it's a helpful way to think about some interesting phenomena like the fact that it's quite difficult to list off the name of every book you've ever read that's like really difficult but if someone were to just name book titles you could effortlessly tell them whether or not you read the book hearing the title likely excites neuron connections more directly involved with the connections associated with your memory of having read that title than a mere prompt to name some books you've read when brain cells and their connections are damaged blocked compromised or killed memories conveyed and the formation of new memories can be hampered learning how this happens in Alzheimer's isn't just important for those diagnosed but also for all of us interested in memory in one to five percent of Alzheimer's cases genetic differences can be identified but the cause of most cases is still mostly unknown a number of hypotheses and observations exist for example we know that 15% of individuals with Down syndrome who live 40 years or longer develop Alzheimer's disease and 50 to 70 percent of those who live to 60 do down syndrome is caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21 we still have a lot to learn but chromosome 21 is also involved in the plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's within this chromosome are the genetic instructions for the production of a protein called amyloid precursor protein or AP P a P P seems to play a role in neural growth and repair it's found on cells throughout the entire body it's processed by the body in different ways most often an enzyme called alpha secret tastes Cleaves it into SA P P alpha and C 83 less often an enzyme called beta secret ace snips a P P a bit higher up releasing a smaller fragment called s a P P beta a third enzyme can gamma-secretase and cleave AIC DOA leaving p3 if alpha secret tastes active first and beta-amyloid if beta secret tastes acted first the normal function of beta amyloid isn't exactly known yet it may play an important role in healthy brain function but if too much is made or maybe if too little is cleared away too slowly or if the protein folds in the wrong ways fragments can stick together creating oligomers groups of a few pieces say four or five these oligomers can then stick to other oligomers and become larger structures called plaques the effect oligomers and plaques have on brain cells and brain health is being studied oligomers may be more toxic they may allow unregulated ion flow into neurons causing their deaths what we do know is that Alzheimer's disease is associated with these plaques in the brain as well as another protein related anomaly tangles a protein called tau stabilizes microtubules in brain cells like railroad ties holding tracks together the tracks that guide nutrients and other molecules throughout the cell in many neurodegenerative diseases tau proteins become abnormally sticky and tangled with other tau proteins compromising the delivery network we do know some factors associated with increased or decreased risk but their exact relationships with cognitive decline aren't all certain things associated with a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease include physical activity a heart-healthy diet learning a second language later in life being social frequently interacting with people protecting your head and intellectual activities like crossword puzzles playing instruments reading board games education such activities may improve overall brain health and cognitive skills with a brain more resilient to damage should it come whatever the case there's a lot more we can learn it is incredible and exciting and a little scary to realize how much more we have to learn about the brain we know more about the orbital mechanics of distant binary stars than we do about the very mechanisms we use to know about them in the first place inner space is as mysterious and deep as outer space and of course between the two one doesn't even care if we exist while the other well the other is us the wobbly gel in our heads no stiffer than a good booger is fragile and still very much of a scientific frontier it looks like soft meat but it can not only think reason feel remember and lie it can also care for other people and the goopy wrinkled things inside their skulls it can be patient with them see them as people no matter how they change whether by growing up or growing way up supporting research caregivers and those diagnosed is something we can all do so thank you and as always thanks for watching terry pratchett famously said that right now the sword that will defeat Alzheimer's is probably made of gold donations resources for the last few years Vsauce has donated to and supported the Alzheimer's Association they are great people and they helped me a lot with this video I've included links to them in the video's description
0,as you go about the task of trying to understand narcissism one of the things that begins to rise to the surface pretty quickly is I'm dealing with somebody here who is not at all healthy narcissists are troubled Souls they're they're underdeveloped in their conscience they're underdeveloped in the way that they engage with people they're like a little child who hasn't figured out yet that the world doesn't revolve around them now the deeper you go into your understanding of narcissism I'm sure that you can see you know there are other kinds of traits that spin off of that that can seem rather scary and then many people will ask me well yes I can see the narcissistic element here but am I dealing with a sociopath or perhaps am I even dealing with a psychopath and I think it's good for you to know what that's all about because the more you understand what's in front of you then the more you can make informed decisions about where you're going to go in relation to all of that so I want to see if I can break down the distinction between narcissism sociopathy and the psychopath and and as I do so I'm going to give a heading to each of these three categories to try to make it a little easier for you to understand when we talk about narcissism I'm going to use the heading dismissive when we talk about a sociopath I'm going to use the heading schemer and then when we talk about the psychopath I'm going to use the heading predator okay and I think you can already see where we're going with this it actually becomes a continuum with the psychopath all the way down at the far end now you know that with the narcissist we have a very high need for control a very low level of empathy a lot of exploitive and manipulative behavior they must be in charge they must be superior they have an alternate view of reality they can rationalize anything and everything and then when I put it put it under the heading of dismissive then there are certain other elements that we can add to that for example the the narcissist will over you themselves which predictably says then they undervalue you you're just a pond you're just a player on the stage as far as they're concerned and your worth and your value is not something they put much thought into at all other than how they can use you they do have that sense of entitlement there are certain things that I need but then in that dismissive sense it's like and I don't care what you need or they always have to be right well when they're right again going back to the dismissive word well then somebody's going to be wrong and guess who that's going to be they they have a strongly critical mindset and so in their criticism there there just has to be somebody who has to take the brunt of their annoyance and impatience and irritability and again that's going to be you and so basically the the narcissist concludes I'm really glad that I mean and boy what I hate to have to be you and these are people that just it's impossible to deal with them on any kind of long-term basis where you're going to have some satisfaction now let's take it up a notch and let's go to the the category of sociopathy now keep in mind I put the the overall overarching descriptor over that as the schemer associate pass are always cooking up some sort of a scheme let's keep in mind that they operate on the assumption that if there are rules out there those rules don't apply to me and so they see themselves as being above and beyond the standard operating procedures that everybody else has to go with now it could be that inside a business if a business has a certain protocol in terms of how they do things their thinking is but the protocol is going to be different for me because you see I'm way special I'm really smart and I'm a lot better than that or inside a relationship it's like well most people when they do relationships they handle it a B and C but I'm not most people and so they give themselves particularly in title morality is something that just is meaningless to them they may say that they're committed to you but then you find out that there's all sorts of stuff going on behind the scenes whether it's through addictive behaviors or through achieving their and and and being involved with multiple people at the same time rules and morality are just irrelevant to them it's whatever I feel in the moment and so they do not conform in fact they they like the idea that they don't conform and they they like to have toys that are a little bit different they like to have all sorts of activities and adventures that say you know I'm a I'm a pleasure seeker and you're going to see it and you're going to see it very easily around me now another ingredient that goes along with this is no remorse no guilt if you catch them red-handed at doing something they may say something to get themselves off the hook like yeah I guess I shouldn't have done that but at the end it's like it doesn't it doesn't sink down very deep at all if you or I were to do something really wrong I would hope that there would be a sense of agonizing and soul-searching that goes on sociopaths don't agonize sociopaths don't soul search now they can be very intelligent and they can intellectualize all sorts of aspects of life and they can talk as if they understand right from wrong but down at that gut level it's just not there they do and say whatever is expedient in the moment and then whatever accountability you want them to have it's like it's meaningless they wear masks and and they're they're chameleons who live to exploit now one of the things we can say about sociopaths is that they can be very skilled at picking out people that can be duped or picking out people that can be manipulated then because they're slick talkers and they can say whatever needs to be said in the moment and bring you in and and they tend to work pretty quickly and so one of the things that you want to watch for is when somebody tries to get you to join them and / have something that seems a little bit fishy but they say come on it's okay and they work real fast with you because they like pulling people in because then if there's something wrong they have someone that they can blame and it's going to be you now let's go to that place of the psychopath and I mentioned that the word we're going to have there is predator now a psychopath well when you see movies and things on television news and all like that the psychopath tends to have a very strong criminal mind I mean when we say they don't have a conscience they have zero conscience it's like they have no regard whatsoever for order it's completely all about themselves they have no need for compassion they do not attach well at all people are only only tools to be used and so they can be very cold-blooded in the way that they engage with folks they must be dominant they can have a very bad temper and they can be very overwhelming when somebody does something that that displeases them to the extent that they're punishing behavior can be very severe and abusive you are upon to be used by these individuals nothing else so they have a reckless disregard for any kind of order and they have no sense of accountability whatsoever and many times these people can can have such difficulty in engaging in an orderly kind of way that they operate kind of on the fringes and they they don't do well in regular jobs but they they have to have their own way and they just cannot have any kind of sense that says anybody's going to tell them what to do now narcissism the the dismissive person the sociopath the schemer and then the psychopath a psychopath the predator these are three very difficult kinds of categories that we can deal with and and I want you to see that there are some common themes between these all three of these categories operate with the presumption that you you are beneath them there is no sense of equality in the occasion with any of these three you are you exist being exploited you serve a function for them and whatever the function is it's going to be very self-serving and so if you think you're going to gain by being with these people think again because they have no regard for whatever gain you might want and then another common thing between these is there's little to no honesty what you see isn't necessarily at all what's really going on or what's a projection of what's going to happen you're dealing with smoke and mirrors and then another common thing with these is you stick with these people long enough you will be harmed these are not people who have any regard for your sense of well-being and then any pleading that you have for for a better treatment or any plea that you have for them to see their dysfunction is going to be dismissed so it's not a very optimistic kind of thing for us to understand or for us to engage with is it so as we look at these kinds of characteristics in these three categories I think it's going to bring you back to some of your basics asking is this really what I want now it's always fascinating to me when I see people who are drawn to that bad-boy mentality or that wild girl kind of mentality or it's almost as though we glamorized the people that get away with you know breaking laws and all of this and I'm frankly amazed when I watch some of the I don't watch them actually but when I know of movies that glamorize the the mean person that glamorized the people that break all the rules seriously is that really what we as a culture want to to hold up as something that's that's entertaining or that's something that we want to aspire to I hope that you can see through that and realize this this is not at all a way that anyone would want to engage and the scenes there's just much hurt and damage that goes along with it so as you understand these categories I'm hoping that you'll take it as a time for personal reflection looking at what these people are capable of and what their tendencies are I'm hoping you can ask what's my better alternative what what does goodness mean to me and how can I treat people in a way that never leads to the ways that these individuals do and and having this information I want you to be able to take it in a good direction and and ward off your your sense of vulnerability to those who cannot and will not agree with what you understand to be a right approach towards life now I'm hoping that you gain something from the videos that we put up here on our surviving narcissism Network beneath the video you'll see that subscribe button I would invite you to do that and we also have some links for some books and some online videos and I hope that you would take take availability of that I really enjoy doing these and and I like it in the comments from you and I will see you next time around
0,now take a good look  of the injured  but it remains indeed
0,"They billed our insurance company over $3 million for the cost of transplant. Then I have another EOB right after it was it was another $1 million.So you're looking at a $4 million transplant. I don't know what people do without insurance. How could you even begin to pay that? We hear so much about how expensive medical bills are, we've almost become numb to it. In 2017, 1/3 of the money raised on GoFundMe went towards medical campaigns. And the site raises $650,000 a year for more than 250,000 medical campaigns. Luca was born with Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia and Hirschsprung's Disease. At three weeks old, he had surgery to remove part of his colon. At two months, he went into cardiac arrest. And at five months, he had a lung transplant. His parents had to turn to fundraising almost immediately just to keep up with the medical bills. They did a clamshell approach and he has several scars from all of the other surgeries. So when did the U.S. health care system go from a philanthropic program to a multi-billion dollar industry? And where do the funds go once the bills are paid? Today, the U.S. health care system is in a sort of tug of war between physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, shareholders and insurance companies. The list goes on. But for this video we'll just focus on these entities. Caught in the center of it all are the patients. We're often not able to provide the type of care that we want because of the cost of care. Most Those costs are now forcing a growing number of uninsured or underinsured Americans into traveling abroad for medical treatment. Everyone started thinking of health care as a business where the metrics were profit, return on investment, efficiency, and those aren't the metrics of health but that's how we judge hospitals today. You would think that they would be looking out for your chronically ill children and you know all of the medications and and things like parking at the hospital. No. No that's not covered. But before we get to all of this, let's rewind to understand how we got here. This chart is a pretty good place to start. The data shows health care spending versus life expectancy. The rest of the world pretty much stays the same course. But around 1980, the U.S. veers off. I like to say it's kind of the, the road to hell is paved in good intentions because everything we've done was in the name of better health. To be clear, growth in U.S. health care spending has slowed over the past few years but it's still way higher  than in other wealthy countries. Before government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, Blue Cross and Blue Shield were the main providers of health insurance in the U.S. At the time they were nonprofits and accepted everyone who wanted to sign up. But at this point, it wasn't to control costs. It was really insurance in a worst case scenario. And after World War II, employers started offering health insurance. Suddenly demand was booming. From 1940 to 1955, Americans with health insurance went from 10% to more than 60%. That demand created a business opportunity, and for profit companies started rolling in. Insurance was the first sector because it's in some ways the original sin, in the sense of it separated the consumer from payment right. So it felt like nobody was paying. By 1951, Aetna in Cigna were major players in the for profit health insurance market. And in 1965, President Johnson established Medicare and Medicaid. This medical insurance for those over 65 will become effective July 1st. Even so, the for profit insurance market continued to gain steam through the 70s and the 80s, capturing more and more of the health insurance market. Meanwhile the first for profit hospitals started popping up around the country. When Medicare and Medicaid started, there were none. But by 1983, one in seven U.S. hospitals belonged to an investor-owned multi-hospital system. By the 90s, Blue Cross and Blue Shield had merged but they were losing money, fast. And in 1994, they let their local companies turn to Wall Street to stay afloat. Hospitals I think were the first to realize, well we can charge whatever we want for these things because it feels like no one's paying. But then you know there are all these doctors in the hospitals. They see all these business consultants coming in. They see the hospital's CEO making two million dollars a year and they're feeling like wow we're suckers. You know we're working our tails off here, and we want in too. Essentially hospitals went from being run as a philanthropy to being run as a corporation. But these corporations aren't selling just another widget. They're putting a price on human health. The health care industry is now the country's biggest employer. And those employees need to get paid. Throughout all of this is private capital, and lots of it. You would think that if hospitals are becoming more efficient the cost to consumers should go down too. But that hasn't necessarily been the case. And a lot of that has to do with the billing system. Of course doctors need to get paid. There are admin costs and medical supplies and technology. But instead of this three page bill you'd get in Belgium, medical bills in the U.S. look more like this. I am my son's secretary and I spent a lot of time taking care of just just medical bills ,and phone calls, and that type of thing. We talk a lot about the billers and the coders and the consultants who really are removed from health care. They're not there because they care about health, they're there because they see a business opportunity. And you know you can't blame them in the sense that that's what their companies are supposed to do. They're looking for business, so a collection agency that does health care, you know to them a bill is a bill is a bill. They don't care if it's for somebody's heart transplant or someone who was not very judicious and spent a lot more money on a Rolex watch that they couldn't afford. It's a bill. But how come those bills are so long? It has to do with something doctors call unbundling. Think of it like buying a plane ticket. You pay for the ticket itself, but there are a lot of extra charges squeezed into your final bill. $30 for a checked bag. $50 for a few extra inches of leg room and another $3 for water. You get the gist. People get irate about it in an airline ticket but in healthcare we've kind of come to accept it as, oh that's just normal. And part of the reason I wrote the book is to say that's not normal in other countries. Hospitals do this through a complex system of codes. New patient visit: 99201-05. Emergency room visit: 99281-85. Burn due to water skis on fire: V9107. Yeah there really is a code in case your water skis burst into flames, you know, as they do. Different codes mean different prices. Just take the codes for a laceration. You'll be charged a different amount depending on the size of the cut, where it's at on your body and how complex the suture is. Coding historically was about tracking diseases., right. But in the U.S.,  pretty much alone, how you code a patient interaction is a billing construct. Again something that would had scientific and medical purpose gets translated into a business asset. Every day we spend hours going through check boxes, typing notes, documenting things that we're supposed to document for billing purposes, that we really don't think improves patient care. The more that you spend time with computers, the more that we spend time billing, that means a lot less time for face to face interaction with our patients. And that's why most of us got into medicine in the first place. There are benefits to taking down all that data. In theory, it can lead to better results in the long run. Doctors may find things later that they didn't catch in the moment. But at the end of the day, it's just not working in the U.S. Some doctors say they're concerned about malpractice lawsuits, so they order more tests to protect themselves. Bills keep getting longer, and health outcomes aren't always getting better. The American Hospital Association declined to comment on criticisms of the current hospital system. But they do have a fact sheet explaining that hospitals often don't get paid the full amount that the bill. The AHA claims two-thirds of community hospitals lose money when the government pays Medicare and Medicaid bills. And that ""the hospital payment system itself is broken."" And of course a big part of that health care spending is on drugs and supplies, both of which can be hard to get insurance to fully cover. Oh, thank you Luca. Can you show us what's in that box? Are these your ostomy bags? So we get 10 per box and that lasts me about two and a half days. What they're currently charging me is one $1,178 this month for those boxes. Thank you! Let's talk about one of the biggest issues weighing on the pharma industry right now and that is drug prices. From $18 a tablet jumping to $750 a tablet a 4000 percentage just 24 hours. Do you feel badly about what's happening? No in fact we're increasing access to patients, Meg. We've all heard about Martin Shkreli raising the price of Daraprim. But what about Colchicine or Epinephrine? The prices of those drugs have both skyrocketed because one company has control over it. The response is usually the same, the companies need to raise prices to fund the research and development for the next drug. For the most part high priced drugs have patent protection from the government. They pretty much have a monopoly in a market so very often you have someone who needs a specific cancer drug. One company makes it, they're the only company that makes it, no one else can make it. And since it might be absolutely necessary for your life, they're in a position where they could charge anything they want. How is that possible? Well there's not really anyone stopping it. Once people realized you can get away with this stuff it became a race to the top. It's also important to remember that many of these costs are adding up during a very stressful time. Sometimes the people paying the bills aren't even conscious. The analogy I often make is firefighters when they come to a burning house. So when your house is on fire, your family's inside, you don't want to be sitting there negotiating with firefighters. Oh you know I'm going to pay you $300,000 they want $400,000. That's not how you want to do this. And often health care does have that character. Medical emergencies are chaotic. And health insurance is confusing. There are HMOs, PPOs, deductibles, copays and premiums to try and make sense of. You'd think that if people are insured, they shouldn't have to pay that much out of pocket. But that's not always the case. Not every doctor accepts every insurance plan. And some hospitals have staff employed by multiple third party companies. So one trip to the E.R. could get you five different bills and your insurance might only cover one. I actually stopped taking ambulances. Really. We had one really really close call where Luca was pretty unstable. We knew things were going south and we drove him to the hospital instead. I sat in the back and slowly increased the oxygen the entire ride and my husband was driving 120 mpg down 95 because it was faster and cheaper for us to do it that way. When you're being slammed with those type of bills like you just can't incur any extra costs. And I'm a nurse so I figured I was in the backseat and if I had to do chest compressions I was going to do chest compressions. Today nearly 30 million Americans are uninsured. That's down from roughly 55 million in 2010 before the Affordable Care Act. But it's still a higher percentage than countries like France, Japan and Israel. The insurance companies are supposed to be negotiating their prices lower because in a lot of cases they're ultimately the ones footing the bill. But as we've seen over the last few decades, those costs can still get passed onto consumers. Health costs and contribute to all sorts of inequalities in society. So people who are poor or middle class even, they're just one serious illness away from bankruptcy. So where do we go from here? Once there's all this money sloshing around in the system there's this kind of pile on effect where everyone wants to grab their bit of this huge pot of money. And now what we have as we're trying to take it back and reduce costs is everyone is desperately clinging to their piece of the pie. Of course, health care costs have the potential to impact your personal budget if you're paying for insurance or when you get sick. But it also impacts the country's bottom line. The government currently spends more than $1 trillion on health care. And the CBO expects spending on Medicare and Medicaid to double in the next 10 years. That's not just because the population is getting older. A large part of that spending will come from health care getting more expensive. There's no magic solution as to what to do next. But people are at least starting to think about the steps it will take to turn things around. One is having a lot more transparency. Both doctors and patients and their families should have an understanding of roughly what it's going to cost. Alternative route, having some sort of government manufacturing facility so that you could say to Shkreli's: ""OK you want to do that, guess what? Next week, we're going to be on the market and we're going be selling this stuff for a dollar two dollars a pill."" Peekaboo. (laugh) Ready. Peekaboo. There is a very very strong possibility that Luca will need a second lung transplant before he's ten years old. He's already had one and they will list him for a second. And right now the policies in our health care system is they do not list him for a third. So I do not know if I will see my child ever hit his teens or early 20s. It's pretty scary. Like I don't know if I'll ever see him get married. It's just so unknown."
0,did you see that tweet where someone asked me to talk about failure well here I am talking about failure you know I've felt a lot in my life most notably the thing that comes to mind and by god I wish it didn't was my expectations around the success of the film Arthur that I appeared in and then the reality of the film Arthur that I appeared in it didn't do well and afterwards I felt Alyssa rated so that showed me it took a long time to see this that I really wrapped up my sense of self in personal success but I thought that if Arthur is like a number one box office smash then I will be enough I will be validated invaluable I was shown that by attaching my sense of self to that particular endeavor but are we going to suffer now what I've learned through continual failure some that preceded that and some that are come subsequent to it is that the less external things but I rely on the better and that the process of failure is a process of Education of realizing that failure is a situation labeled as a negative situation only by my own desires and it's often not the external situation that needs to change but my attitude towards it I failed in relationships before I failed professionally before I've failed in my expectations of myself and where that's brought me to is a kind of willingness to acknowledge and accept that I don't know what's best for me that's vital in recovery to arrive at the point where you realize that your own vision of reality cannot be a determiner you become teachable when you know that also it's good to know that no external thing will ever be sufficient to make me okay with the world and also it's difficult to understand the effect of you know like when that happened when like Arthur didn't go as well and I'm imagining people in genuine crisis watching this oh you poor man a film didn't do as well as you hoped it would you know like I'm aware of the depth and breadth of suffering that's available I'm aware of the pain that people go through some somewhat because I remember it but mainly because I listen and I'm aware that some people's sense of failure is as a parent because they've lost their children some people's sense of failure is it a husband because they've lost their partner but for me the what is common to all forms of failure wherever it lands on the scale is that the possibility for us to change our perspective was quite a holistic about what I have been taught is being willing to let go of the idea that I know what's best for me and now I realized that because I've been removed from a particular career path due to circumstance a world of possibility has opened up to me because I'm happy with the person I am now I was unhappy in my relationship was I love my children because I love my life because I see the possibility for a beautiful future where I am valuable and of service where I'm truly connected to people things that are regarded as a failure in the past they just seem like the necessary parts of a journey so when you feel like you are failing if you feel like you're failing at work or you feel like you're failing in your marriage I suppose I would invite you to consider that it's possible that you do not yet have all of the information from moment to moment we travel through life with our limited perspective whether that's in the visual field or the field of consciousness we're not capable of understanding the entire sphere of our reality but generally more will be revealed to us and broadly what I think will be revealed to you is that what you have once regarded as failure is a necessary step on your journey to becoming the person you were intended to be hello I'm doing these new videos more frequently now please hit the notification button at the end of this video cuz then you'll get a like a little bell when there I posted a new video and I'd like you to get a little bill when I post the video then I can I don't know be buzzing away in your pocket sounds like I'd be like a little pocket mosquito anyway subscribe click the bell I want more people to watch their YouTube videos you specifically
0,"Queen Elizabeth drives to her coronation at the Queen's coronation in 1953 the aristocracy of the kingdom assembled and at the top of the pile with the Dukes excluding the Royal Dukes titles given to the immediate family of monarchs there were then 28 non Royal Dukes at the sacred moment that the Queen was crowned they were also entitled to don their Coronets and the trumpet sound dukedoms are created by the monarch for reasons ranging from a grateful nation rewarding a major war leader to a king acknowledging his illegitimate son the title then passing down the generations I'm Luca Bethel Microsoft Ali Borden Earl of Strathearn straddle verkan vall widow Balvenie and Gosk Lord Murray Thane of Glen salt and I think I've missed or not but there are a lot of them this is the list of my titles Duke of Montrose Marquess of Montrose Marquess of Graham victory and baron gram of Bellefleur you're always yeah so I'm the Duchess abrupt and the 11th Duchess of Rutland and this is my home beaver castle if I'd been born a boy I would have been my father's heir and the 12th Duke of Leeds as you weren't but I wasn't the crowned queen the last dukedom to be created it was by Queen Victoria in 1889 and it is inconceivable that there will ever be any more so as they gradually become extinct there are now only 24 non Royal Dukes what will become of those that remain do they still have power and wealth what is it to be a Duke in the 21st century dukedoms still owned in excess of 1 million acres of Britain today the classic image of a Dukes stately pile is Blenheim Palace home to the Dukes of Moreh over 300 years the Dukedom was created in 1702 for John Churchill the wily statesman and soldier who won a series of battles against the French his greatest was the Battle of Blenheim until the Second World War Blenheim Palace continued to run pretty much unchanged driving in today is someone who actually lived that Downton Abbey life she was born Lady rosemary Spencer Churchill the daughter of the 10th Duke of Moll bruh no distant car park for her when her father succeeded to the title lady rosemary was a lively five-year-old right should we go wrong here there were no pesky red ropes in those days yes this I recollect very well because there used to be a piano here and we had to practice the piano and there was a dagger under this picture of my grandfather my grandmother and my father and the dagger was there that if there was a far that the pictures could be cut out of their frames very quickly and thrown out of the window but of course this was fascinating for a child instead of playing the piano I used to play with the dagger not sure I think it's still there behind the chair I think if we're allowed to do this but I think there Chisholm see is a huge knife it was just home no you just happen to live here and you didn't think it was really very extraordinary when you were a child how many servants were there in dolls that was 36 I think but they were all the them all really tall my mother would like them to be six foot tall that as the average height of a male in those days is about five foot three different quite difficult to combat but they were all about six foot wide I could say well I mean you know her cyclist she wants a lot of rigidity but sure you know they didn't silver they didn't look right I see everything was almost smart I hate firm shoulders long I don't know why people have to put it on the side would you rearrange it yes I would I just hate things on the small these are the invitations to the coronation in early 1953 lady Rosemarie was selected to become a maid of honor to the Queen not only beauty and France being the daughter of do yes yes yes I had a head start because there weren't any other Dukes daughters no there was there was Marc wish there was Jane Jane de entender stood but otherwise they were mostly girls I think way low you way below I believed one or two people were rather cross and cook tell me that shall be named this somebody was rather cross that her daughter hadn't been asked but from the roaring of the multitude into the quiet solemnity of the great some interesting ah yes there we are we're going into the alley I'm at the back on the right-hand side I've never seen this before me there are left my father would have been there but I don't know quite well did you know not at all did they say they saw you know they obviously did because they wouldn't be them sort of fairly up at the top of the pile so to speak but no I don't think we discussed it really at all do you find that all no I don't think wondered find it or you do find it or did those days cuz you had lots of sort of very grand things that happened all the time yeah I never remember discussing it with my parents at all here we are on the balcony it was amazing the final fee the others I think all went out around London afterwards but I had to get home because my mother was roasting her ox in the park for Woodstock there's none of the carving the Ox I'm there cutting up the meat that world has in some ways disappeared Lady Rose Marie's brother was Duke for 42 years his son succeeded to the title last year but how are the other dukedoms faring Blair Castle is at the center of a vast new cool estate of over a hundred and forty thousand acres in the Scottish Highlands assembling today is the only private army in Europe the Duke of Atholl was given the right to possess such a thing by Queen Victoria in 1844 and today the Ethel Highlanders regiment consists of around a hundred men made up of locals associated in some way with the Duke cooler states its commanding officer lives 6,000 miles away my father actually he had nine tension of sort of accepting the role at all he was going to be a he actually made inquiries official inquiries as to how I could get out of it and the person that he consulted at the Lord Lyon CID you can either come it's a Schedule one offense or felony they call it sir that guy's jail for the rest of your life or die this you can't abdicate in a Duke this is the archive here well this part at the top has the earliest documents there's 40 trunks of land charters giving the Duke title to his estate but the very oldest is in here this one dates from 1180 the next one is from 1199 the main thing was to prove that you owned a bit of land so without a charter from the crown you had no proof and these are the originals absolutely of course family history matters when the 9th Duke died there was a very convoluted route to his successor a young man who was his fourth cousin twice removed we have a very simplified family tree here so you come down straight from the 3rd Duke 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th but they have no mailers so you have to find the next male heir working your way back so this was a brother of the 4th Duke you come down through this line of georgia's until you get to the 10th Duke here the 10th Duke had the perfect dukkha limit as if from central casting he was nearly 6 and a half feet tall talked in clipped sentences ending each with that Victorian era Stoker attic tick what a bachelor he died in 1996 and the whole process of finding the next heir started again and then to get to the present line of jute you don't have to go quite so far back just to the great grandfather of the tense Duke and his brother again and through the male line to the present Duke grace the apple Islanders are formed up and ready for your inspection sir Bruce Murray runs a small sign-making shop that he set up many years ago in an obscure provincial town in South Africa in 2012 Bruce and his second wife Charmaine found themselves becoming the Duke and Duchess of Atholl along with 12 subsidiary titles being the Duke he is automatically the colonel-in-chief of the Ethel Highlanders it's quite a responsibility it's a very very moving experience for me to parade before them and I said to Charmaine the Duchess the other day that I'm so glad that I'm on my own knee because if I had to turn around and and actually have to talk to anybody else I wouldn't be capable of doing it I've got a constant dumping my - I'm on parade you know I'm here because of an accident of birth and I didn't actually do anything to deserve this huge privilege that I have all of this that happens is done for me you know basically and it's just a very overwhelming sensation that I get to feel that I haven't done anything to deserve it the Duke and Duchess only see the family seat on their brief trip over from South Africa once a year this is the entrance hall and it's a collection of firearms and weapons that the Dukes have collected just this morning we were wondering how many of these weapons have actually been used and it's quite sinister but it's a wonderful collection the trouble with grand estates is that if not well-managed they can run out of money in the 1930s the elderly and childless brothers the eighth and then ninth Dukes were facing ruin but luckily their distant cousin the heir to the title was about to marry a woman with a very rich grandmother her grandmother old lady Cowdrey realized that the estates and financial problems and the whole thing would probably be sold so old lady Cowdrey stepped in paid off the bank debt turned the whole thing into a company she had the controlling shares the deal was signed she went to Paris that weekend for a rest and dropped dead my great-grandmother effectively bought the estate and her condition of buying it was that the Duke and everybody continued to live here but her advisers ran it and they took a more businesslike approach and won one aspect of that was opening the castle to visitors so by bringing in capital and a commercial approached the rich old lady had insured for her granddaughter that there would be a suitable estate along with the title the title stays with the male line but the tenth Dukes half sister Sarah is the trustee and she and her mother and her grandmother were the ones with the actual control so the hereditary system does not mean that the male's get the control they might get the title but initial very bothered about the title its running the estate that's more important sarah troughton the head trustee is the half-sister of the 10th Duke what do you think about the title only going through the male line um huge relief I didn't want to be a duchess really yes I date I think it's it's a nice sort of ceremonial thing these days but it's not something I I prefer to get on with the business side of things how do you inherited the title in the past you'd have lived in the castle do you ever think about that when I when I do you think about that I the the prospect of managing and enterprise life is absolutely appalls me so actually the way that it is now I'm probably one of the luckiest Dukes because I have this massive enterprise that's there to allow me to be a Duke well this is a picture staircase showing a lot of my ancestors it's lovely I have this family tree I can no more release what they look like know if I'll see John the 1st marquess of Ethel the chap in a very peculiar outfit and this would be James the 2nd Duke of Ethel no it's obviously a little bit of DNA in there somewhere but I don't think I look like him The Dukes sons the Marquess of Talib a Dean and Lord David Murray are officers in the Ethel Highlanders wash the soldiers there so in a real army so in theory we could sort of gather the men and go to war if you wanted to do you regret you're not in a position to live here it's a very difficult one to answer because obviously I'm African and always will be um but honestly no and I think it's just quite special that we can have the African side as well as the Scottish side so we have the best of both worlds the Duke and his family play a symbolic role in all the rituals the air and the spare pulled down their socks and gets stuck in with the local fun mr. Bennett no longer a strictly military occasion the Duchess accompanies her husband but even at full speed suitable respect is shown to the Duke back home she's simply Charmaine but here she's the Duchess and does what Duchess is do disbanded it's nice to know everybody you were able to enjoy I mean I'm one of 24 people out of 7 billion on the planets have got this responsibility to be a Duke and it's onerous you can't be trying for it in my suggestion obviously if you're born and bred into it it's different that nobody can teach you how to be a Duke this new South African line of long distance Dukes of Atholl came about because the Dukedom can only go through male heirs but when all male heirs run out that is the end of the line well there are some books a couple of books in here so where does that leave kamila Osborne whose father was the Duke of Leeds a dukedom now extinct the other rather grander book which has got the title on the cover and I didn't know which one it was for and that's the family book plate where's the Coronet she lives in a new-build close in southwest London but she still gets odd glimpses of the precedence at some dinner tables the test status as daughter of a Duke can give her you know if I went for lunch at Christie's for example they are extremely aware because they spend their days looking up Dukes and so he counts and everything else said you would also you would be put on the right of the Christie's director I went to electric Christie's and I was on the right and there was a woman who was on the left who was visibly irritated because she was older better-looking better dressed more drools than me but she was on the left and she was irritated slightly yes yes of course it did I'm here these pictures were taken by my father's father who was the tenth cube the bathroom pays homage to the boyhood of her father well there is a sir sitting in a rather charming a battered straw hat looking with some sad and that is one with his mother the Duchess had struggles to provide an heir after four girls finally she produced a boy the arrival was celebrated with bonfires and fireworks his title at birth was the Marquess of kamorin the stories in being on a bus and the bus stopped and he apparently said Danny Lemmy why are we moving and she said because a lot of traffic on the road you see we can't move the bus can't move it move it he went what they wouldn't do this if they knew the little ma Chris was on board like am I suppose he'd been he was known as the little mark Chris the family seat was Hornby Castle in Yorkshire within a couple of years of succeeding to the title in 1927 the new young Duke put the castle up for sale with cash in the bank he drifted round Europe ending up on the French Riviera this is a picture of his wedding to the Serbian ballet dancer he got married in Nice there is the bride who's looking pretty satisfied my father who's looking understandably apprehensive and nervous because there is his mother who basically wearing her gardening clothes and certainly a gardening hat she's looking as if she cannot really believe that her only son and heir is marrying the Serbian valid answer the marriage to the Serbian ballerina ended when she went off with an American millionaire the Duke remarried and they had a daughter Camilla to avoid heavy English taxes they moved to Jersey he was probably bored bad-tempered miserable being made to live there my mother was much younger and she met me fell in love with a young good-looking God's officer who is in the culturing gods that the result that she left me and my father my sick father had to leave the army and apparently his commanding officer said well Lawrence's is jolly sad isn't it I mean you know cause girls are one thing but I'm afraid Duchess is quite another within minutes a young woman had got her tabs on the newly available Duke she was terribly tall she was nearly 6 foot so she was bloody frightening and as well do you think the title is oh yes it had an enormous amount to do with it but looking back I mean if she wanted to be a duchess what do you think about your resemblance to I love looking like him I do yes well it's such a link hasn't it my stepmother and her less and generous moment said it was a great shame as I looked they liked him I was 12 when he died I was at boarding school and they summoned me back but I wasn't allowed to say goodbye to him I didn't see him before he died there was a funeral which I wasn't taken to and she knew under the terms of the trust that she couldn't inherit anything other than his personal possessions and she was obsessive about money but I remember her going on and on to a friend and this friends saying oh Carolyn you know I do think you could stop now because it's really not very nice for Camilla to listen to all this oh well she'll be all right but the she's bought the money and I was formed thirteen or something at the time on her father's death the title went to a distant cousin living in Rome sir Darcy Osborne a former British ambassador to the Vatican he was in his 70s and a Bachelor and when he died just six months later the Dukedom of leeds became extinct my father if he'd still have the place in Yorkshire he'd be like Bedford or Devon sure those that have got a purpose she's what I'm trying to say but I think it gives you a purpose and I think maybe that's why he wasn't a happy man because he had absolutely no purpose in his life except getting through getting through the day by going to the cinema or going to the tailor or having a you know the third pail no that was his life actually when the hornbeam was sold the coronation rose wonder of bed so they got they were sold but what remains are the three Coronets the ducal coronet the Duchess's coronet - democracy's Coronet and that you see there was a apparently you kept your sandwiches in there during the coronation because it went you know you were there for hours and hours and hours so you just have that on your on your head she that was quite comfortable I appreciate enormous ly what I've got but I think maybe like my father if I hadn't had it I would have had a happier life or more fulfilled one I mean I when you read death announcement so true you read them and it says after a life well-lived or after a fulfilled life I'm summarizing my more gloomy moments I think yes like I wouldn't say that and not that I've been unhappy but I just feel life had sort of the same slightly aimless life as my father did for different reasons the Dukedom of Leeds had been created for a crafty Yorkshire politician who had helped bring William and Mary to the throne in 1689 the Dukedom of sant Albans was created for less elevated reasons simply for the bastard son of king charles ii and the celebrated actress nell gwyn the family seat for many years was best wood Lodge in Nottingham sure but that is long gone the 14th duke of sand albans and his Duchess live in a terraced house in a quiet street in central London well here's the 10th the 10th do I used to say at the same time as that and here here's the sort of the good Duke who tend to was the last person to make a speech in the House of Lords and collided 327 years later haha laughter this is our corner do you still have the carnage yes male and female and the robes the we have a coronation robes really where are they up in there the carnage is out there in your study however yes I'm tae ho ho yeah okay that'll be overall vo1 I think that is huh actually it's the red one because it's in the original box and it's very very fragile oh yeah this is Murray's one I think they're rather lovely that's Murray do you hold your fire sure and I'll just get out my one I think it's just so pretty there's original pins which would be say 1680 you see those that's what so brilliantly clever those are the pins you would put in on in your hair and that would keep which the Queen obviously does so what I do is I do that second and I'm pressing it into mice my scalp and I do that and then I'm pressing it in like that and of course that is amazing because that's it look we have had no reason to whatever no any more that we've had any reason to wear the robes and actually in fact the my robes my portrait right ah and how should one address you well that's your grace it should be your grace quite a few a few people do quite a few of the restaurants call me your grace quite a few but then on the other hand you also get people it that that don't and so well that's we're gonna we're very technically relaxed but do you quite like it well I to be honest with you I like I do actually like formality but I've I've I've always liked formality regardless I don't like Christian names for instance terribly so it wouldn't suit me to me I don't I've been called Gillian actually particularly by people I don't know but that's in your chest for me really so what should I call it well you can call my first meeting you what should I have called you or did I call it I think I avoided it I think you avoided it which I think it's a very sensible thing to do because I think I could always often avoid things that I don't want to get involved with and then I go to hurt anybody's feelings or Oh beyond any problem that's about it so I think I would have done the same so for example when you're booking an airplane ticket oh that's an issue as they said they can't put in duke of duchess off because it won't fit into their computers which is what we're always being - so we go in and mr. and mrs. st. Albans fine we don't mind but because actually we were not we're not the kind that would want to necessarily throw in a title just because we want a better seat or whatever you know some people do that but we did but anyway very good terribly pretty isn't it very very yeah no I'm afraid having mentioned the the your robe you have to see the robes where are they are they next door oh well then that's it yeah but that really is an ordeal is it well okay that's banned because then everything but the the kitchen serves the health health and safety to the healthy Satan loose we need you loose okay if you'd like to come up with meals I know well don't worry we could just put the ironing board to the side loose for a secondary that doesn't matter no no don't worry I just take that no normally this would be easier in here actually we let these three yes it really is because Maurice is terribly heavy and in his well look you see in his case very very frail sure what we would say this seems to be multi anything yes a cheese is melted tremendously as long as the moths haven't got in it the Army is looking very unhappy this bothers me fortunately this is okay this one it's so it is beautifully made so that's lace yeah sixteen whatever so here is the original look should I take it yeah why don't you you take it like well there you can look I think that is that is what is really lovely I think sure under that yes to here actually look Mary in fact well done you for spotting that will have it like that that's cuz I think that's the ideal thing to do look at it it's simply beautiful how did you marry and what was arrested his title oh well I first of all I've it met Marie at a dinner party as far as him it's his title and I think it's a charming title actually I think it's particularly pretty one but actually my daughter's Godfather was a Duke of Manchester and I have known quite a few so it wasn't as if it really was at all a service and I think out of the ordinary is very very special but not the title particularly what we got here well we have me here and my coronation robes and token caught a lie for no stuffed unfair because I'm I read it aground Faulkner I think hereditary Grand Forks what does that mean well it means nothing now I think we'll used to be a salary of a thousand pounds a year reading us one time up to a few years ago one used to get a quarter idea pricier from Richmond Park but that was stopped by Tony Blair on the grounds of a con man hmm well what did you think of that was pretty poor show people to the Archbishop of Canterbury's to get it all in one trial appeal where did your ancestors leave you a bath stately mansion under huge wealth no they don't impress unfortunately so canals what do you do worked for a living what yes I have doing what well I'm a child of the king the Duke's son and heir is Charles Boclair who used to use his courtesy title at the Earl of Hereford but now chooses not to that is one of you he is a teacher and part-time historian and takes rather more interest than his dad in the family's history and that's the life as a boy so obviously the father of claritin I mean do you feel a connection to these ancestors probably exceptional enjoyed it mmm to some of them yes obviously some are obscure and they're just pictures and so on and they don't really come alive in your mind others do and I think obviously we're fortunate in being aware of the story of our family in a way that a lot of people aren't and therefore I think you can choose the way in which you become part of that story I mean we're all actors in it one day a Charles will be the Duke of Santa Albans it is often thought that any man in possession of a grand title must not be in want of a large stately but that is no longer the case for this dukedom Charles though is fascinated by Bestwood launched the pile that in other circumstances he might have inherited it is now a Best Western hotel yes this is best furred Lodge which was built between 1862 and 1865 by the 10th Duke esand Albans and there's a lot of fantasy to it you know you've got the figures of Robin Hood and his Merry Men over the porch there it was described at the time as acrobatic gothic which i think is a pretty good description Charles and his girlfriend Sarah are hoping to put on plays here and have been delving into its traumatic family history the 10th Duke a talented entrepreneur made a fortune and with three sons he thought he'd set up the family for generations to come but within months of his death it all started to unravel his son and heir Burford as he was called three months after he succeeded he was certified confined to an asylum in Sussex and that's where he spent the last 36 years of his life then the youngest brother Lord William Boclair also proved mad and just after leaving Eton he was sent to the Priory Roehampton he was there for 52 years completely forgotten by everyone and the middle brother Robbie who became a 12th Duke was a restless soul who wandered around the world and I think he became quite an embittered man and that's what fascinates me is why what created this mental illness I mean was it partly societal were they sensitive souls who couldn't harness themselves to the whole Imperial design or was it something more personal something the way they've been brought up it's like a kind of haunting passed down from generation to generation so I think the key is to become conscious of them and then that demon is purged through for future generations one of the reasons I gave up the title in the first place is because people's perceptions of you can actually create a sort of straightjacket it often attracts people who just want to know you because they're snobs and therefore you can fall into the wrong company very easily I think much better just to be mr. Boclair go about your business and but yes if I felt I could use it in a powerful and creative fashion and I I would if Charles doesn't take up the title this might be the last practical incarnation of it the Dukedom of Rutland was created as the result of a very pushy mother who demanded of Queen Anne that her late husband's military heroism be rewarded making her son-in-law a Duke this tradition of strong women has continued I remember very well the feeling of driving up here to beaver castle in my rather beaten up old Fiat and having to stop and take my breath back for a moment and seeing this extraordinary castle and thinking oh I'm going to stay there the building itself is so imposing it takes people's breath away Emma Watkins was a farmer's daughter from Wales when she met the then Marquess of Granby heir to the Duke of Rutland owner of Beaver Castle at a dinner party within a couple of years they married and she became the Marchioness when her father-in-law died her title changed the upgrade to Duchess how much for differences are they to me um well it makes a difference to others because they perceive you as a Duchess and suddenly you know too many people bearing in mind there are so few of us in the country it is all quite true about Jess you know she might be sitting up in an ivory tower with a sort of crown on and quite old and quite scary we're in our private rooms here and these are the rooms that are not too open to the public 24/7 and so they're areas where we can have some space and out here is our private Terrace which is I suppose it's our back garden in the sense and as you can see we've got our swings and our dog kennel our five dogs in marrying Emma the Duke found someone with whom to start a family who also turned out to be a determined and energetic estate manager but three years ago the marriage ran into difficulties with over 300 rooms at their disposal they came up with a relatively simple solution he lives in one tower and delves into the family archives she lives in another tower and as chief executive runs the place 7:30 a.m. and the senior staff assemble for her Grace's weekly meeting we've got full signups in the next two weeks it's a bit like when the King dies long live the king when the Duke dies long live the Duke and there was amazing moment that will remain with me forever when my mother in law there was a large black tin of keys enormous great keys and she handed me the box and said good luck but actually what we've got to do is address where it fell down and so I spent the week there wasn't one room that I hadn't managed to get into so you have to kind of know what it is that you're taking over I'm now going up onto the roof I'm meeting our architect and in a moment you're going to see why it's called build what beautiful castle beautiful view they were norman-french the man's family and they couldn't really pronounce beaver so they called it Belvoir because of the beautiful view let's go and see it but my architect is down here Peter oh I'm on a different roof to you so well how do I get out to that one you come up the spiral stairs yeah yes across and through pedal King's room middle King's room I'll be with you in two minutes pop down in here and find the right roof hi Peter we're it bubbles yes that's right that's all that's all the corrosion that's building so what problems is that create underneath it just makes the lead thin right how old is this lead it's as old as the building getting on for 200 years there's a little mark here 1883 Wow you can see what it is it's a little man riding a penny farthing yep so what sort of price are we talking about have this real netted it would use up an entire year's budget so about a hundred thousand and that's just one section of the two acres of roof looking after the future extends beyond mere buildings of course the Duchess took her Duty seriously and after three daughters produced two sons well obviously it's very important that you have a boy because boys carry the title and everything is entailed here at beaver so everything goes with the title there is definitely a feeling that I better have a boy the one that struggles most probably was darling Hugo who at four and a half said mum when Charles dies do I become the Duke so Charles isn't getting to die and you will never be the Duke but he sort of gets it now I think as long as you're very very clear with children from the outset about how it works there's no confusion in the Magnificent Elizabeth saloon there's a photoshoot for country and town house magazine the 21st century Duchess is conscious of the need to market the place and with its Midlands location she especially targets the lucrative Asian wedding business there is after all a certain Bollywood over-the-top quality to the day core today selling it as a family home are all the female members as daughters of a Duke they take the courtesy title of lady along with the family name Lady violet lady alice and lady eliza manners you ever think as the oldest about not being able to inherit I I would I wouldn't I wouldn't want for a tradition actually I think some for me personally I think I think in in years to come I think it'll be welcomed and I think it should happen that's it you know the elders should be allowed to inherit but I'm quite happy that it hasn't changed for me you know my brother I think because look forward shoulders can help the elves carry the weight pr"
0,"whip is the world's first deep geologic repository we ought to see if it can fulfill its mission has received more than 10,000 shipments it has in place more than 80,000 cubic meters of Defense transionic waste so it's accomplished something but it's supposed to accommodate more than twice as much waste as currently there it's supposed to dispose of the waste be decontaminated and decommissioned so that we can demonstrate technically and to the public that we actually can do that never been done anyplace in the world this is the most geologically and scientifically studied piece of real estate in the entire United States the main function is to dispose of transionic defense generated transuranic waste and all of those activities that pertain to that the Carter Administration was trying to figure out what to do with Nick is our waste there was a lot of debate public discussion Congress was trying to pass laws Carter came up with a program of saying we need nuclear power in this country we have nuclear weapons an atomic energy power plant has already proved feasible the future supplying of electric power to entire cities is far from impossible so the Carter Administration said we need multiple geologic disposal sites in multiple geologic regions eventually came on Yucca Mountain experts throughout the world agree that the most feasible and safe method for disposing of highly radioactive materials is to store them deep underground the facilities you see at the surface are only a small fraction of the science going on deep inside the distinctive Ridge we've invested billions of dollars in Yucca Mountain and has been found to be safe we've been preparing and planning for Yucca for disposal since 2002 we have high-level nuclear waste all over this country and we needed in one centralized location it's been our policy that that would be Yucca Mountain an isolated area of Nevada in the desert 90 miles from Las Vegas underneath a mountain in the desert in one of the most arid places in this country this is one of those issues where the federal government then tells a state you're going to take this that doesn't really work very well the state of Nevada said we don't want this because we don't believe that you did this in a consensus-based fashion you didn't ask us you basically just told us and so then you know became a wrangling fight for 25 years we still don't have a safe way to dispose of the nuclear waste until we figure out what we're going to do with the waste and the cost it's very hard to see nuclear as a part of our future but that's where American technology comes in let's figure out what we're going to do what this country needs to understand is there's nuclear waste all over the place and next and major population centers and MIT and next to major water reserves I believe that Yucca Mountain is a suitable place for storage and I know that there's controversy about it in lawsuits and all that it shouldn't America a country as smart as wise we are be able to find a place to store spent fuel when 2008 came around and Senator Reid was Senate Majority lead he basically you know asked to kill this because he didn't think it was science-based and this wasn't consensus and we didn't agree to this and all that kind of thing so it was basically killed this is a wonderful day for Nevada to make sure that this poisonous substance the most poisonous substance known to man isn't going to be hauled through the streets of Las Vegas Reno Boulder City and Henderson that you go just a few miles outside Las Vegas and be a danger to our water systems our way of life including tourism it's wonderful that it's going to be gone for more than 30 years the state of New Mexico has said no to being Yucca Mountain being a high level waste or a commercial spiritual repository so to me when that subject comes up again not for the first time not for the second time not for the third time it's come up lots of times and people have always said no way I kind of say you know or what about know do people not understand New Mexico has as you know been historically a nuclear state you know they're very familiar just from a general base of people in New Mexico of the nuclear industry what it represents in all facets of that right now we have a certain authorization basis that says this is what we are suited for the disposal of defense generated true waste and if called upon through you know the congressional action to look at that although today we are suited for true waste disposal we will go through it with the same rigor we did to ensure the safety and the operational efficiency and the environmentally sound way we would approach it in the same way but it all starts with congressional action they have to give this the authorization and right now with is limited with a kind of waste and with the volume of waste and we can put away right now it's it's limited to defense transuranic waste which is a mouthful for intermediate level waste from you know weapons research and production there are two kinds of transfer and equates to conduit contact handled the kind that's in 55-gallon drum kinds of containers and other containers that you or I or anybody can walk right up to and not get a significant dose of radioactivity because the container provides good shielding for current handling of it and remote handle transuranic waste which as the name implies you and I can't walk up to it without getting a significant dose and in fact in some cases a dose that could kill you pretty quickly so that waste has to be packaged in special lead shielded canisters taken to a separate special facility of the WIPP site so it can be handled remotely without people actually physically having to handle the canister this is where the cast is transported into the stores shut and what they do is they're lowering it down you can see that green panel there they'll lift that lid and it's lowered down into a transfer area transport it over and brought into the facility cask in another room over there I think what's the best thing to do is to go we're going to go down the salt shaft and we'll take a cart down there and we'll follow the route that the waste takes to go down to the disposal area which will be down the east 140 drift all the way down into the intake of channel 6 when whip was originally conceived there was the idea to actually have two different levels where we are now and one deeper for defense high level waste that was struck from the mission so we're still at only one level we could go deeper we could go higher the sequence itself is three thousand feet you went about two thousand feet here we'll get on this other cart here your buddy in so basically what you're seeing there is salt that's rock you can hit that with a hammer and ring like a bell we're going to go through an airlock here these airlocks the reason we have them is we have four different ventilation splits and in all those areas are kept separate some of it is to control the possibility of if you had a release of some sort controlling that ventilation and that release and some of it is just literally to be able to control the air because you've got a finite amount of air so the waste would turn here this isn't going into an active panel we're headed in into the panel where the waste is disposed this is the panel itself but this is typical these rooms they're 33 feet wide minimal 13 feet high and in the case of a room it's 300 feet long so the are a choices brought down in this room and then these Pistons the rams push it into the hole and there's interlocks and there's shielding associated with that to protect the workers leave the shield in place and they come in and they pull the piston back and they put that shield plug in place and then they push that in also so here's the CH way stack here's your contact handled waste basically we want to emplace this it's not a it's not storage it's disposable permanent disposal I guess you could always think that the folks in the future could be smarter than us and find some some use but they would have to recover it would just not be retrievable they'd have to recover it in some way basically we want to make sure that we communicate with the future what we've stored underground what those dangers may be underground at the end when we close the first 100 years is called active institutional controls and during that first 100 years you have guards ito that are keeping people out and keeping them from jolin after that it's the passive institutional controls the passive institutional controls consist of three elements and one of them is the designs the actual markers that will be left behind after we decommission the site and return it back to public use so during that the first hundred years we would be building the passive institutional controls piece which is the markers the rooms putting on the languages telling a message talking thousands of years here we may not have a United States and three thousand years it may be a hole it may be split up among several countries who's to say I mean all those possibilities have to be considered what do you think is in the future for what do you think it's moving toward high-level waste well I think you know we have the land withdrawal Act and it basically specifies that we're supposed to have you know take true waste it would take a an act of Congress if you will to change that Act I have never seen a scientific or technique as scientifically or technically convincing reason why salt and we could not accommodate high-level waste history has shown that there isn't a quick fix solution to the problem we need geologic repositories that's fine let's start a long process to come up with that but whippin New Mexico just like Nevada should be not considered for that because it doesn't consent New Mexico shouldn't be considered for that because it doesn't consent now you consider out and hope that it's all going to be resolved if the next election breaks right and that's been exactly the hope for 40 years and it hadn't worked now we got a problem we got a problem in this country that is very very difficult to solve we don't know if we got the answers here if you're looking for the best solution you would be on that search for the Holy Grail and you will never get there if you stand around and insist on your yoga which people have been insisting on for a long long time but have not been able to pull it off we think the result of that is an impasse a failure to solve the problem where do you go you"
0,we are all searching for something for most the complexities of modern-day existence have us trapped in a state of mind a place where our truest potential is clouded by the expectations of society what does it take to awake from the haze in our search for the answer we were told of a man who had been through it all and broken free this is a story of DAG Abbie that Yami is probably the neatest old gentleman I have ever run into in my life we used to run in each other the pub no Deana we sit down and have a little chitchat bring ourselves up to speed on what's going on in her life and he's given me chef you're still working and I said well Christ I Lindy you're still running so what's the issue yeah he he's somewhat reclusive and he lives halfway up so we start in the school bus and very few people know where it is I haven't seen it yet I've been invited but my fat little body may not get all the way up the hill to her he goes cuz I mean he hustles smoke I mean he still goes and runs a hundred mile races and and finishes first in his class and I'm thinking I couldn't come closer to what he dies I had got introduced to dag and to her enough Johansson his friends from Norway and they were both here too or at sunshine too to get a Canadians certification that would have been about 71 72 in that era I can remember at sunshine on some of the cliffs he was always leaping over those every free moment he had he was he was freestyling and he wasn't that interested in doing a snow plow Turner we're working on the some of those basics and you know he could go off a jump and he was always kind of knew where where the feet should be he wasn't driven by any kind of a financial thing as long as he had enough money to put a little bit of food into his stomach and and have a few beers he was a happy camper it was it was in the Whistler area and he had been skiing trying to get into the powder and there was a very large avalanche he managed to ski out through it and didn't break any bones and didn't hurt his pride by getting caught underneath it and yeah he's not very many people can I would ski those things and it was a big one with Deng he doesn't have a phone he doesn't have email he's very elusive very mysterious my fascination with him I guess you could say began a long time ago I grew up here and thought wow like this this is such a cool local guy I really want to do a local feature about him and thus began the process of finding him which as you know is no easy feat the first time I met with dag I think it was early spring and I didn't really know completely where we were going my editor thought it was completely crazy he's like you're going out of cell service up a mountain with this brand and got like what are you thinking it was like it was a good hike I was pretty pretty wiped by the end of it just beautiful and so cool to just kind of hang out with him kind of on an informal basis and and chat with him such a privilege to go up there and just really rewarding to bring to light this story of this local man that I think a lot of people have seen him they kind of know a little bit about him but maybe not the first story not that we'll ever probably know the full story of day after weeks of searching we remain empty-handed an uneasy feeling falls over us smoke from nearing wildfires settles in the valley a once fierce Sun now cast a muted light and the mountains disappear behind the haze we can't help but see the smoke as a symbol for Dex elusiveness maybe never that easy it's a complement to life work as hard as you can to stay alive because there's a gift life is a gift to me there is no age it's just life you know H is something other people will put on you like when my dad got fifty they said oh yeah oh no you can't go in the ghost by yourself yeah and the age has been put to me all my life and so H is something I deal with and to me I don't have an age I am an independent person I had my family and and everything has been great and that was my turn to live as simple as possible where I can train hard I can can be outside because I love being outside I can do everything I want I I don't think I could ever live in the house I live in the bus now I could never live in the house I couldn't just yeah because I don't need much room I called my place of my lair because I'm I'm gone all day but building trails in an unknown place is exploring yeah you're exploring something new you're going where people haven't been for a long long time it's an art form because of you like I say you wanna read a minute you know it's not like you're building a road you just go straight no here you have to fold in the land if you want to have a life where you have more to do that time a trail gives you that because you know you're always working out I'm perfectly imperfect because if you're perfectly imperfect you always have to work on yourself you can always try I am what am I saying is you know tomorrow I want to be a better person than today you can always work in yourself and if you work on yourself you don't have time to talk about other people or worry about other people you know I get a lot oh and seeing comments from people because they don't understand Stanley what is there to understand I don't try to understand people you know they do their thing I leave them alone yeah their only person you won't understand really it's yourself so I'm gonna just keep them moving their way I do you know because like I said there's no each hold in your head but you know he puts a person in walks walks on this person gonna die pretty quick because you said that you're old now you're ready to go you know but my I can't have a bad death because when I was back I have a full wife to look back on I didn't spend in front of a TV I always thought of something and I did it and that's why I did so much in my life I just went out on the landing and what the hell
0,we're about to introduce you to americans desperate for you to know that they exist people all across the country working in jobs once considered middle class but now living far below a middle class lifestyle how did this dramatic income inequality happen on such a wide scale and what can be done about it here's abc's diane sawyer miller played songs that made the hit parade return with us to the sights and sounds of archie bunker's neighborhood 30 years ago the television symbol of living in the american working class call rudy in california on the phone no we just open up the window in holland here's archie's house today the blue one on the right kathy massey moved into archie's neighborhood 40 years ago her husband was a truck driver she showed us who's buying these houses now he's a banker he's a ceo kids today that are professionals with advanced degrees can't even afford to live here she says in 1978 her house cost almost sixty thousand dollars today it's valued at eight hundred thousand those homes were built for middle class americans they were built for teachers they were built for firefighters they were built for nurses and those types of people can't afford those homes anymore and these soaring house prices aren't just in new york it's happening in job markets across the country i love this town i love this community this is mauritius i'm sorry i didn't expect to get emotional you are looking at the new face of displacement she's one of the people caught in the vicious choice between affording where you live and affording your life i think i grew up middle class my parents have four children they own their home i didn't imagine i would still be without any idea of how it would get into a house at this point her husband is a microbiologist at a lab they rent a small two bedroom apartment in california make this brand better college savings for the girls nothing add to it the 25 hike in rent in her town of burlingame california her neighborhood being squeezed by high-tech millionaires across the country in kansas city we meet terrence wise another american who believes you built a life on hard work he leaves home at 5 30 and returns 16 hours later he records the beginning of his day just like everybody in america heading to work trying to take care of my family good morning how are you doing when we meet him he has two jobs at fast food franchises one at burger king a second at mcdonald's it takes him eight buses to commute to and from his work there's three more buses to go thank you and there's a big change in the fast food worker back in 1980 the majority of fast food workers were teenagers but today 75 percent of these workers are in their 20s or older a third of them with children the american people some may look and say it's something you didn't do right and they think okay well you should have stayed in school or you should have did this well look i'm working i have a family we're at where we're at in this life right now this wasn't the life that terrance had planned he says he was once a smart kid in high school dreaming of the university of south carolina but he had to help with family bills i've been at burger king what 11 years now eight dollars an hour after 11 years of service and yet after all those buses all those hours he says no vacation time no benefits you go into these mcdonald's or any restaurant and you notice the smiling faces but when he leaves he goes home to little food of his own or no lights no water and it's it's hard to see that through a smiling face terence points out his hours can be reduced so his income isn't guaranteed one of the hardest things watching the leftover food at the end of the shift what do they do with the food that is left over where i work the food is thrown away two years ago a worker in another store posted this on at the end of the youtube that we have to throw away when we meet terence he has already become a passionate advocate at the center of the national movement called fight for 15. arguing for an increase in the federal minimum wage from 7.25 cents i know with fifteen dollars an hour if it started tomorrow i would only have to work one job then i would have an opportunity to go to work and then go to school the top companies in the fast food industry made combined profits of 6.6 billion dollars in 2015. well one study shows 52 of all their employees are getting some form of public assistance is this a way taxpayers are subsidizing the industry nobody wants to get food stamps i want to go in and pull out my cash and buy my food and and and have insurance through my job and again he says a little more makes so much difference they don't see a move i haven't been to the movie since the matrix and i don't know if you know how old that movie is yep this is our stuff there has always been income inequality in america but as we said today it's more extreme take silicon valley the high-tech companies with the golden names where employees get free food any kind as much as they want free dry cleaning gyms on site and right there all around them thousands of other people also working very hard in the shadows there amid all the wealth we heard about the drivers of employee shuttle buses when we began our report we found drivers sleeping in the parking lot 35 to 40 bus drivers are here people are sleeping all over here on their cars it's just awful when you park inside and you have drivers covering their cars with blankets and towels these drivers are what's called contract employees working for companies who provide them to the high tech industry when we met them they had few benefits little vacation no paid holidays i just turned the ignition switch on to accessory at that time one of the drivers ferrying apple employees to their campus was scott peebles he was trying to save money for a rental apartment someplace nearby but at the time was living in his car using an inflatable mattress i mean if people would know this if corporations or the businesses that they work for there would probably be a guest that their employees were living in a car or van cover on and then i just closed the store and say good night we saw the parallel lives near luxury houses trailers parked in the streets service employees living so differently from the people they serve and all over the country there are business leaders saying it's time to bring new ideas to american workers and their wages and this is a man named mark bertolini who has ideas of his own he's the son of an auto worker successful ceo of a goliath company edna healthcare 49 000 employees bertolini says it all has to begin with corporate leaders who want to learn the lives of their workers where do they live and what are their lives like and it took me six months to get that data but once i got the data i was embarrassed he says when he became ceo he was surprised to discover that some of his full-time employees were paid so little they had to go on public assistance i said how can we let this happen here we are a major fortune 50 company with employees who are suffering every day to make ends meet so aetna raised salaries to at least 16 an hour they're helping workers pay down college debts and he vowed not to pass any of these costs onto the etna consumer 18 of the american public actually believes corporations are good 18 percent so how much lower do we need to go before we figure out this doesn't work and so instead of waiting for it to go away why don't we step forward with some courage and conviction to make it better a new capitalism yeah let's reinvent it i mean we're the captains of it why shouldn't we be the ones that say here's the new way and bertolini says if there are ceos in america who don't know where to start just give him a call a lot has changed since diane reported from that parking lot in silicon valley the bus drivers voted to unionize and there was publicity around low wages and few benefits so facebook ceo sheryl sandberg responded and took action she said all facebook contract employees should have higher salaries and 15 days of paid time off apple and google followed her lead and those drivers we met on the parking lot say it's made a huge difference and you remember scott peebles the man who was living in his car while he's now renting an apartment
0,it's very easy to be overwhelmed by China a booming nation of 1.3 billion people who's increasingly prosperous lives are driving development on a scale the world has never seen China is constantly on the move it's estimated that in the next decade 350 million people will leave the land for the city it is the largest population movement in human history and it's leading to the rise and rise of the mega city the old gives way to the new entire cities emerge seemingly from nowhere well it's absolutely phenomenal then when you look at the scale of the cities Chongqing 31 and a half million people in Chongqing it's and most people have never heard of it Melbourne architect Robert Caulfield is among the experts who've been invited in by the Chinese they like his grand designers and have awarded him prized contracts to transform not just a few blocks but entire cities just over in that area there will be the new hub from sketch to animation to construction it all happens at dizzying speed one of our projects they were actually putting in the roads before we'd even finish the drawings and we just couldn't produce it fast enough so as quick as you're drawing it they're building it well quicker than we were drawing it's like China Inc it's like a a corporation that the five-year plan everyone going in the one direction I've had it suggested to me that doing business with the Communists is good because they make a decision while they do make decisions it's that full-throttle philosophy that has transformed cities like Shanghai no matter what the cost this is a common sight on old buildings these red painted characters translated mean to be demolished it won't be long before this block becomes another skyscraper in the middle of this soaring metropolis we come across a grand old traditional Chinese house marked for destruction Nihao good to meet you mrs. sure and her family have lived here for 70 years and that protest banner in the window lets everyone around here know they don't want to move so let me understand this let's have a look at your neighbors one big high-rise there another big high-rise there and your house right in the middle but you don't want to move no they're asking us to leave but we will never be willing to do so mrs. shows not alone in trying to hold her ground have a look at what happens when people like her refuse to budge the developers just build around them no matter how absurd the lengths or depths they have to go to there's no time to dispute no lodging a building complaint with counsel developers simply move too fast and the new buildings appear as quickly as it takes to demolish the old ones this 30 story hotel went up in just two weeks so basically prefabricated floor plates and prefabricated walls that are all just moved in and put in place by a crane it's like a big Lego set the danger with that sort of development is that there is a risk of a lot of buildings being built that all look the same however this unfathomable ambition to rehouse hundreds of millions of citizens has created some truly bizarre anomalies have you ever wondered what it might be like if you were the last person on earth well I'd imagine that it would be something like this and I've got to tell you it is a very strange and eerie feeling everything is here an entire city all the buildings the roads schools hospitals you name it everything that is except the people and looking around there is not a soul to be seen this is a new city he called Lingam an hour's drive from Shanghai built for nearly a million people it's almost like a cardboard cutout of a city and in some places a giant facade rows of vacant shops restaurants and office buildings waiting for customers diners and works when you walk around these ghost cities what are your thoughts what am i thought well I mean I just don't gobsmacked I mean I'm gobsmacked that there are so many malls and an empty apartments just standing vacant and yet they're still building more it just it doesn't seem to make sense Hong kong-based Financial Analysts gilliam taluk since neither he nor the world has ever seen anything like the phenomenon of China's ghost cities they've constructed huge residential areas with shopping malls etc and no one's moved in to live in them just because you build it doesn't mean they'll come clearly they're not coming no I mean 700 million people in China live on less than $2 a day they simply can't afford these and that's why these apartments are sitting empty because there's no one who can afford to live in them it's not just residential developments sprawling commercial districts also lie empty this is you job Putin new city type to become China's Manhattan in fact challenging New York is the world's biggest financial district but on our biblical journey we find it is utterly devoid of any sign of life this is one of the more staggering sites I think I've seen it's an entire city quite literally frozen in time now only six months ago construction on this massive project was in full swing but now it's all that a standstill I can count at least 30 skyscrapers over there where the work has completely stopped officially they say that this project is just on hold but you've got to say especially in these sub-zero temperatures the future of this city looks especially bleak this is the largest prophecy bubble that has ever been selfishly from Australia's point of view we like this bubble because we keep shipping iron ore and other raw materials to China so they can keep building these cities yeah I wouldn't give up the day job as they say I mean I'd be very nervous because if the bubble does burst then you simply have to follow the supply chain and the supply chain ends up in in Australia but for the Australians helping to build the new China all this construction makes perfect sense when you remember China's booming population thriving middle class and unwavering drive to become the world's dominant superpower well it's absolutely phenomenal because there's somewhere between 4 and 500 million people still living in what the Chinese government considers to be inadequate accommodation so they're going healthful ever to build this accommodation four to five hundred million people I mean it's hard to get your head around it they're staggering you know I could take Robert Caulfield has been commissioned to redesign a vast area of the historic city of Nanjing and the journey there is a reminder of why China's mega cities work they're connected by 10000 kilometers of high-speed train lines and look at the speed now 303 kilometers an hour and accelerating imagine run of these running between Sydney and Melbourne on blinking you'd be there yeah that's right it's got a very long and rich history Nanjing was once the ancient capital of China home to the Ming Dynasty and a revered site it's now entrusted to an Australian architect with some big ideas we're proposing a cable car system that goes right along the front of the lake core field also has approved plans for a futuristic project in the city center well we've got here Michael is that just over in that area there will be the new hub building and there's a high-speed rail that goes actually through these buildings here and this goes for about five kilometers down this road and there'll be a number of high-rise factories in this area but it's one thing to sit in your Melbourne office and dream up this amazing renovation of a city but to be standing here and seeing it underway it is quite remarkable that's it happened so quickly and there's 24 square kilometres in this master planning area that we've done that's enormous that just seems to be the way things roll in the new China everything happens at a frantic pace Robert Caulfield just hopes they let him get the drawings done first so no idea is too big it's really quite strange Michael because you know I'll go back in a couple of days to Melbourne office where we're working on three or four retirement villages and in the next week we'll be working on a city yeah it's fear it's a very exciting time though and for all

0,"This girl is telling me about a moment when someone
 threw a Molotov cocktail, which she's calling hot paint, over that wall into
 her apartment complex, but the casual nature with which this little girl is
 telling me this story is a clue that this isn't your typical apartment
 complex. I'm in East Jerusalem in a Palestinian neighborhood, but I'm in a
 compound where a number of Jewish families live
 surrounded by fortified walls and private security. This girl's school bus
 has bulletproof glass. I got into this compound to ask them why they're living
 here. One component of this buildin,g these buildings, these six buildings is
 that they are a physical structure in eastern Jerusalem with a flag on top and
 says the Jews are here Israel's here. She is one of about 2,600 hard-line
 religious Jews, who buy up homes from Palestinian families in Palestinian
 neighborhoods, often clandestinely and with huge sums of money from
 international donors. I visited some of these families to better understand the
 motivations at play here and to see what life is like at the
 ideological epicenter of this conflict. In 1948 the newly declared State of
 Israel was fighting a war with its Arab neighbors. That war ended with a
 ceasefire line called the Green Line. If you zoom in to the Green Line you'll see
 that it goes right through Jerusalem with Israel controlling the West and
 Jordan controlling the East. And Jerusalem's Old City, which is this tiny
 piece of land where Jews Christians and Muslims all have holy sites, was right on
 the Green Line, but it was on the east side controlled by Jordan. And during
 that time Jews were not permitted to visit the Western Wall, which is the
 holiest site in Judaism. Then in 1967 Israel seized control of the entire West
 Bank, including East Jerusalem. Israel then pulled a highly controversial move:
 they declared that the eastern part of Jerusalem as well as 27 Palestinian
 villages surrounding it, were now a part of Israel. They erased the Green Line
 that separated the city and drew a new municipal border, announcing that it was
 now unified Jerusalem the capital of Israel. On paper this map does look
 unified, but in reality the city remained completely divided. The Palestinians in
 the East didn't want to be a part of this new country that they had just been
 annexed into, so in order to cement their claim and establish a Jewish presence in
 Eastern Jerusalem Israel built 12 huge neighbourhood blocks adjacent to
 Palestinian neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, while simultaneously creating
 policies that limited Palestinian urban development in the east. The world saw
 this as illegal and refused to recognize Israel's new definition of Jerusalem, but
 that didn't stop Israel from building these neighborhoods. But there's a difference between the 200,000 Israelis that are living in these 12 big
 neighborhood blocks and the Israelis who buy up individual properties in
 Palestinian neighborhoods. The big neighborhoods serve as a way to
 establish a large Jewish presence in East Jerusalem. It's part of a political
 strategy to claim large sections of land, preventing any future division of the
 city, but the Israelis that are buying individual Palestinian homes have a
 mission that is different. Their objective is based
 more on the biblical significance of tiny pieces of land throughout the city.
 The settlers of East Jerusalem have a thermal map. Not everything glows with
 the same intensity. They settle areas that resonate with biblical history and
 have a proximity to the Temple Mount or at the very least are within the visual
 basin of the Temple Mount. That is their homeland. There are two right-wing
 organizations that are dedicated to this aggressive settlement project. They have
 targeted a handful of spots in the city that they want to occupy, but that are in
 Palestinian neighborhoods these organizations raise large amounts of
 money from international donors and they use this money to buy properties from
 Palestinians for a price that is well above market value. The settlers are
 perseverant and they will spend years chipping away to try and get one
 property. Once they've secured a property they will move a Jewish family in,
 sometimes under the cover of night and escorted by soldiers. The families are
 then protected by 24-hour private security that is provided by the Israeli
 government costing about $25 million per year to the Israeli
 taxpayers for these 2,600 Israelis living in Palestinian neighborhoods.
 Needless to say Palestinian neighbors are not thrilled about these secret
 militarized move-ins into their neighborhoods. I spent a Friday evening with several of
 these people to better understand their motives. We walked up from one compound
 up the Mount of Olives to another compound for Sabbath prayers. This one
 was purchased from a Palestinian man who was in debt from a gambling problem. And they bought the house from them. And they bought the house from them for a very good price. I watched these settlers pray as they look down over the city and as I talked to them, I began to
 realize that in order to understand why they do this you have to understand the
 internal logic that they adhere to. The whole project of the State of Israel is
 a Jewish project the State of Israel is the biggest Jewish organization. If
 you want to vote in the Jewish country there's an easy way: become a Jew. We have
 a way in. And then you can you can have an effect country if you so wish, but if
 you're another minority then god bless you. You have a huge region. Allah loves
 you. These hardliners believe that Israel
 exists primarily for Jews and thus they're entitled to rights and benefits
 that others are not. We like democracy, but it's not a god. All
 it is is an operating system. If it needs to change, if it needs an update, you know
 if you need to download the latest version, it needs to change for your
 particular environment. To them, going out and buying Palestinian homes isn't a
 politically dubious land grab. In fact it's a noble spiritual mission, one that
 has been prophesied about for thousands of years. When I'm living in this
 place give me a purpose it gives me a reason. Even if I'm not doing
 something ideological that at that moment, I'm living in a place that's ideological. It gives my life, every second a meaning. And thanks to effective
 lobbying by these groups, the Messianic paradigm has seeped into government
 policy as well, aiding the settlers on their mission to sink roots into the
 eastern part of the city. An example of this is a law that says only Jews can
 buy property in the Jewish quarter of the Old City, but that anyone can buy property in the other quarters. The settler organizations
 have targeted the Muslim quarter for their purchases due to its proximity to
 the Temple Mount and they now have dozens of holdings there. The government
 has also granted these two organizations jurisdiction over many of the public
 spaces in the city that have been deemed archaeological sites, or national
 parks. Some of these sites are situated in Palestinian neighborhoods that are at
 the top of the list for the Jewish home purchases. Places like Silwan in the City
 of David. These right-wing organizations are using their jurisdiction to shape
 the public realm of Palestinian neighborhoods, to reflect their agenda of
 a Jewish Jerusalem. The result is a government supported, militarized,
 ideological gentrification of Jerusalem. One house at a time. As we zoom out, you
 can see that between the national parks and the individual properties, these
 organizations have amassed a strong influence both public and private in and
 around the old city, where their holiest religious sites are. Meanwhile the
 Palestinians who live in East Jerusalem are in this weird legal limbo, where they
 live in the municipal borders of the annexed city of Jerusalem, but they don't
 have Israeli citizenship. They can't vote in national elections. This leads to
 severe neglect from public investment. The reason for that is politicians never
 allocate resources, funds, time, entitlements, to people who don't vote or
 can't vote. Almost 90% of the sewage pipes, roads, and
 sidewalks in Jerusalem are found in the West. And you can see that the
 proportions of public resources are heavily skewed towards West Jerusalem,
 even though a third of the population lives in the East. Last week the municipality said we will renovate the schools in East Jerusalem that are
 in desperate need, they're dilapidated and overcrowded, but you have to adopt the
 Israeli curriculum, something that the Palestinians have refused to do since
 1967. So your kids can study in a decent physical environment, provided that you
 peddle your national identity in exchange for that. That's the kind of
 Faustian deal that the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem are not going to
 accept. It's hard to imagine when or how this situation will ever be resolved.
 Palestinians in East Jerusalem don't want Israeli citizenship. They were
 annexed against their will into a country that doesn't recognize their
 full rights. And as Jewish neighborhoods grow in East Jerusalem, Israel's grasp over
 the city becomes tighter and tighter."
0,Jack Phillip says he's not just a baker he's an artist part of it is icing piping part of his paintbrush part of it is airbrush create the leaves and the flowers his canvas cakes like these we paint on cakes we sculpt cakes we sketch cakes it's design what we're gonna do deeply religious Philip says his Christian faith guides everything in his life this one is a verse out of first Corinthians stand firm be strong and immovable always working thewe Z a Stickley for the Lord including his refusal to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple that cake is that strong of a message in our culture and marriage in general between a man and woman across all cultures religions is an inherently religious event that faiths part of an epic legal clash between religious liberty and gay rights all of which began when Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins walked into masterpiece cake shop in 2012 like any couple Charlie and I were really excited to be getting married same-sex marriage was still not legal in Colorado so the couple was planning to get married in Massachusetts followed by a reception back home near Denver and on this particular day when we were going to sample wedding cakes and when David and Charlie came in we introduced ourselves what can I do for you we're here to look at wedding cakes it's for our wedding it was a really special day because Charlie's mom was in town she does not live in Denver so she was particularly excited so I realize right then that this is not a cake that I'm gonna be able to design and create for them so I tried to apologize to him so you know also you cookies brownies birthday cakes anything else in my store but we weren't in there for brownies for my birthday we were in there because we needed a cake to serve at our reception and at which point they both jumped up swore at me stormed out of my shop you know Charlie had a binder full of ideas and concepts you know well we never even got a chance to open the binder you don't see it as an act of discrimination I see it as an act of following my faith it's not just a cake is it an iconic symbol of a wedding this is a religious ceremony that goes in direct conflict with my face when I realized exactly what had happened in the car you know I broke down and started crying that one encounter at this unassuming cake shop in Lakewood Colorado just propelled both the cake Baker and the couple into the center of a scorching national debate that went all the way to the highest court in the land and today in a 72 decision the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Baker it's good for Jack it's good for businesses who want to run their businesses according to their convictions whether they're Christians Muslims Jews secular whatever the case might be I think it's good for that and celebrations erupted outside Phillips's store just a great day to have cake I'm very excited Craig and Mullins say they were blindsided by the decision the first emotions were just shock and disappointment the bakery may have won the battle but it has certainly lost the war the court really recognized today the deep harms of discrimination and those harms apply equally when it comes to LGBT people we were in Colorado just last week only days before today's far-reaching decision for Mullins and Craig even over five years later that brief interaction still stings I was mortified I mean neither one of us had ever been treated this way before at a business dejected and furious the couple posted about their experience on Facebook we wrote just a small modest post that said hey we were discriminated against this cake shop their post went viral we received this outpouring of support from people literally around the world encouraged by the public response the couple filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission Colorado is one of 21 states that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation Colorado's Civil Rights Commission ruled in favor of the couple describing the Baker's refusal based on his religious beliefs as one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that decision was upheld by the Colorado Court of Appeals it made us feel like we were valued members of our community it's not about hate this is about not creating a message and a government forcing me to because people have called you a bigot I'm not I serve everybody who comes in my store I just don't create cakes every cake that people asked me to create as part of the ruling the Commission ordered Philips to retrain his employees and serve everyone wedding cakes regardless of sexual orientation so he stopped making wedding cakes altogether his refusal he says cost him 40% of his business and worse we've had death threats we've had emails phone calls I was going to turn upside down aided by the Alliance defending freedom a Christian advocacy organization Philips petitioned the Supreme Court to take his case we're asking the court to look at it as creative professionals should they be forced to violate the First Amendment our deeply held religious beliefs to create art that violates those beliefs which is more important saying the state of Colorado violated his First Amendment rights of freedom of religion and speech and there's the slippery slope of does this chip away at other artisans whether it's a jeweler or a makeup artist or others who would then have the ability to essentially boycott gay marriages I think that the Supreme Court is looking at all that those were good questions that they asked in my case however that's not an issue what I do I paint on cakes I sculpt cakes it's clearly art it's clearly protected this isn't about a cake it's about the right of people to receive equal service at a place of business that anyone else would the news that the court would take up the case was a shock to everyone involved the weight of both movements sitting squarely on their shoulders I know it's hard to predict how you will feel but if it came down in your favor how would you react I would be probably overjoyed couldn't you create a generic wedding cake that would be available for anybody who walked in and then customized for certain people or is that against the that would be sidestepping the issue that's still the government forcing me to create cakes for ceremonies that go against my faith I think sadness and fear over what the future will look like for people based on this precedent so this was a 72 decision but there was actually a lot of disagreements even among the justices who agreed with the outcome in the case Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the opinion for the court the only dissenting justices were Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor today's ruling a narrow victory for religious rights advocates at least four justices affirming gay rights but ruling in favor of the Baker because ironically they say it was he who faced anti religious bias calling out the Colorado Commission's language as disrespectful and hostile towards his sincere religious beliefs I think it's hard to know just reading the opinion what it's going to mean kind of on on the ground in practice coming out of this I think we know that it's important for state officials to approach these kinds of disputes respectful of the claims on all sides LGBTQ groups including GLAAD worry this ruling could open the floodgates for bigotry hiding behind religious exemptions you're well aware that history historically businesses have used religious exemptions to deny service to after chimeric ins at hotels or restaurants or I can't answer for that all I can say is that that's not my belief at all there's no question that opponents of LGBT equality will and already have seized on today's opinion as standing for far more than it does this case was never about cakes and we know our opposition won't stop at the cake shop today the move was celebratory but Dave Mullins and Charlie Craig say the fight for equal rights is far from over the struggle is real and you know civil rights aren't gained overnight and you know we hope that we've raised awareness not just in Colorado but across the country of how this form of discrimination affects LGBT people across the country every day hi everyone George Stephanopoulos here thanks for checking out the ABC News youtube channel if you'd like to

0,"I would say there's three
 crises occurring right now. There's an operational crisis, there's a humanitarian crisis, and there's a policy crisis. If you look at the numbers from March, there was over 100,000 people
 that came across the borders. Roughly 53,000 of those
 individuals were family units, and 39,000 were children. So it's truly unprecedented the numbers that we're seeing come across. Narrator: The United States Border Patrol has long been under
 scrutiny due to allegations of mistreatment toward
 migrants at the border. We spent a day at the US-Mexico border with the Border Patrol,
 and this is what we saw. Tessa: So this is one of the boundaries, like, this building is in Mexico. Man: OK. Narrator: On a hot Saturday
 afternoon in April, US Border Patrol agent Tessa Reyes gave us a tour of the border in El Paso and the surrounding area where
 immigrants seeking asylum turned themselves in
 to Border Patrol agents posted at the crossing sites. So right now we're on the border, kind of in the tristate area. We've got New Mexico right here, we've got Texas right
 here, and then we have right behind us is Mexico. There's no fence out here.
 There's no barriers of any kind. And you guys will see. We've
 had a lot of crossings. This is a very, very busy area. This is one of the areas where we're, we're having a lot of trouble keeping up with the demand. So this is Mexico, and we have the municipal police. Every now and then, you know, they'll kinda help us out or whatever. But for the most part, we stay over here, and they stay over there. Interviewer: So who are these folks over here under the trees? Tessa: Uh, these look like a group either waiting to cross,
 or they might be waiting for another part of their group. They might be waiting for more people to come. So that's why we have this agent out here. He's kinda just waiting. We usually try to have
 one here at all times just because it is such a busy area and, you know, you never
 know what's gonna happen. So he's kind of just reactive
 to whatever's going on, and he can call for transport if the group does come or when they come across. Kids are especially a vulnerable group, and we try our darnedest to process them and get them where they need to be. We're trying to keep everyone together. No separations, you know, obviously, kids are the
 priority and women as well. We're just trying to expedite
 the process a little more because we're overrun. Interviewer: How stretched
 is Border Patrol right now in terms of the volume
 that you guys are seeing? The El Paso Sector is probably stretched more than it's ever been
 in easily the last... I mean, I've been here 10
 years, and I've never seen this. Roughly 40% of the agents' times are spent on duties other than their
 law-enforcement mission, what they signed up to do. Processing, transporting people to the Border Patrol stations or to the hospitals. Lots of compassion that is
 occurring along the border, especially with the Border Patrol agents, but that is not why they signed up to be Border Patrol agents. Narrator: Due to the volume of crossings, the Department of Homeland
 Security shut down all six federal-inspection stations in the El Paso Sector. Normally, all vehicles would be required to pull into checkpoints like this one. I always thought that the checkpoints we're kind of untouchable,
 and the fact that we can't afford to man these is just really just insane. It's really just overwhelmed us. There's far less agents
 that are on the line that are doing actual enforcement. Actually, we can go through here. Oh, here we got some guys. So you had a group of 23,
 and then they took 'em, and this is what's left? Man: Yeah. Tessa: OK, 10-four. All right then, man, we
 just wanted to check, see if you're OK. Yeah, no, I'm good. OK.
 Just waiting for transport. All right. All right, take it easy. All right. As you can see, there's mostly children. We have an infant. So that's another layer of the care that we have to go through. You know, diapers, formula,
 all that kind of stuff. They're each gonna get
 medically screened and, uh, hopefully go through the
 process as soon as possible. Um, this is one of the areas that they turn themselves in a lot to. Yo. What's going on? He's directing them to keep going that way 'cause we have another
 agent I guess over there. Interviewer: What'd they say? These guys are from
 Honduras, or Guatemala, and then they're from El Salvador. Interviewer: So what's
 gonna happen to these folks? So now these, they're gonna
 be taken to processing, which is not very far. They enter through right here. It's the end of the fence. There's a break in the fence right here, and they can just walk up, and there's always an agent here. Two of 'em have a bit of a cough, so everyone's gonna need to be screened, and then we try as quickly as we can to process for asylum. When they get the bus out here, they'll take 'em to one
 of our processing centers, more than likely PDT, which is right here. So this is a good area for them to come because processing is right here, you know? Narrator: This is as close
 as we were able to get to the processing center. Border Patrol would not
 allow us to film inside. At the end of last year,
 we had two children that died in our custody, and so I would say the No. 1 thing that keeps me up at night is to ensure that another child does not die in our custody. I have seen more compassion
 from the US Border Patrol, the men and women of the Border Patrol, than I have seen in any other job that I have had the
 privilege of occupying. It's just the huge influx of people that are coming across. Very difficult for the
 Border Patrol to deal with. Narrator: The day after
 this interview was taped, a 16-year-old Guatemalan boy
 died in a Texas hospital. After initially being
 detained by the Border Patrol, the boy was transferred to the custody of a government-contracted shelter before being sent to a
 hospital in Brownsville where he died due to what the Guatemalan Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs described as a severe infection in the frontal lobe, becoming the third child
 since December 2018 to die after being detained."
0,one of the reasons I walked away from the Democratic Party liberalism is I'm so fed up with identity politics I am so fed up with political correctness I am so fed up with all ability and everyone here has already said it's lack of policy all identity heir Pete has been mentioned mayor Pete is gay he's been on the cover of magazines with his husband there's having somebody who's gay running right now does that make you want to vote for him mm-hmm I think you should vote on policy yeah I get asked that question all the time it's great to have a gay candidate be great table is being Kennedy or a trans candidate I'm looking at the policy everything else is peripheral I could not care less I mean the fact that he is gay doesn't I think there's such division in the LGBTQ or queer and trans whatever-you-call-it community between gay and trans trans and sis that doesn't mean he has my back as a trans person it doesn't mean that he will have trans affirming policy and supported those most marginalized in the trans community it means nothing to me that he is a gay person because he's also sis and he's also white and he's holding all of those identities and experiences at the same time so I would love to see some firm policy proposals that include trans people and non-binary people we haven't even talked about that yet but I haven't seen that yet I don't know why I'm not more excited about him than I am there's something missing I'm surprised that everybody is so anti Pete I mean I think I know a lot of sort of Pete curious conservatives is that I think you know I think he's very progressive but he's totally moderate and I think even just listening to us I mean everybody's so angry all the time to have somebody who is somewhat aspirational and who is trying to make a pitch for something something better and more they you know something more uniting like why is that so terrible I think it's I think it's nice but one of the reasons I walked away from the Democratic Party in liberalism is I'm so fed up with identity politics I am so fed up with political correctness I am so fed up with all of it in every as already said its lack of policy all identity and that's what he is I mean he's just a gay man with no ideas okay I hate when a lot of conservative folks well not even just conservative folks it's usually just white men across the aisle talk about I knew that was coming because like all identity politics right like you all have been moving through the world with your lens as a white man privileged in many different ways and therefore politics I black college I have never said that I'm not privileged I think we all have the capacity right so that's exactly what we're talking about right I also don't have this privilege and I don't have your privileges with me so like but yet matter you got no more life you don't know my experiences you're basic you're making an assumption about my life and my extreme not using for my stuff right my sexual orientation I know nor we know why not remedy is real never supposed to judge by the content of her character and not by the police I would love to stick to the Merapi question Bonnie I think having him out there and being visible is fantastic for for the community I have a nephew a 12 year old nephew who is a little gay boy and for him to be able to see that there is a gay man who is running for president is fantastic that's meaningful to you it's meaningful to have him there okay I don't I'd rather have a beer with him than vote for him Missy seems like you want to lean in and talk to him some more you know and his fabulous theater loving husband they sound great but okay I don't necessarily think that he's ready to run the country all right all right um so one thing that Jaime brought up was was the terms non-binary and GNC gender non-conforming how do you guys how does everybody here feel about the terms GNC gender non-conforming and non-binary and and the fact that it often falls under the umbrella of LGBTQ does anybody have any thoughts on that sure um so identify as non-binary and trans at the same time I believe non-binary is under the trans umbrella and not binary for me means that I don't identify as a man or a woman I'm neither I am both I am beyond and that has nothing to do with my body my body does not inform my gender I completely reject how non-binary people specifically have injected themselves into the trans label because at the end of the day I'm sure you're an amazing person you and I have wildly different experiences I am a transsexual there is a medical basis for that there's a scientific basis for that and for non-binary it's really not the case I think that non-binary is more of a political term than anything else which is why I've never met a non-binary Republican I'm very libertarian and it's it's clearly an invention of the left in general I also hate how non-binary people often because they tend to be the loudest politically they take over trans conversations I often see non-binary people in the media and on YouTube and on social media deciding what is right for trans people and transsexuals and I hate it because oftentimes it's not in alignment with most trans people I've actually met in my life so do you feel erased because of the term no no one can erase me like I'm I'm here you know what I mean but I mean in terms of them taking over the conversation oftentimes yes I think a lot of the reasons why conservatives and people who are not in the LGBTQ community have a hard time understanding trans people it often goes down to these talking points that were invented by non-binary people and people who are not trans who their lived experience could not be any more different than mine and so if it comes down to conversations about trans people I just wish actual transsexuals were having them and oftentimes it's activists who are non-binary I don't understand your argument that there's too much division that we don't have shared life experiences because among trans people among binary trans people who may go through medical tradition transition there is so much variance you are not a trans woman of color you are not a poor trans woman you have different experiences as a trans person that we need to talk about we cannot parse out at the exact same time to have this conversation yeah everything's nuanced but at the end of the day the a very fine line between someone who's a transsexual and grows up with gender dysphoria grows up saving up that money to get the confirmation surgery as they need going through coming out going through the hardships that specifically transsexuals face it is such a different life than someone who you don't know be my life I'm not saying that but what I'm but a lot of fighting people do not you can say you do and that's fine I completely believe you but a lot of them do not a lot of people a lot of non-binary people are the people who argued that you don't need gender dysphoria to be trans and to me that makes absolutely no sense because if you don't have that misalignment in your brain and misalignment in your body and within who you are then transmitting and I've never made that argument I my my support of the trans community always comes at me saying that they're their voices is important and I'm listening majority of the time I don't think the importance of a la ship is just to be in the listen mo and then I use my privilege where necessary if if they say that I need to because I know that I know I'm non-binary I know them gender expensive but I know how I present at the same time but um but but you also made a point that you said that you don't understand how non-binary people are making decisions on behalf of transgender people I think the number one you did kind of erase Jamie's when they said that they are non-binary and trans so let's start there and I think that also we we can we can say that about the whole Republican Party where we have majority white cisgender men making decisions on behalf of everyone do you have thoughts on this um I I don't identify as non-binary I can't speak to that lived experience but there are so many non-binary people that I know who identify that way who fit so so much of the gender spectrum if you will I know very feminine folks and very masculine folks folks were assigned female at birth so folks who are assigned male at birth some people have had hormones but no surgeries and some have had surgeries and no hormones and they're I mean I wouldn't know how else to describe that particular group without using the word non-binary because that's the word that they use so to say you know that the word non-binary is a creation of the left to cause division I I couldn't I couldn't necessarily it is I the political term it was born out of Gender Studies classes it wasn't born out of transsexual people saying well maybe this word works as well and that's that is my point is that I think you're the one that said that I was erasing you as trans I I am like you're not trans like there's a medical definition of being a transsexual and being but what if those not mattering people do you suffer from gender dysphoria Jaime how you do I mean that doesn't make you trans to just suffer from gender dysphoria being trans is having dinner dysphoria and acting upon it to live a life of sexual I think that's different I'm I'm gonna stop you Jaime how are you doing okay okay yeah do you feel like talking you don't have to okay Brendon can I can I say really quick but you know Terminator and actual and transgender were made up right they were clinical terms in a lot of ways initially so we can't use that as like a way of like demeaning people in our community I mean it's really unfortunate that we have to do that when we know outside of this room people don't see any of us or treat any of us with respect but you know why I think the large reason why a lot of people do not understand trans people is because of non-binary and because of all these other identities that we've all talked about are constantly tacked on to the acronym that always worked okay but how is it different when assists woman tells you this you're not a woman or for you to then tell Jaime that they're not friends Jaime you have something to say yes I think this argument has absurd this idea of you're creating more problems you're creating more division you're creating more confusion because that same argument has been used by gays and lesbians against trans people I think it sounds like another argument isn't an argument it doesn't mean it's invalid saying no but it's the exact same logic of saying we're trying to be part of the state you are making this too complicated and in working with the state I'm working with the Trump administration in order to create inclusivity you are erasing me and you're leaving me behind I don't believe in a politic that leaves people behind I say we start from the back see who is the most marginalized see what they need and get their needs first and then everyone explore it at the exact same time do you all feel welcomed by the LGBTQ community the LGBT community is very open to people who believe in the monolith that is known as the LGBTQ community that's interesting yeah I don't I don't think I don't think that they're accepting towards LGBT people with different viewpoints at all okay okay I had a very interesting experience two weeks ago at pride in West Hollywood my husband and I were at a restaurant I was wearing my hat and within a minute or so to women stormed our table and began cussing at me yawn it may screaming and one question like what do you think about gay marriage and I said well this is my husband so I'm for it how about the way he treats Mexicans and I said my name is Ramirez I'm mexican-american and I kind of shut them down with them they continued to yell and scream and try to incite the restaurant against us but I'm I think that the intelligent conversations I've had via the mag AHA have gone much further than the negative vitriol that that is inside of others so it's also a conversation starter fruits okay all right Raquel do you have thoughts on this I mean I think that there is merit in the conversation of not everyone feeling welcome I don't always feel welcome as a as a black trans woman in every space I still think a lot of the spaces that we have that are designated LGBTQ are so dominated by whites as gay men who tend to look a certain way and tend to move through the world in a certain way and bright and so on I find my most power in spaces that are specifically for black and brown trans folks and I you know I believe in that Tony how are you navigating through the LGBT community has been very fascinating for me because I used to feel very comfortable and lesbian bars and then when I started to present more masculine that kind of went away and actually one of my most recent experiences at a lesbian bar was being harassed and assaulted at a lesbian bar in New York City so that was like this crazy shake-up of my whole life changing and then as I mentioned I I am married to a cisgender woman and we were at Stonewall of all places and there was a table of I'm assuming I'm making assumption here sis gay men there who saw us kiss and it was like a cute little like hi baby kiss and we got the ill breeders when are you doing his Stonewall thing and it was like wow kid you have no idea first of all I could have birthed you and you know have been fighting for you know liberation gay liberation queer liberation for longer than you've been around but that's the assumption that they make based on what I look like now I can't believe that you've got 12 gay people here and nobody feels at home in the gay community a community I think and I think that speaks to look each of us has our own individual experiences right we're all humans who just want to like live in the world and and be accepted for who we are and that was sort of what the community used to be and I think part of what were suffering from is the difference between what it meant to be a community of people that was all across the spectrum to being apolitical shoehorned into a political movement you know the the idea that we all have to row in the same direction politically you know is is I think a problem for us as a community are there any questions that you would like to ask each other and if I could ask a question to Blair just to close to I'm curious what you think about the gender binary as a trans person who has experienced dysphoria and I also experienced dysphoria and I think the root of dysphoria and these feelings of transness is because there is a binary because there's a limiting construct social construct that tells people they can be one thing or the other that can be feminine or masculine and I think as a non-binary person non-binary people are actually in the front lines of deconstructing that binary and breaking down those systems of limitation and restriction that I think will allow all of us to be freer so I'm just curious like what what truly is your problem with me because I'm fighting for you I don't have a home with you personally I don't know anything about your life personally I would say well you said then about breaking down the binary but you're kind of just automatically assuming that that is in the best interest of trans people and that's what trans people want I personally have never met a transsexual or trans woman who thinks that that is the way to go in terms of getting acceptance from the larger and okay the first one and you're the first one I know you're miss understand what I say when I when I say break the binary I don't say like get rid of femininity get rid of masculinity get what a rid of women get rid of men I'm not saying that whatsoever I'm saying open up the options let people be and live and exist as their full authentic selves outside of these women I'm not here to limit anyone's options or say that you can't call yourself what you want I mean I have my wallet back I have an issue with trans people people that are not translating they're trans when they're not that's what I have an issue with because I don't have an issue with the non-binary label besides me thinking okay there's not really a ton of science behind it that's fine I don't like I don't like how in the beginning you said that non-binary you consider that to also be trans and that that falls under trans because I think I think that because I think that that again dilutes the message it D medicalize is it which i think is very very bad for trans people I think I'm fine Aryan people need medical intervention as well we need health care we need and that's fine and that's why I would say that I would hope that you guys would you know if you're going to advocate for that do it on behalf of yourselves and not try to squeeze into the tea label a label that historically we are still trying to get people to just understand and be halfway okay with and it doesn't help when 97 genders were squeezed into the tea label because the end of the day at the end of the day being trans is about for most trans people it is about I was born as a boy born as a girl and I identify as the other and what I find often times is this conversation really good example of how non-binary people really dominate the conversation about being trans is that I will get comments sometimes on my Instagram people accusing me of believing in 97 genders and and all those sort of things that are touted by non-binary people just because I'm trans that's a good example of how people don't know what trans is then because trans people are transitioning from one to the other I mean this is a conversation about language too because you're saying most trans people understand transition as a binary if you actually look at research 50% of trans youth identify as non-binary it's a growing community listen to angry but they were always there non-binary feeling something that stated before agree now there's nothing wrong about what you're doing you've just made it political I think that you have a very narrow definition of what trans is and then and that could be respected but that is that just doesn't work for you generalize a lot of trans people you say it for most parents - for most trans people and then I look to my left I'm almost finished so now I look to my left and she's like well she doesn't agree with you and also all of my trans sisters and all my trans brothers that I have in my life support me and they know I support them and they want me to come along with them on this journey as a non-binary person because they know that in order for any of us to be free we all have to be free so that's what that's where my perspective is under your perspective is different thank you for your free on thank you darling I hate it don't tell me what I am good I know that this conversation has been hard for some people I know that you're probably gonna go home and you're gonna think about this and I want to thank you for being here because it's not everybody who's willing to engage in these kinds of conversations this is a difficult thing to do and I have immense respect for each and every one of you for for showing up I really do so thank you so much thank you and with that thank you thank you I think we're gonna wrap this up my god I didn't even ask

I'M BRET BAIER. >> Martha: AND I MARTHA MacCALLUM. INCORPORATED YOU SO MUCH. GREAT TO HAVE EVERYBODY HERE. BEHIND US, AS YOU CAN SEE, IS THE NOW SHUTTERED BETHLEHEM STEEL PLANT. >> Bret: IN ITS HEYDAY THE BETHLEHEM STEEL PLANT BLASTS THOSE FURNACES AND PRODUCED THOUSANDS OF TONS OF STEEL A DAY. THAT STEEL BUILT SKYSCRAPERS AND HELPED THE U.S. WIN TWO WORLD WARS. THE PLANT CLOSED IN 1995. IT REALLY DEVASTATING WAS WORKING CLASS COMMUNITY. >> Martha: NOW THERE IS A NEW DAY DAWNING BETHLEHEM ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY. HERE IN NORTHAMPTON COUNTRY -- NORTHAMPTON COUNTY, WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE, THEY VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA IN BIG NUMBERS AND FOR THE DEMOCRAT ALL THE WAY BACK TO BUSH 41 ACTUALLY, BUT IT FLIPPED THE SCRIPT IN HIS COUNTY AND THEY VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP IN 2016 BY A SHIFT OF NINE POINTS. >> Bret: AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE ARE HERE. SENATOR SANDERS IS HOPING TO GET THOSE VOTERS BACK IN THE BLUE COLUMN. ACCORDING TO ALL RECENT POLLS, HE IS LEADING AMONG DECLARED DEMOCRAT CANDIDATES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. >> Senator Sanders: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. >> Bret: SENATOR, WE WANTED TO START -- WE WILL GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE, MARTHA AND I WILL FOLLOW UP THROUGHOUT. LET'S START BY GETTING WORK TO OUR AUDIENCE. OUR FIRST QUESTION IS FROM JOE. HE IS A STUDENT FROM ALLENTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA. WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION? >> HI, SENATOR SANDERS. NOW THAT YOUR TAX RETURNS HAVE BEEN RELEASED AND YOU HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A MILLIONAIRE AND IN THE TOP 1%, WILL YOU PAY YOUR FAIR SHARE, AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO APPLY THE POLICIES THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ENFORCING ON TOP EARNERS? THANK YOU, SENATOR SANDERS. >> Senator Sanders: I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE, JOE, THAT WE HAVE AN ABSURD TAX SYSTEM, AND WHILE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TODAY ARE PAYING ACTUALLY MORE IN TAXES THAN ANTICIPATED, AMAZON, NETFLIX, AND DOZENS OF MAJOR CORPORATIONS, AS A RESULT OF TRUMP'S TAX BILL, PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES. I THINK THAT'S A DISGRACE. SO TODAY -- YOU RAISED THE ISSUE I'M A MILLIONAIRE. ACTUALLY THIS YEAR WE HAD $560,000 INCOME. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY, AND THAT MONEY, IN MY CASE, MY WIFE'S CASE, IT CAME FROM A BOOK THAT I WROTE, PRETTY GOOD BOOK, YOU MIGHT WANT TO READ IT. BEST SELLER, BEST SELLER SOLD ALL OF THE WORLD, AND WE MADE MONEY. IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR WRITING A BEST-SELLING BOOK, I'M SORRY, I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. BUT LET ME REITERATE, I VOTED AGAINST -- I GUESS I'M FOX NEWS YOU SO THAT IT BENEFITED FROM TRUMP'S TAX BILL, DID YOU TELL PEOPLE I VOTED AGAINST TRUMP'S TAX BILL? SURE. >> Bret: BUT YOU DID BENEFIT FROM IT. >> Senator Sanders: BUT I VOTED AGAINST IT. AND I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT A TAX BILL WRITTEN AND PUSHED BY TRUMP, WHO TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THAT TAX BILL, SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL, WOULD NOT BENEFIT THE WEALTHY. DO REMEMBER THAT? NOT GOING TO BENEFIT THE WEALTHY. 83% OF THE BENEFITS WENT TO THE TOP 1%. I THINK THAT'S A BAD IDEA AND IN MY VIEW, PEOPLE, WHETHER IT'S ME, YOU, PROBABLY MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY THAN I DO, BUT WHETHER IT'S ME OR YOU ARE ANYBODY ELSE, I THINK WEALTHY PEOPLE AND LARGE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE MAKING BILLIONS OF PROFITS SHOULD START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. >> Bret: TO YOUR POINT, AND TO JOE'S POINT, YOUR TAXES TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE A MILLIONAIRE. YOU DID MAKE 1 MILLION IN 2016-2017. YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE 561 IN 2017-2018 FOR YOUR MARGINAL TAX RATE WAS 26% BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAX CUTS. WHY NOT SAY ON LEADING THIS REVOLUTION, GOING TO TAKE THIS? >> Senator Sanders: COME ON. I PAY THE TAXES THAT I OWE, AND BY THE WAY, WANT TO GET DONALD TRUMP UP HERE AND ASK THEM HOW MUCH HE PAYS IN TAXES. >> Bret: WE WILL. >> Senator Sanders: I AM AWAITING YOUR DOING THAT. >> Bret: WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THEM. >> Martha: WE ABSOLUTELY WILL. SPEECH REC IS THE PRESIDENT WATCHES YOUR NETWORK A BIT, RIGHT? HEY PRESIDENT TRUMP, MY WIFE AND I JUST RELEASED TEN YEARS. PLEASE DO THE SAME. LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW. >> Bret: JUST TO WRAP THAT UP, YOU DO SPEND A LOT OF TIME VILIFYING -- >> Senator Sanders: I DON'T VILIFY. THE FACT THAT I THINK PEOPLE ARE DOING PHENOMENAL AND     PHENOME DOING PHENOMENAL AND     PHENOMA DOING PHENOMENAL AND     PHENOML DOING PHENOMENAL AND     PHENOMY WELL, FOR FOUR YEARS WE HAVE BEEN A SHRINKING MIDDLE CLASS, 40 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY AND TODAY JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THE VERY WEALTHY ARE DOING INCREDIBLY WELL. IT'S NOT VILIFYING TO SAY THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY, AND SOME CASES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WEALTH, THEY SHOULD PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. I'M NOT VILIFYING. >> Bret: LAST QUESTIONS ON THIS. A LOT OF MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES GIVE A TIME TO CHARITY. YOU GAVE 3.4%. >> Senator Sanders: YEAH. MY WIFE AND I DO GIVE MONEY TO CHARITY. AND WE ARE PROUD TO DO WHAT WE DID. YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT. THERE ARE PEOPLE, GATES FOUNDATION, DO A PHENOMENAL JOB. WE DO WHAT WE DO. >> Martha: I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU. YOU RECOMMENDED A WELL TAX. 70% -- >> Senator Sanders: ACTUALLY I DIDN'T, THAT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE. I THINK ANOTHER PERSON. >> Martha: WHAT'S HER NUMBER? >> Senator Sanders: WHAT'S MY NUMBER? I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK. I THINK THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT ELDERLY PEOPLE DO NOT CONTINUE TO LIVE IN POVERTY AND YOU'VE GOT 20% OF ELDERLY PEOPLE TRYING TO GET BY ON 13,000 OR $14,000 A YEAR, I THINK WE SHOULD RAISE THAT GAP FOR PEOPLE MAKING $250,000 OR MORE SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OUR PARENTS CAN LIVE OUT THEIR LIVES IN DIGNITY. I WILL TELL YOU ELSE DOMINIC WOULD ALSO THINK. A TIME WHEN WALL STREET IS DOING PHENOMENALLY WELL AND WE HAVE MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WERE DEEPLY IN DEBT FOR THE CRIME OF HAVING GONE TO COLLEGE, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD PASS A SPECULATION TAX ON WALL STREET. >> Martha: THAT'S FINE, BUT I MET ASKING ABOUT THE WEALTHY AND HOW MUCH HIGHER YOU WOULD MAKE IT. YOU DON'T AGREE WITH 70%, WHAT WOULD YOUR NUMBER BE? >> Senator Sanders: IN THE CAMPAIGN OF 2016 WE TALKED ABOUT 52%. >> Martha: 52%, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PAY 52% ON THE MONEY MAY? YOU CAN VOLUNTEER. >> Senator Sanders: YOU CAN VOLUNTEER TOO. >> Martha: EVERYBODY IN YOUR BRACKET SHOULD DO. >> Senator Sanders: MARTHA, YOU MAKE MORE MONEY THAN I DO. WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT CONNECT >> Martha: I DIDN'T SUGGEST THE WEALTH TAX. >> Bret: AND SHE'S NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. >> Senator Sanders: WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR THE WEALTH TAX AND WE ARE GOING TO DEMAND THAT WE END THE ABSURDITY WERE MAJOR CORPORATION AFTER MAJOR CORPORATIONS -- DO YOU KNOW WHA WHAT? IN THIS TAX BILL THAT YOU ARE DEFENDING -- >> Martha: ARE NOT DEFENDING ANY TAXABLE, WE ARE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU PROPOSE. >> Senator Sanders: FAMILIES LIKE THE KOCH BROTHERS GET BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. THAT IS ABSURD. TRUMP WANTS TO REPEAL THE ENTIRE ESTATE TAX. HUGE TAX BREAKS FOR BILLIONAIRES. YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION? >> Bret: WE HAVE MANY QUESTIONS. >> Martha: WE HAVE MANY QUESTIONS ASKED LIKE >> Bret: WE WANT TO GET SUBSTANCE, WE WANT TO GET DETAIL. >> Senator Sanders: LET'S DO IT. >> Bret: THE AUDIENCE HAS A TON OF QUESTIONS TOO. >> Martha: ARE QUESTION COMES FROM KATHY HARRINGTON. KATHY, WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION? >> HI, SENATOR SANDERS GRADE WELCOME TO THE LEHIGH VALLEY. MY QUESTION IS THE DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM IS JUST A SOCIETY AGREEING TO WORK TOGETHER AND COMBINING THEIR RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS PROTECTED AND TAKEN HOW CAN YOU CHALLENGE THE IDEA THAT SOCIALISM IS BAD? IN THE MINDS OF THE PUBLIC? >> Senator Sanders: ASK THEM, NOT ME. >> Bret: IS THIS GOING TO BE A CONSTANT THING? >> Senator Sanders: NO. IT WILL NOT. >> Bret: ALL RIGHT. >> Senator Sanders: YOU ASK ME FOR QUESTIONS, I WILL GIVE YOU FOR ANSWERS. >> Bret: THANK YOU, SIR. >> Martha: THAT'S THE DEAL. >> Senator Sanders: NOT EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD COME ON THE SHOW. >> Bret: AND WE APPRECIATE IT. >> Senator Sanders: ALL RIGHT. YOUR NETWORK DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT, IN MY WORLD, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO BE HERE AND HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT SERIOUS ISSUES. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT. I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT WILL COME UP, WHAT IS DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM? FAIR QUESTION. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT. DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, TO ME, IS CREATING A GOVERNMENT AND AN ECONOMY AND A SOCIETY WHICH WORKS FOR ALL RATHER THAN JUST THE TOP 1%. IT MEANS ENDING THE ABSURD INEQUALITIES THAT EXIST TODAY AND I WANT TO LAY THIS OUT, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE AS MUCH ON FOX, AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS MUCH IN THE MEDIA IN GENERAL. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO CONCLUDE WHETHER WE THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE, AND WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT, HAVE THREE FAMILIES OWN MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM, HALF OF AMERICAN SOCIETY, 169 PEOPLE. WHETHER WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THE TOP 1% TO OWN MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM 92%. WHETHER IT IS RIGHT THAT 49% OF ALL THE INCOME GOES TO THE TOP 1%, WHEN MANY PEOPLE, BRET AND MARTHA, WERE WATCHING THIS PROGRAM, OR WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS JUST TO PAY THE BILLS. SO FIRST OF ALL, WE WANT TO CREATE A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US, AND WE WANT GREATER POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH IS BASED ON ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE, NOT BILLIONAIRES BUYING ELECTIONS AS A RESULT OF THIS DISASTROUS CITIZENS UNITED -- AND FURTHERMORE, FURTHERMORE, WHEN I TALKED -- PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF CAPITALISM OR DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, WHATEVER IT MAY BE, BUT THIS IS MY VIEW. I BELIEVE THAT HUMAN BEINGS, ESPECIALLY IN A WEALTHY DEMOCRATIC CIVILIZED SOCIETY LIKE OUR OWN, ARE ENTITLED TO CERTAIN BASIC RIGHTS. IF SO LET ME BE VERY CLEAR AND I'M SURE WE WILL DISCUSS IT LATER IN THE SHOW, BRET. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. AND I BELIEVE -- I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING EMBARRASSINGLY WRONG WHEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH NOT TO GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL PEOPLE. I LIVE 50 MILES FROM THE CANADIAN BORDER. >> Bret: WE WILL GET IN DETAIL ABOUT MEDICARE. >> Senator Sanders: HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT. I BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION, WHETHER POOR, WHETHER YOU'RE RICH, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO GET ALL OF THE EDUCATION YOU NEED, AND THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE WE SHOULD MAKE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TUITION-FREE. >> Bret: WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS AND WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT, WHICH IS A REAL QUESTION. >> Senator Sanders: ABSOLUTELY. >> Bret: BACK ON THE TAXES BRIEFLY. WHEN YOU WROTE THE BOOK AND YOU MADE THE MONEY, ISN'T THAT THE DEFINITION OF CAPITALISM AND THE AMERICAN DREAM? >> Senator Sanders: NO. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE WANT IS A COUNTRY WHERE EVERYBODY HAS OPPORTUNITY. I HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE. I'M A UNITED STATES SENATOR. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT UNITED STATES SENATORS. I WANT EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION SO WHEN THEY TURN ON THE WATER, HAVE DRINKABLE WATER, NOT TOXIC WATER. SO WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR, BRET, IS NOT A SOCIETY WHERE A FEW PEOPLE CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, BUT A SOCIETY WHERE EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN SECURITY AND DIGNITY. >> Martha: THIS WEEKEND, WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FIELD OF DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WHO ARE OUT THERE. THIS WEEKEND PETE BOOTED       B THIS WEEKEND PETE BOOTED       T THIS WEEKEND PETE BOOTED       I THIS WEEKEND PETE BOOTED       G THIS WEEKEND PETE BOOTED       , THIS WEEKEND PETE BOOTED       T THIS WEEKEND PETE BOOTED       E MAYOR OF SOUTH BEND ANNOUNCED HE IS ALSO A CANDIDATE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. HE IS RUNNING. AND HERE'S WHAT HE SAID IN SOUTH BEND. >> A MOMENT LIKE THAT CALLS FOR HOPEFUL AND AUDACIOUS VOICES FROM COMMUNITIES LIKE OURS, AND YES, IT CALLS FOR A NEW GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY. >> Martha: SO BUTTIGIEG OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN THE YOUNGEST CANDIDATE -- HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE THE YOUNGEST PRESIDENT IF HE WERE TO WIN AT 37 YEARS OLD, AND YOU ARE 77 YEARS OLD. HE'S CALLING FOR A NEW GENERATION. HE DIDN'T NAME ANYONE SPECIFICALLY, BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO HAVE RAISED THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD BE TO ALL THAT 79 AS PRESIDENT? >> Senator Sanders: FOLLOW ME AROUND THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. MARTHA, IT IS A FAIR QUESTION. IT'S A FAIR QUESTION AND ALL I CAN SAY IS IF THERE WAS WHAT HE OR I WOULD KNOCK ON THE GREATEST THANK GOD MY HEALTH IS GOOD. WHEN I WAS A KID I WAS A LONG DISTANCE RUNNER, ONE OF THE BETTER MILERS IN NEW YORK CITY AND CONTINUE TO HAVE MY ENDURANCE. BUT I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT A CANDIDATE, YEAH, YOU CAN LOOK AT IT, THAT'S FAIR. YOU CAN LOOK AT EXPERIENCE. I WAS A MAYOR FOR EIGHT YEARS, A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I WAS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE, I'M A MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD TALKING TO HEADS OF STATE. SO I MEAN I THINK IT IS A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, BUT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS WHAT I HONESTLY BELIEVE, IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU'RE YOUNG, NOT WHETHER YOUR OLD, IT IS WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN. AND I HAVE TO SAY -- AND I HAVE TO SAY, THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM OF FOX, THIS IS A CRITICISM OF MEDIA IN GENERAL. THERE IS TOO MUCH FOCUS ON INDIVIDUALS AND NOT IN A ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU -- AGAIN, THIS IS NOT JUST FOX, THIS IS ALL THE REST. I GO OUT AND I LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE AND THEY SAY -- THEY ASKED ME QUESTIONS, THOSE QUESTIONS ARE OFTEN VERY, VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE ISSUES BEING DISCUSSED BY MEDIA ON CAPITOL HILL. >> Bret: WE WANT TO GET BACK TO AUDIENCE QUESTIONS. I DO WANT TO SAY WE UNDERSTAND AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE. WE ARE GIVING YOU AN HOUR OF SUBSTANCE AND TALK ON OUR AIRWAVES, SO WE CAN GET OVER THE FOX THING. IF YOU'RE ALL     ALL RIGHT WITH IF YOU'RE ALL     ALL RIGHT WITT IF YOU'RE ALL     ALL RIGHT WITA IF YOU'RE ALL     ALL RIGHT WIT. OKAY. BRIAN IS A CITY COUNCILMAN HERE IN BETHLEHEM. WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION? GO AHEAD, BRIAN. HOLD ON ONE SECOND, BRIAN HAS GOT THE FLOOR. >> SENATOR SANDERS -- >> Senator Sanders: WHERE IS BRIAN? >> AS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL, WELCOME TO THE CITY, MY QUESTION IS AS A LIFELONG KENNEDY DEMOCRAT, MORE SPECIFICALLY CENTER LEFT, MY CONCERN IS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SO INFLAMED THE DEMOCRATIC BASE THAT WE WILL SHIFT TO FAR LEFT AND OVERREACHED THE COMIC LIKE THE REPUBLICANS DID WITH THE TEA PARTY IN 2010, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? >> Senator Sanders: GOOD QUESTION. THIS IS WHAT I SAY EVERY DAY. I DISAGREE WITH DONALD TRUMP ON VIRTUALLY EVERY ISSUE, AND I TALK ABOUT IT, AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT UPSETS ME -- BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT UPSETS ME THE MOST, AND I'M GOING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, IS THAT WHETHER YOUR CONSERVATIVE OR MODERATE OR PROGRESSIVE, I DON'T THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE PROUD THAT WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WAS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR. AND I SAY THAT -- IT DOES NOT GIVE ME PLEASURE TO SAY THAT. I DISAGREED WITH GEORGE W. BUSH ON ALMOST EVERYTHING. BUSH WAS NOT A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR. TRUMP CANNOT EVEN TELL THE TRUTH EVEN AS TO WHERE HIS FATHER WAS BORN. REALLY THAT CRAZY, HIS FATHER WAS BORN IN NEW YORK, HE CLAIMS HE WAS BORN IN GERMANY, BUT IF YOU CAN EVEN TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHERE YOUR FATHER WAS BORN, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT HE SAYS. BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, LOOK, IF WE SPEND ALL OF OUR TIME ATTACKING FROM, YOU KNOW WHAT, DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO LOSE. ALL RIGHT? OUR JOB -- OUR JOB IS TO LAY OUT A VISION THAT MAKES SENSE TO THE WORKING FAMILIES OF THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO. OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD, AND THE VIDEO THAT YOU SHOWED EARLIER, I THINK CAPTURED THAT, WE RAISED ISSUES FOUR YEARS AGO WHICH WERE THOUGHT TO BE EXTREME AND A LITTLE BIT OUT THERE, BUT TODAY THERE ARE ACCEPTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SO I THINK YOU TALK TO THE PEOPLE OF BETHLEHEM AND BURLINGTON, VERMONT, AND YOU SAY WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? YOU KNOW WHAT? AMONG OTHER THINGS, IF YOU WORK 40 HOURS A WEEK, PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN POVERTY. WITH GOT TO RAISE THAT MINIMUM WAGE TO A LIVING WAGE. IN MY STATE OF VERMONT AND ALL OF THIS COUNTRY WITH GOT AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS FALLING ABOUT, ROADS AND BRIDGES AND WATER SYSTEMS, WE COULD PUT 50 MILLION PEOPLE BACK TO WORK WITH A TRILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. IT DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO PEOPLE? SO I AGREE WITH YOU. I THINK TRUMP IS A DANGEROUS PRESIDENT, BUT IF ALL WE DO IS FOCUS ON HIM, WE LOSE. OUR JOB IS TO DEVELOP AN AGENDA THAT SPEAKS TO THE NEEDS OF WORKERS. WHEN WE DO THAT WE ARE GOING TO WIN AND WIN BIG. >> Martha: SENATOR, IT LOOKS LIKE -- AND NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS LIKELY TO GET INTO THE RACE. ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THE DNC, THAT HE WOULD BE A STRONG ESTABLISHMENT CANDIDATE, OBVIOUSLY BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME, ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THE DNC MIGHT PUT ITS FINGER ON THE SCALE AGAIN THE WAY THAT THEY DID TO YOU BACK IN 2016 WITH HILLARY CLINTON? >> Senator Sanders: ARE RIGHT, WE WENT THROUGH THAT IN 2016 AND I THINK WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY SINCE THEN. WE SPEAK TO THE DNC EVERY WEEK AND I THINK THE PROCESS WILL BE FAIR. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT WE MAKE AND WE WANT IS, AS YOU RECALL, BOTH OF YOU WILL RECALL, AND THE LAST TIME AROUND IN 2016, SECRETARY CLINTON HAD 500 SUPERDELEGATES LINED UP BEHIND HER BEFORE THE FIRST VOTE WAS CAST IN IOWA, AND THAT SEEMED TO ME PRETTY DUMB AND UNFAIR. THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN CHANGED AND I THINK THAT WORKS WELL FOR EVERYBODY. >> Martha: LET ME ASK YOU, BECAUSE NOW THE PROCESS IS THAT IN THE NEXT ROUND THE SUPERDELEGATES WILL COME INTO PLAY AND WITH SO MANY CANDIDATES ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET 50%. ARE YOU CONCERNED -- ARE YOU TALKING TO THE DNC ABOUT THAT? >> Senator Sanders: THAT'S WHAT THE RULE IS. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. I WOULD HOPE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY DIDN'T SOME YEARS AGO, AND THAT IS WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU IS NOT POLITICAL INSIDERS AND CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTORS. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM ORDINARY PEOPLE IN IOWA AND PENNSYLVANIA, AND THEY SHOULD DETERMINE WHO THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WILL BE. >> Bret: LET'S GO TO ANOTHER QUESTION. JORDAN, A STUDENT FROM SCOTCH PLAINS. HE HAS THE NEXT QUESTION. >> HI, SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. MY QUESTION IS WHY HE BELIEVED THE GOVERNMENT CAN PROVIDE BETTER HEALTH CARE FOR THEM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WASH PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE PLANS BE FORCED TO SWITCH? >> Senator Sanders: OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, LET'S BE CLEAR WHAT WE MEAN BY MEDICARE FOR ALL. OKAY? MEDICARE IS A GOVERNMENT-RUN PROGRAM FOR SENIORS, WHICH IS WIDELY POPULAR AND QUITE EFFECTIVE. IN 1965 WHEN LYNDON JOHNSON PASSED THAT BILL, IT WAS CALLED BY SOME REPUBLICANS SOCIALISM IN EVERY THING ELSE BUT YOU GO TO THE AVERAGE SENIOR NEWS AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MEDICARE, AND THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY WILL OPPOSE ANY REPUBLICAN EFFORT TO CUT MEDICARE, AND BY THE WAY, AND TRUMP'S BUDGET, HE HAS PROPOSED AN $845 BILLION CUT OVER A 10-YEAR PERIOD MEDICARE, WHICH SENIORS DON'T WANT TO. SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION AND MOST VETERANS THINK THAT THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, TALK TO THE AMERICAN LEGION AND THE VFW, THEY STRONGLY DEFEND THE VETERANS HEALTH CARE. THAT'S GOVERNMENT-RUN. WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS SIMPLY A SINGLE-PAYER INSURANCE PROGRAM, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WILL HAVE A CARD WHICH SAYS MEDICARE ON IT, YOU WILL GO TO ANY DOCTOR THAT YOU WANT, YOU WILL GO TO ANY HOSPITAL THAT YOU WANT, AND BY THE WAY, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TODAY ARE IN NETWORKS WHICH PREVENT THEM FROM DOING THIS, SO THIS GIVES YOU FREEDOM OF CHOICE WITH REGARD TO THE DOCTORS YOU GO TO FOR THE HOSPITALS YOU GO TO, BUT HERE IS THE MAIN POINT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE. RIGHT NOW WITH GOT 30 MILLION PEOPLE, ZERO HEALTH INSURANCE, AND MANY OF YOU AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE UNDER-INSURED WITH HIGH DEDUCTIBLES AND CO-PAYS, IS THAT CORRECT? ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE ARE ESTIMATES THAT SOME 30,000 AMERICANS DIE EVERY SINGLE YEAR BECAUSE THEY DON'T GO TO THE DOCTOR WHEN THEY SHOULD. MEANWHILE, WE PAY THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, 1 OUT OF 5 AMERICANS ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF BY THE DRUG COMPANIES WHO MAKE BILLIONS IN PROFITS WHILE CHARGING US THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD, AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, WE SPEND TWICE AS MUCH PER CAPITA ON HEALTH CARE AS DO THE PEOPLE OF ANY OTHER NATION SO THE QUESTION A THROWBACK TO, DO YOU THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO SPEND TWICE AS MUCH PER CAPITA AS THE PEOPLE OF ANY OTHER NATION AND BE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD NOT TO GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL PEOPLE? >> Bret: THIS AUDIENCE HAS A LOT OF DEMOCRATS IN IT. IT HAS REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS, CONSERVATIVES. I WANT TO ASK THE AUDIENCE A QUESTION, IF YOU COULD RAISE OR HINDER, SHOW OF HANDS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE GET THEIR INSURANCE FROM WORK, PRIVATE INSURANCE, RIGHT NOW? HOW MANY GET IT FROM PRIVATE INSURANCE? OKAY. OF THOSE, HOW MANY ARE WILLING TO TRANSITION TO WHAT THE SENATOR SAYS, A GOVERNMENT-RUN SYSTEM? 180 MILLION PEOPLE IN PRIVATE INSURANCE. THEY WOULD BE LOST, RIGHT? TO YOUR SYSTEM. >> Senator Sanders: FAIR QUESTION. LET ME ANSWER IT. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE YEAR LOSE THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. IF YOU KNOW I? THEY GET FIRED OR THEY QUIT AND THEY GO TO ANOTHER EMPLOYER. I WAS A MAYOR FOR EIGHT YEARS. WHAT I DID PROBABLY EVERY MAYOR IN AMERICA DOES, JUST LOOK AROUND FOR THE BEST INSURANCE PROGRAM, THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE INSURANCE. IF YOU CHANGE INSURANCE. EVERY YEAR MILLIONS OF WORKERS WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND THEIR EMPLOYER HAS CHANGED THE INSURANCE THAT THEY HAVE. MAYBE THEY LIKED THE DOCTORS -- PEOPLE ARE NODDING THEIR HEADS. OKAY, SO THIS IS NOT NEW. EVERY YEAR. WHAT WE ARE TALKING BUT ACTUALLY IS STABILITY, THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A MEDICARE FOR ALL, IT IS THERE NOW, IT IS THERE IN THE FUTURE. >> Martha: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT VERMONT, BECAUSE VERMONT TRIED TO HAVE A SINGLE-PAYER PROGRAM AND IN 2014 THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR ABANDON IT BECAUSE HE HAD TO RAISE INCOME TAXES, HAD TO RAISE PAYROLL TAXES AND THE PEOPLE OF VERMONT DIDN'T WANT THEIR TAXES TO GO UP. >> Senator Sanders: THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE. >> Martha: THEY ABANDON THE PROGRAM. >> Senator Sanders: INTERNAL VERMONT POLITICS OF WHICH I KNOW A LITTLE BIT. >> Martha: I'M SURE YOU DO. >> Senator Sanders: THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR DID A RATHER POOR JOB. IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING ESPECIALLY AMONG DEMOCRATS, YOU TELL ME, STRONG MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS, AND MORE THAN A FEW REPUBLICANS WANT TO SEE A MEDICARE FOR ALL PROGRAM. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH HEALTH CARE, WHICH IS, WHAT IS IT, 18% OF OUR GDP? TALKING ABOUT THREE AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND YOU HAVE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT MAKE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFIT, LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, IF I MIGHT, OF THE DYSFUNCTIONALITY OF THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. RECENTLY, AETNA MERGED WITH CPS, BIG MERGER, WHICH MIND YOU, WILL DRIVE HEALTH CARE COSTS UP. THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS HEAD OF AETNA, AND YOU KNOW HE GOT FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THAT MERGER? HE GOT A $500 MILLION BONUS. TO THINK THAT'S HOW WE SHOULD SPEND HEALTH CARE DOLLARS? >> Martha: I THINK EVERYBODY IS IN AGREEMENT THAT HEALTH CARE NEEDS TO BE FIXED IN THIS COUNTRY, THE QUESTION IS HOW, AND MY QUESTION TO YOU WAS, IT WILL DRIVE UP TAXES TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE, AND NOT JUST THE WEALTHY WILL PAY FOR THAT, THE MIDDLE CLASS WILL ALSO PAY FOR IT. >> Senator Sanders: VERY GOOD. >> Martha: HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY IT? >> Senator Sanders: MARTHA, WHAT ARE YOU NOT INCLUDING IN YOUR DISCUSSION? >> Martha: YOU TELL ME. >> Senator Sanders: I WILL TELL YOU. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PAY ANY HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS. >> Martha: YOU'RE GOING TO PAY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. >> Senator Sanders:            H >> Senator Sanders:            T >> Senator Sanders:            S >> Senator Sanders:            O >> Senator Sanders:            R >> Senator Sanders:            I >> Senator Sanders:            C >> Senator Sanders:            M >> Senator Sanders:            E >> Senator Sanders:            T >> Senator Sanders:            X OR PAYROLL TAX. >> Senator Sanders: HEALTH CARE IS NOT FREE. >> Martha: OF COURSE NOT, YOU JUST SAID IT'S GOING TO BE FREE FOR EVERYONE. >> Senator Sanders: IS GOING TO BE FREE OF THE POINT OF WHEN YOU USE IT, OKAY? WHY ARE YOU SO SHOCKED BY THIS? >> Martha: BECAUSE SOMEONE'S GOING TO PAY. >> Senator Sanders: SOMEBODY IS GOING TO PAY. >> Martha: WHO ARE THEY? >> Senator Sanders: LET ME TALK. IT WILL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. >> Martha: IT'S A COMMON QUESTION. >> Senator Sanders: OKAY. HERE WE GO. >> Martha: SO MANY QUESTIONS, ASK SENATOR SANDERS HOW HE IS GOING TO PAY? >> Senator Sanders: I GOT IT. LET'S JUST SAY HYPOTHETICALLY, YOU ARE SELF-EMPLOYED AND YOU'VE GOT A HUSBAND AND TWO KIDS, OKAY? FAMILY OF FOUR COMING TO KNOW HOW MUCH THAT FAMILY IS PAYING TODAY FOR HEALTH CARE? >> Martha: TELL ME. >> Senator Sanders: $20,000. $11,000 PER PERSON. WHERE THINK OF THAT FAMILY BEFORE YOU AREN'T GOING TO PAY MORE THAN 20,000. YOU'RE NOT PAYING ANY MORE COPAYMENTS, MORE PREMIUMS, ANYMORE DEDUCTIBLES. HOW IS THAT? 28,000 YOU ARE NOT PAIN, BUT DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PAY SOMETHING CANNOT OF COURSE IT DOES. YOU'RE GOING TO PAY MORE IN TAXES. >> Bret: MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WE NOW HAVE GOLD PLATED HEALTH INSURANCE -- >> Senator Sanders: NO WE DON'T. >> Bret: HAVE A SPECIAL PLAN THAT'S OUTSIDE OF OBAMACARE, A DIFFERENT PLAN. TWO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, ARE THEY GOING TO DO THE TRANSITION AS WELL? >> Senator Sanders: DAMN RIGHT RIGHT. OF COURSE. I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT -- I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE POINT THAT MARTHA RAISED. LOOK, HEALTH CARE COSTS MONEY. EVERY OTHER COUNTRY, VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTRY DOES IT IN THE SAME WAY WE DO EDUCATION FOR OUR KIDS. OKAY? WHEN A KID WALKS INTO SCHOOL, THE KID DOESN'T HAVE TO TAKE OUT A CREDIT CARD, RIGHT? IT GETS PAID FOR OUT OF PUBLIC FUNDS. THAT'S WHAT MOST COUNTRIES DO. IF YOU'RE ASKING ME -- IT'S A FAIR QUESTION, ARE PEOPLE GOING TO PAY MORE IN TAXES? YES. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO END UP PAYING LESS"
0,"JESS:
  When I was nine years old, my parents got
  English teaching jobs and moved us all
  to Japan for a year. I was a blonde kid, and that made me of interest
  to all the Japanese people like 'cos they had
  never really seen a blonde-haired person before. (piano playing) JESS: They would point
  at me or my sister, touch my hair, talk at me-
  I didn't understand
  anything yet. JESS:
  The day after we arrived I went to school for the first
  time and then that was crazy. JESS:
 I didn't feel that anyone was interested
 in getting to know me, except for one person
 and her name was Fukue, and we became best of friends. JESS: She was really
  curious about me and that made me
  really curious about her because she was so
  different from everyone else. We'd go down the dirt roads,
 we'd explore the little shrines. We would find frogs
  in the rice paddies. JESS: She was
 the closest friend that I had, and she was a creative,
 beautiful human. After a year in Japan,
 my family returned to Vancouver. Fukue and I became
  pen pals immediately. And then all of a sudden,
 I just stopped hearing from her. At the time, I just wondered
  if something prevented her from writing to me or if she
  stopped of her own will. JESS: Fukue was my
  surrogate family at school, and I protected her
  from the bullies. Now that we were apart, I was scared that the bullying
  had started again. JESS: Years later, when I
 became a professional musician, I reconnected with the koto,
  and that made me think a lot about my time in Japan
  and Fukue. This song is called
  'Lost Friends' and I hope one day to find her. (drum beating) JESS:
 Scarf. Guitar. Chord. JESS: So, I started
  looking online for Fukue. There was no record of her name, There was no social media
  accounts, no photos. Nothing. In the back of my mind,
  I was always worried that something bad
  had happened to her. So, I'm going back to Japan to
 see if I can try and find Fukue. The most important
  thing for me to say to her is how much she meant to me, and that how much
  she affected my life, and showed me some important
  lessons about humanity. I might not be able to follow
  the trail to anything that is current, but maybe
  Fukue is still out there. (accordion music) JESS: The place that we
  ended up living is a little town called Saku. So Saku is referred to
  as the boonies by Japanese people. Dirt roads, rice paddies
  everywhere, little shrines... We were so notable as a family that we were asked
  to be the stars of an educational video to teach
  Japanese kids English. But that was of course when Saku
  had absolutely no foreigners and it was a small,
  rural village. It's now a regular city
  of 100,000 people, so finding Fukue
  is going to be a lot harder than it would
  have been before. JESS: Wow, this is what
 it looked like, for sure. This is what
 everything looked like. The first place I'm going to go is the school that Fukue
  and I went to as kids. I have a meeting set up
  with the principal, and I'm really hoping he can
  give me some information that leads us to finding her. JESS: The morning of
 the Halloween party me and Fiona woke up at 6:10
 we put away our futon Made breakfast and ate it after we had prepared
 and carved the pumpkin children had started to come. Ah Halloween! JESS:
 Halloween party also. JESS: So when Fukue and I
  would play after school, she would always come
  to my apartment. The only time that I actually
  came face-to-face
  with that thought was when I was formally
  invited to come to her house. When I got to the place,
  it wasn't a house at all- it was like a shack, basically. It was poverty. JESS: I remember just
  standing outside the house, not knowing what to do. Before anyone inside saw me,
  I just ran back home. Just realizing that
  my best friend lived in this type
  of a situation, and all of the things
  that I'd heard, coming around the corner
  at school and seeing kids surrounding her
  and pointing at her and clearly saying
  something not nice to her even though
  I couldn't hear it. JESS: What I saw that day
  has never left my mind's eye. JESS: Is there anything else
 that comes up here? I see Iwamurada. JESS : I still sort of
  speak Japanese like a kid, so I've brought along
  a translator and guide, Ryo, to help out. JESS: We're looking at
 the yearbook I picked up from the school, and it shows the father's name
 of every student. So we looked that up online and
 we found a record from 2000, which is 11 years later than
 our nearest other record so that's like
 an improvement. Even if he has passed and so his
 number isn't listed any more, his wife might still live there
 or maybe his son lives there. Maybe she lives there. I think we should go to the
 personal residence address that's listed. RYO:
 93 2-10. JESS:
 Ooh. Here we go! It just feels good to do
 detective work, exactly. It's kind of like
 my childhood dream. All my childhood dreams
 meshing together in one trip! JESS: Dammit!
 This is definitely all new. RYO: According to the map,
 it's probably this house. JESS:
 Right. Like this one. JESS: You know we probably
 should have asked those women. JESS:
 Oh really! Really! Wow! JESS: I can't believe
  that when we got to City Hall that there was a full press
  conference waiting for me. The most important thing
  about the press being here is that it makes me
  really hopeful that we're actually
  going to find Fukue. JESS:
 Fukue-san. I want to find you. (dramatic music) (cell phone ringing) RYO:
 (speaking Japanese) JESS:
 Okay, great. RYO:
 (speaking Japanese) JESS:
 Yes, please. JESS: So now,
 like we gotta call her. JESS: I don't think I actually
 thought that this would happen. Like, I hoped but... JESS: I always felt
  I left Fukue behind, knowing her life
  in Saku was not easy. She never said anything to me
  about hard things were. She was strong
  way beyond her years. JESS: She could
  be using her intelligence and her creativity,
  and having a wonderful life. She might
  have a family, she might have accomplished
 all of her goals. But on the flip side, maybe
 she doesn't have a good life- that would be a crazy
 smack in the face of reality. (telephone ringing) JESS :
  I became emotional immediately when I came to this city because
  it only existed in my memory and in my imagination. And then along with that came
 this idea that like those times were a time
  I could never access again and the most important person
  to me from that time of course was Fukue. We just got
 along so well again and easily. It was so natural.
  It's just unreal. She has a steady job,
  a husband that loves
  her so much, and two awesome kids. I think she loves
  her life, and I think she has
  a wonderful life. I'm so happy
  that even though she had to drop out
  of elementary school, she's been able to get to
  where she is today. It's like definitely
  renewed my belief in things turning out
  in the way that is right. JESS :
  Now that I'm back home, Fukue and I are going to
  keep in touch regularly, like we did when
  we were kids. She went through
  such a rough childhood, and the fact that
  she is where she is, despite what she was
  up against, makes me so happy. (dramatic music)"
0,what is it fair to say that art isn't its dealing with the abstracts it's a representation of something that wouldn't be present and we're not for the conduit of the artist unless it's very representational art of like here is an apple well I mean the I think that the fascinating thing about art is that it is open to interpretation and even an artist making their best attempt to replicate what's happening in in the world you know realistically there's always some translation that has the the essence of the artist imbued in the final product and for example the Ramones were huge fans of Phil Spector sixties pop and they liked the chance of the Bay City Rollers yet filtered through their Sensibility you get blitzkrieg bop which is quite chanta below let's go but doesn't sound like any of those influences so the act of creating just because you are you and not someone else it's always going to have some sort of distinct mutation in it which is such a beautiful thing it allows people to put something out into the world that's that's uniquely theirs and it's sad that a lot of people think that they need to copy what is what seems most commercially viable because they're there then stifling where that mutation can really bring about something incredible but it's it's always gonna have something of them in it and I think that you know I'm a big I'm a big fan of studying art and design history and knowing what's going on but then being purely analytical about how to create something new and not be derivative that's that that's basically an exercise that's going to paralyze most people because we're all inspired and to let it just what you're inspired by consciously or subconsciously flow through you and then manifest in something that you create by just doing it it's almost like you know the Ralph Macchio not realizing that the brushstrokes were gonna make him better at karate from mr. Miyagi the yeah for all of you that are old enough to know Karate Kid the you know this this thing that happens when you just do it all the time you get better and you know there been a lot of things that I you know found that with whether it was playing playing pool or DJing but you know art is something I'm so much enjoy the visual problem-solving that it doesn't feel like I'm kind of doing my my calisthenics it just is an enjoyable process for me but you just can't help but get better when you do something all the time so that's what I say to people that say I have I have creative block right now like don't think too hard just trust your gut make it and then be a good editor at the end of the process if you haven't achieved what you were hoping to achieve learn from what went well in that process and what didn't go well in that process and and look at it as nothing is a waste of time there was a valuable lesson in even the failures did you do any teaching I used to be the teacher's assistant when I was at wrote the Rhode Island School of Design for screen printing and I enjoyed that especially I enjoyed that a lot of cute girls would say you're a better teacher than the teacher because I thought maybe I could read something else into that as well which was really flattering but um but I think it really was just that I was a better useless since it could never be transferred into actual adulation that's good because that idea that the value of authenticity is that you gain access to your own particular mutations your own particular essence in spite of whatever influences you like you may have been in place and getting you to the point where you at least know the vocabulary there and grammar of what it is you're attempting to do I think that's a vital one and I like what you said there about knots of dwelling on the problem of creative block but being willing just to it's kind of trust a certain flow that seems like that's a very productive technique or at least attitude well you know I've watched a lot of interviews of yours and I've read a lot but when I read you know a couple of yearbooks and found now that you had more or less dictated those all in short order I mean you know not every not everyone's capable of that sort of thing but I think that you have the capacity to do that you you must appreciate the the idea that you don't overthink it you start doing it and then you refine as you go you just don't have to go through as many rounds of revision as most people yeah if you prepare if you've prepared yourself if you've done the necessary rituals and the necessary study and the necessary practice then it feels to me more through performance than writing although I say it's present in both communicative forms a sense that there is a you there is a pre-existing flow that you align yourself with and if you get of the way that flow can come through you and even in things that I'm not good at and I'm learning like no ibly the martial art resilient jujitsu sometimes I feel when I see people that are good at it is as if jujitsu exists as a Platonic ideal and people that are willing to do the Disciplinary work are able to plug in to this concrete yet external thing or transcendent maybe think or do Jitsu and there it is you can light up the grid on it whereas I'm like so fumbling for threads from fumbling to put clumsily put together little individual sort of bolts of scene taxes I sort of fumble through it and I'm I suppose you now you've had you've been practicing for so long even present with it so long thanks for watching this podcast and going all the way to the end of it was use it kind of to click the Belmont up a little over there and they're subscribing so that we can infiltrate your serenity and peace of mind with jangling bells and parties thank you
0,if you are feeling not good enough it is hardly surprising because you might be watching this on a social media platform that does present you with many images that are hmm with which you unfavorably compare I heard from Brenda Brown that women use body image to berate themselves men use weakness to berate themselves on often we recognize that the media runs on using comparative images of both of the sixes or those two sixes if that's your way of seeing things that we compared unfavorably to beautiful images of women strong men and we're both both of those genders are left feeling shortchanged by virtue of their comparison you might not feel good enough because you like you know it's like feeling not good enough suggests that there's an ideal there's an ideal version of yourself and I happen to think that that's kind of true as in there is a latent potential we will grow to a certain height we can achieve certain musculature we can achieve certain levels of consciousness but we consume so much negative product so much negative beta I had to be honest and quite cautious about the way I use media like I try not to look at too much social media because I don't want to read people being negative or criticizing or gossiping or attacking me I don't like looking at other people's lives because I sometimes feel like I'm not good enough as a result of that but of course like any tool it can be positively used to create connection and to convey positive and helpful information it's partly what I'm trying to do as a matter of fact is just speak about things that's beneficial that give you the opposite feeling the feeling of you are good enough that you are worthy of love that you are capable of achieving the things that you want to achieve although you may need to address those things look at the reasons why you want to achieve them what are the areas of your life that you don't feel good enough in your relationships your work your Anatomy I've felt inferior in all of those areas on loads of occasions it's gotten getting a lot easier it gets a lot easier the more I focus on helping other people to tell you the truth the more time I spend talking to other people about their problems giving them suggestions and examples of how they might address some of those challenges or sometimes if I don't know just being loving to other people if my purpose becomes to love others and the feeling that I'm not good enough it recedes and on occasion entirely evaporates part of the not feeling good enough in my opinion is a continual campaign for self fulfillment through the pursuing of external goals even if it's an external image of yourself you are good enough when people say the world is an illusion they're right you know it's temporary it may even literally be holographic it certainly is only one aspect of a reality that is likely more complex than we are capable of understanding and is the best lack of capability that prevents it from ever being understood I mean to say we fought the earth was flat now we know the world is fear achill perhaps in generations they'll say wow they didn't know that there were all these different frequencies of reality but you could access all these parallel dimensions that humans can inhabit now we know this how foolish they were to not feel good enough difficult to be somewhere between an ape and a divine creature isn't it I find it strange sometimes I'm in my monkey mindful of my monkey needs and monkey requirement other times a real bliss of connection other time the pain of being person that has spiritual longing and yearning the way to free yourself from not feeling good enough is to recognize that the standard that you're trying to appeal to if not is is if not arbitrary certainly a construction of some kind there is no absolute total version of a person that we're comparing ourselves to even if you're religious and people I want to be more like Christ or more like Muhammad or more like the Buddha or more like you know what's that Chinese when she's called I think he's young I can't remember a name you know she's the mother you'll tell me in answers to this nice to have an idol or a saint to aspire to but to also recognize that these energies these humors these saintly attributes are latent within us so possibly that feeling that you're not good enough is it part of you communicating to your conscious mind that there are things to aspire to but it won't be achieved through flat abs although I love a flat ad when I'm watching a violin don't look at their lovely flat abs and it won't be achieved through money because it's it's unbelievably abstract and it won't be achieved through the pewte sex or the consuming of drugs the road of excess doesn't leave to lead to the palace of wisdom because you realize that excess is not the answer you've shed a lot on the way if you feel not good enough be careful what you consume here be careful what you look at online be careful how you participate be careful how you indulge for those moments within you became allow you attached and misery and pain it's very easy to get quite connected to it like when I see real suffering and we were sadness sometimes I only want to possess it parasite off it but I recognize my role is to be supportive nourishing and encouraging not to try and Owen have the people's pain and when I'm in my pain because of my own perception because what I believe I should have I remember that I don't know anything there's nothing to rightly compare it to and finally if you are of service to others you naturally begin to feel better hello I'm doing new videos more frequently now please hit the notification

not an option you cover one eye with your hand and raise the other arm in the air to alert maintenance that you are not well also if there is another character same as you you cannot under any circumstances be seen with them you also must take a course to match signature style for autographs does it count if it's a different amusement park the one I worked at has one of those sudden drop rides a cow walker found a single screw on the ground and they closed down the ride for days as they went over every inch of the ride turns out it was a screw that could have lead to a seat opening and rider falling out if it hadn't been discovered at Disney parks all the screws on the rides had paint on them and where they are attached as a seal so they can see if the screw is loose or not at least with that they could tell if the screw belonged to the right or not if you hear an announcement over the park wide sound system looking for a specific person it is something very important announcements like that have a chain of approval before this knee will allow the magic illusion to be broken but it's not always bad news like informing families of a death I've done several Park announcements to find someone to inform them an organ donation was matched a medical courier was on their way to Orlando and they needed to get to the hospital as app I worked a cash register in Tomorrowland a guy had a heart attack and died about 10 feet from me I called it in as soon as I saw but they already knew about it I went on break shortly afterward and saw the family literally behind the scenes crying their eyes out that never happens guests are never allowed behind the scenes except when somebody dies I guess really kind of heartbreaking on a positive note they all got lifetime passes I don't work there but had a relevant experience the stories about underground passageways and secret police are 100% true was in the Magic Kingdom for a band trip in high school with a few friends one guy will call him Jack decided it would be a good idea to shoplift some keychains from one of the stores this being just me there were probably 50 different security cameras that saw this a few minutes later we are walking through a crowded area when someone gave me a flat tire and we stalk two big guys are behind us and quietly tell Jack that he needs to go with him and tell the rest of us to let our band director know he needs to get in touch with security they walk over behind one of the stores where there's a cast members only door and disappeared behind it later jack told us they took him underground where he sat in a security room for the rest of the day where he was charged with shoplifting they threw the book at him they don't tolerate that to do community service in Florida we lived in the Northeast in retrospect I have a huge amount of respect and a small amount of terror for how Disney handled the situation they were incredibly subtle with the whole flat tire thing and how they quietly avoided making a scene people walking past us had no idea what was going on I know it sounds silly but that experience alone probably helped me understand how terrifying and effective secret police in places like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany were better than anything we ever learned in class I have an autistic cousin and once and while we were riding the Pirates of the Caribbean ride it broke down my cousin flipped out and Disney security literally appeared out of the walls they took us into the back tunnels and into a freight elevator before we knew it were back outside they were awesome in helping calm him as well the Tinkerbell that ziplines from the castle each night is a nation dude I worked at Club Disney for the brief time it was open we had codes we used on the radio headsets that were coordinated with character names for instance code Balu meant there was blood that needed to be cleaned up immediately one day I'm taking a stroll around the club to check on things when I spot a small boy about two years old taking a massive dump right in the middle of the play area he sees me starts to cry and runs away with no clothing on the lower half of his body I get on the radio and can't think of what to say as we hadn't discussed a code for human fesses in the play area and naked kid running around so I just called I have a code poo situation in the play area and piglets on the news I used to be a cast member at the Disney Store in my local mall we were required to greet everyone within 10 seconds of them entering the store there used to be a game online that kids would play about getting to the back of the store grabbing a stuffed animal from the plush mountain and get back up front before getting greeted I saw this one teenager run across the store and dove headfirst in the mountain of stuffed animals only to quickly find out that they were on risers he was taken away on a stretcher but ended up being fine and yes I greeted him while he was in midair so he lost the game former wdw cast member I swear most of my crazy stories come from working there things I've seen more than once adult drop trouser and take a dump next to a line of people and walk off laughing a mother climb a tree and swing down in the middle of another families meet-and-greet with Beast she didn't want to wait in line three people in wheelchairs in the same tree at another time I have no idea a man tried to swim in Cinderella smoke during fireworks I was guarding the ropes I tackled him Snow White being thrown over the shoulder of a drunk man in Epcot in an attempts to carry her away a Brazilian tour group beat the crap out of Donald Duck nights of joy as hell on earth the park is open to Christian youth groups and has Christian rock bands perform during these nights extra staff is put on an extra security because there is sex and drugs and theft happening around every corner my managers were preparing us for it they said if you see a bush rustle kids are having sex behind it the bathrooms have to be checked every five minutes and any right that goes dark for more that three seconds we'll have Randy teenagers whipping their junk out those nights those terrifying nights on our family trip to Disney World I was leaning over a railing looking down into some water a few unreachable feet below I spot a tiny one five feet to two feet alligator being from Africa and relatively unfazed with a slightly sharp swimming lizard thought nothing of it I called my mother over and said look an alligator how cool sweet Jesus was this a mistake not two seconds later he's everywhere man a staff member was looking over the railing whispering on the radio all hell broke loose in the most hushed professional way ever we were escorted away on a golf cart and a huge section of the park was cordoned off we were taken to a room where they were very apologetic for a negative experience and offered us a free day VIP the works so we said very a big thank you and took what was offered in future I will be smuggling other small harmless creatures in for free stuff I also got stuck on the Big Thunder Mountain ride in Paris that was handled in a much more French way jasoos de soleil blue smoke in face I'm a former Disney World Resort employee I worked as a concierge at a deluxe resort but sometimes had shifts at a value / moderate level resort I came across a lot of famous and crazy people let me know if you have any questions government officials including POTUS normally stay at the contemporary because it is the most secure resort celebrities want to stay in Cinderella's castle but Disney has denied some of them based on how messy they have left hotel rooms before cast members see lots of famous people every day all the time bragging about who you know to try to get free stuff from people getting paid minimum wage won't get you too far on the flip side Disney gives out a lot of money if you complain enough to the right cast member at your resort especially when staying as a deluxe resort there is a good chance you will get money back Disney has a huge budget for this when the Polynesian was under major construction just coming off this now they give out a lot of money to angry guess who didn't do research ahead of time if you are mean to cast members who better believe we are putting notes on your reservation Disney has a lot of computer systems and they track crazy guests behavior when you come up to the desk and scan your magic band I will be warned if you have yelled or been out of line to another cast member and that is across the board all the Disney resorts use the same system as for craziest stories I have been asked to where to get drugs where to go to get prostitutes and I also had a guest that ended up being a con woman I have also had guests pass me their phone number I can only imagine how bad it is for the princesses you definitely learn a lot about people and grow thick skin working fidus me I think that experience helped me get my current job but also allowed me to have newfound respect in what may be the most difficult customer service industry around a friend of mine told me that the rules for workers at the European Disneyland were so so strict that they took to calling it maou sesh wits when management got wind of this they were told that anyone found using that name again would be fired apparently it was only a couple of hours before they were calling it dark or everyone in the call centers is given a stage name so no two agents have the same name to the guests most unique stage names I can remember cotton Caspar Arizona Lucinda when you're in training they give you a selection of like 20 names to choose from so you better hope you're one of the first ones to pick so you can get a normal name and not get stuck with cotton ffs I worked on the great movie ride in Hollywood studies for a while and I can tell you all 22 minutes of your friendly tour guide speech is scripted to the very last letter you get three days to learn your whole monologue and all of the speed / control / stops / those of the actual ride before going live as a tour guide most of those three days is spent in a room with your trainer reciting your script until you get every word right if you accidentally say the word okay instead of all right you start over from the beginning most tedious three days of my life there's also one button on ever car that despite being really close to bottoms you have to touch all the time if pushed gets you fired immediately compulsory I never worked formed as me but a friend did Disney security listens to old Disney radio channels at all times for any distress call or other issue that is relevant to security my friend will call him Daniel because that's his name worked for Disney World in Florida once he worked in one of the resorts I'm not quite sure what his job actually was but his radio call sign was movie runner he was walking between resorts one night and near a pool he was cornered by a mama Bobcat usually not a huge deal because the Bobcat will eventually realize the person is not a threat but he radioed the resort to let them know that he was being cornered by a bobcat next radio transmission without missing a beat movie runner this is Disney security base we understand you are being cornered by a bobcat please remain calm we have two units approaching your location eater two minutes please acknowledge over most likely get buried at this point but I remember once I was leaving the park you know how it gets ridiculously crowded at the exits when the park is shutting down I got elbowed in mows got a bloody nose all of a sudden the star swooped in and took me to the underground tunnels then to a golf cart that brought us to our car definitely a quick exit my first day as a CP college program intern working at the Magic Kingdom in January 2005 after all the tours and fun stuff and exploring the tunnels I had a meal at the mouse Kataria cafeteria and had my eye on Cinderella runs another princess maybe Snow White while I ate they were mad after the meal I went out to wait for the bus back to the parking lot around the same time they left now keep in mind characters aren't allowed to keep their costumes on as soon as they are offstage so the princess is typically walked around in tank tops and short short pajama shorts but the wig wig and film a coupe so I'm waiting for the bus and Cinderella and Snow White slept with one of them boyfriends while chain-smoking turns out they were talking about a girl who played Ariel seriously 21 year old me was in total shock because it was my first day and knew it could only get better from there and it did like the time Aladdin and Peter Pan were making out on one of the tables in the same Mouseketeer ear all the time I saw Mickey Mouse give someone the finger underground directly after a parade it's hot in those costumes she was probably justified all the time a difference in her other got really pissed because Paris Hilton was visiting the park that day and didn't go to see her on the bus Cinderella why wouldn't she come find me oh man good times good times not an employee that I have an interesting story about Disney when I was seven I went to Disney World the third night we were there I rolled out of my bed and cut my forehead on the nightstand my mom came over to comfort me not knowing I was bleeding quite profusely she turned the light on when I wouldn't stop crying she said it looked like a murder had taken place paramedics were called and the room was swarming with what I can only assume would disty employees after I was evaluated and patched up I was taken to the gift shop around 2:00 a.m. with my mom and an employee I got to choose three toys at no cost to my family it was pretty incredible to be in the completely abandoned gift shop and being told I could have anything when we returned back to the room 25 minutes later all the blood was cleaned up guardrails were put on my bed and a large basket of candy and other sweets were left on a table Disney doesn't play around with customer service

0,well today is tax day the day in which you and more than a hundred million other Americans ritually provide the federal government with ten twenty or even thirty percent of your income maybe forty or higher to finance our vast federal bureaucracy and various bombing campaigns around the world most people hate tax day but Carolyne Heldman is a big fan it's hard to find him but we did she's a political science professor at Occidental College out in California and she loves tax day so much she wants to expand it big ly she's called for upping the top tax bracket in America to 80 percent or more professor Heldman joins us tonight professor thanks for coming on thanks Tucker so I just want to get to motive here for a second do you want the tax rate to go up to pay for more stuff or as a way to punish rich people well neither of those things and let's be clear I'm not talking about taxes for your viewers I'm talking about taxes for the top one percent and I'm not even talking about all of their income I'm talking about the marginal tax rate the highest rate which right now is set at four hundred and seventy thousand dollars I'm talking about wealthy individuals who on four hundred and seventy thousand plus would be taxed at a much higher rate than they are now and in fact historically for example under Eisenhower and JFK they were taxed at ninety-one percent now they're taxed at less than forty percent and this has meant that we've scrimped on the social safety net we scrimped on education there are lots of things that this money could go for we spend more than those that almost anyone else in the world but so but it's a quick answer my question I mean it's a it you want to buy more stuff it's not just because you object to the existence of rich people you're not trying to hurt them you just want to pay for more stuff well I don't think rich people are held at the same standards as other taxpayers so I think that there are loopholes and their armies of lawyers and estate planners that allow them to hide their wealth I would like to see that money go into the economy I mean taxes are the price we pay for civilization I would love to see you know free higher education I would love to see our infrastructure crumbling infrastructure system funded in the United States are a lot of things that this money could go for right if you know wealthy people were fairly taxed and they're they just aren't so you're from an affluent family what does your mom think of this my parents my family gives a lot in philanthropy just as I do I'm not on the top 1% but you know we are people who practice what we preach and that means that you give a lot of money away in terms of nonprofits I also use tipping of servers as a mechanism for reading I'm confused okay no but I'm for all those things I'm for free and I'm especially for tipping waiters I agree with you a hundred percent on that and so god bless you buddy okay but you're asking other people to give their money to the government why aren't you giving 70 percent of your income to the government you could well I'm not on the top 1% but I have no issues well that's the argument I'm making right that it's not about working-class Americans or people like me who are upper income Americans it's about really the wealthiest top 1% now sure when you're at college hangtime not a - I'm not on you by the way about 30% I know you're gonna say 7 1 up to 70% I don't understand like what's holding you back you know what I conquer it you know you know what's holding me back if you if I knew how to do that I would have no issue doing that but the catch is instead of the drama so it's totally no no trust me let me simplify it for you just write a check pay your taxes then figure out what you paste 30% you said to figure out what other 40 percent of your income if you just send it to the US Treasury Washington DC knows if code I wonder what I can you tuck her you know what I do instead of that because we don't know your system of Taxation I write checks to nonprofits that are providing services that the government should be providing okay so my write checks to Planned Parenthood I write checks to nonprofits that serve that provide a safety net maybe marrying it or do it have you running like that I think you know but it doesn't actually so why not pass a law requiring people to send money to charity - the more effective for the government welcome you to your base that would be leading that would be great to do as my daughter ones not the most efficient way to don't lift up the poor then why won't he says well you know then Tucker I would say this train wreck of a Trump government is certainly not the best way to serve the poor's if they have no interest in serving the poor but in general I think government does a fine job providing the services what it is asking you to practice what you preach all this let's do another question here I do practice wedding well you know I am going for another night of the government you're not so like I cover the top 1% no no no no no Tucker don't she don't put words in my mouth I am telling the top 1% I'm saying the government needs to tax them fairly if we're going to talk about taxation I actually think I'm taxed pretty fairly I choose to spend way more than the majority of my income on other people I choose to production having got me dressed we're talking about course about talk about you you don't want it awful soccer no you don't get to do this you don't get to lie you don't get no Tucker you don't get to put words in my mouth we're talking there's a note on % professor you're noting you're noting the obvious I'm not on the top 1% it's not an argument about me not you oh yeah yes that is the argument proposing it let me ask you one quick question though I understand it but there's no tax right on the top wealthy there's a real point I think about accumulation of wealth at the top it's probably not good for society I bet we agree on that it's not it's not about income it's not about your income taxes it's about capital gains taxes taxes on investment on capital that is working that's what will get rich nobody's making a billion dollars from salary are you suggesting raising the capital gains tax rate to 70% - I am suggesting raising the capital gains tax on the wealthiest 1% I am - working raising the income tax why you know economists say somewhere around 50 percent would be good income tax you can go as high as 83% and it won't suppress wealth personally why would you want to so I would like with any happen while you're giving it pass to enrich investors I don't understand is why you're checking working people the wealthiest 1% I would like to tax on the higher rates across the board on their salary on their investments and also on what they're passing to the future future generations I want to see the death tax go up I want to see all of it go up because right now the top 1% do not pay their fair share we gotta go but call me when you start sending all your money to the government and then I'll fall oh oh please I'll call you when I'm on the top 1% how's that Tucker perfect we'll have lunch thanks professor
-1,top ten risks and misconceptions about vaccines number ten religious beliefs against vaccinations possible misconception everyone has a right to believe what they believe and if the tenets of their religion prohibit them from potentially life-saving measures then so be it some religions tell that it's against the will of God while others objective AXA nations derived from certain animals one of the earliest incidents of religious objections include a statements from English theologian Reverend Edmonds Massey who claims the disease was sent to earth from God as an indictment against humans sinning number-9 improved sanitation better than vaccinations possible misconception there are still many staunch anti-vaccine advocates that contends that improved sanitation and medical practices have much more to do with decreased outbreaks of disease than vaccinations do while it is hard to debate whether this is the case improved sanitation and medical practices have certainly helped combat outbreaks however it would be hard to conclude that without vaccinations for polio and smallpox would have been nearly eradicated since their introduction that said there are studies that point towards those third-world countries whose population don't have near the issues with allergies the most developed countries do see number three and those non industrial countries certainly not among the most sanitary places in the world number eight MMR vaccines can cause autism possible misconception while there is no actual data the vaccinations cannot cause autism through vaccine overload see number five the medical paper that spurred Jenny McCarthy to spout off against vaccinations has been debunked in 1998 former doctor Andrew Wakefield published a medical paper that claimed that the measles mumps and rubella MMR vaccine could be linked to autism and bowel disease about 6 years later it was shown to be fraudulent through some investigative journalism he was stripped of his ability to practice medicine and it was also revealed that he planned on profiting from the MMR vaccine backlash through a business venture unfortunately the damage was already done and many parents still refused to get vaccinations for their children due to publicity and not being informed number seven thiomersal risks possible misconception theum Ursel or thimerosal and organo mercury was removed from vaccines in 1998 due to the CDC and American Association of Pediatrics precautionary insistence the chemical compounds had been used as a preservative in vaccines against fungus and bacteria since the mid 30s however after a review of food and drugs with mercury the CDC and aap asked for its immediate withdrawal from vaccines this caused issues because some parents took this to be the cause of autism and tried to sue for supposed damages however the CDC and aap were just following the precautionary principle that states that there is no harm in taking caution even if that caution later turns out to be on oriented number six an iminium adjuvants can cause health issues possible misconception immuno logic adjuvant are used to stimulate the immune system in fact Singh's logic would state that this is something that should be done to help their effectiveness but there is a notion that the aluminium contained in these adjuvant could cause the aluminium Associated lesions that can persist up to eight years as well as redness itching and low-grade fever typically vaccines containing these ant events contain less than most baby formula and none of those symptoms have been linked to vaccines number five vaccine overload possible misconception there is a belief among parents that administering multiple vaccinations at once will weaken a child's immune system to the point of being dangerous to the child's health however over the years the immunological load delivered through vaccinations has decreased drastically despite the increase in the number of vaccinations administered and studies have shown that vaccines do not weaken an immune system therefore for vaccinations to possibly overload a child system isn't a valid argument against vaccinations number for prenatal influenza vaccination risks while most doctors recommend that pregnant women get flu vaccines yearly due to the numerous health benefits less than a fifth of all pregnant women get the shot most of that is likely due to women worried about their babies as they should be because there is a theoretical link between schizophrenia and maternal immune response activated by virus antigens is due to evidence that link schizophrenia with flu during the first trimester however most doctors recommend that the vaccination occurs after the first trimester which should take care of those concerns number three increased allergies and asthma there have been studies conducted which have linked allergies to vaccinations the idea is that there's an increased chance of developing allergies and or asthma after being vaccinated like with the pertussis vaccine a New Zealand study found the children who had been vaccinated against pertussis have a higher risk for allergies or asthma meanwhile nut allergies may be on the rise due to nuts being part of vaccines as have milk sensitivities due to vaccine development using bovine casein however the u.s. Institute of Medicine stated in a 2001 safety review committee that methodological weaknesses and inconsistent findings among the studies however led the committee to conclude that there is inadequate evidence to either accept or reject a casual relationship between multiple immunizations and increased risk of allergic diseases particularly asthma number two brain and neurological disorders free radicals typically develop during metabolism of food while others can develop due to toxin exposure irradiation and toxic metals and free radicals destroy just about every part of an organism that they touch as they bounce around your system so it is a concern to some doctors that they can develop because toxic substances are used to create adjuvants see number six which upon entry to the body and brain think it's under attack this causes the brain to release free radicals to combat the toxins causing damage to the brain unfortunately there's nothing for those free radicals to fight and overexposure to that release has been hypothesized to cause them to attack the brain cells causing brain damaging disorders the caveat to this is that most of these issues are raised due to live virus vaccinations and contaminated vaccinations number one infant death a side note in my research for this video I read a lot of articles for and against vaccinations and most of the anti vaccination articles but not all did not disclose whether a family that had adverse side effects also had a family history of those issues to me that would certainly be an issue if the vaccinations side effects are said to cause problems that family history shows to be a problem then it would be prudent on the family's part to take that into consideration when deciding for or against vaccinating their children if you enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe to our channel by clicking the subscribe button in the top right our channel has loads of other awesome videos just like this
0,"reading writing and arithmetic those are the core lessons many of us remember from our school days and while disciplining class wasn't always fun for the vast majority it was never an option but now a surprising number of parents are opting out of that educational norm altogether instead they've decided to cater directly to their child's interests whatever they may be as juju Chang now reports it's a common morning ritual hustling the kids to get ready for school and parents but as the school bus doors close the Martin family isn't on it want to go out and see the baby bunnies did you check on their food today the four martin children ages 11 8 5 and 2 simply don't go to school never have they aren't home school either instead they're what's called unscrews and just picture life without school so maybe a weekend we wake up and we have breakfast and we just start pursuing what we're interested in doing mom Dana Martin doesn't think her kids need to go to school to learn their ABCs doesn't a child need to know who George Washington and FDR and JFK were I don't know do you think they do do you think it's necessary your mom lets you kind of read and study whatever you want what about like math this year before should you do math unschooling is radical enough but radical unschooling extends the lizard fair philosophy to parenting meals for example our up to the kids whatever they want as long as it's in the house and so because we don't punish we don't use the term rules but we have we have a rhythm to our day dad Joe works from home building wooden toy sets in this home there's no bedtime no alarm clocks in the morning so 11 year old Devon often stays up past midnight Devon stays up until 1 o'clock in the morning sometimes and I'm so happy that he does and that he has that time to himself he can have a nice 3-4 hours with Joe or just me what time do you usually wake up around ten oh my goodness well it you know it's the same amount of sleep so while kids everywhere are studying history in the summer of 1765 and geography Bering Strait the Martin kids are free to pursue their own intellectual curiosity Devin's baking projects involve measurements and creativity about 8 to 6 cups of flour I just personally don't believe in that humans learn best when it's when they're trying to learn something that somebody else is telling them to while they aren't always idle there are no tests no homework no lesson plans if you're wondering unschooling is legal because it falls under the guidelines of home schoolers so the regulations vary from state to state dana says her children have learned reading and math without formal instruction but when we asked 11 year old Devon a basic multiplication question he stumbled it permeates our culture that this is about you know working hard getting to the next step sometimes people they'll ask me how do your kids learn if they're having fun all day like they so don't equate learning with fun alright so how do your kids learn if they're just having fun you know whatever they're interested in I try to bring as much of that into their life as possible with as many resources as possible we followed the Martins on a rainy day in Madison New Hampshire to see how this learning through osmosis works they went on a field trip first stop the weather Discovery Center a lot of fun but not always easy for Dana to make her point and says windows cause when air close from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure so what did you learn I loved not to stand on top of the mountain at the rock shop do I do that the store owner quizzes them remember what it does the response how do you see your kids future lives playing out high school college age beyond I don't really necessarily project I just want them to be happy I'm stunned that you've never thought about what kind of jobs your kids would end up well I don't know do you I mean does anybody know do you know can you picture what kind of jobs your kids would have my son wants to be the Yankee third-base so right now it's a little it's a little off perhaps not the best long-term plan Dayna though has become a leader in the growing radical unschooling movement through YouTube videos true learning comes from the internal drive the need from the learner she's even written a book there are an estimated 150,000 unschooled families nationwide Dana who teaches child birthing classes from home part-time even gets paid to go into other people's homes as the UH nanny as opposed to the super strict disciplinarian on the TV show super nanny you will go straight to your room for that behavior right now what kinds of things do you like to do do you Massachusetts mom Erica Berg home schools and is trying to ditch the textbooks and try unschooling most of the struggle is is myself and trying to figure out how to let go of what my idea of school is and the mother of three boys is full of questions what if they really do need algebra and I don't teach them algebras so so the fears that you have are so normal okay and algebra is not something everybody on earth needs to know this is about honoring the fact that we're not all put on the earth to do the same thing in life just connecting and being president now they're so into it it's one thing to follow your child's lead and learning but what about discipline can stay in the backyard and use this hammock while we here okay four-year-old Henry wants to go play on the blue hammock in the front yard at first his mom forbids him but then Dana intervene saying the know could easily be a yes I can't go in the blue hammock we can just as easily move on over here and still have everyone's needs met no I guess so yeah let's do it alright in your mind what was the what was the most interesting tweak that you were able to make one of the things I love to do is sharing how a child feels if a parent isn't necessarily seeing that he has a real real need for going in it and his his needs are just as valid as ours right but the kids say what they need is a whole bag of cookies I don't know three or four we're all set with the cookies okay Dana encourages Erika to try letting her kids have it their way you know when you set up things with limits you're setting up a scenario of kids sneaking things yep I don't know if that's ever happened oh yeah Erika isn't quite sure I just feel like if they ate the whole bag of cookies they're off the wall I think that's something that's gonna take me a while to work on and feel okay about you're doing awesome thank you back at the Martin household Evans baking project passes the test well I could if I wanted to but you don't want to no not really because I like being free and doing whatever I want what about when this learning gets more sophisticated how do you expose them to Shakespeare or Twain or Henry James you know how do you teach them the great works and the great historians if you can't get them to sit down and and learn well I think a lot of people might value that more than others I honestly don't remember yes although I know their names I don't remember the details of what I learned in school about the historians for example details her children may never have the chance to forget for nightline this is juju Chang in Madison New Hampshire"
0,"At some point, you’ve probably heard someone
 call their emotional ex-boyfriend a psycho. Or maybe they said that their tidy roommate
 had OCD, or their unpredictable neighbor was totally schizo, or their moody sister was
 bipolar. We do this a lot...and let’s stop. Think about it this way...if your friend doesn’t
 like sugar, you aren’t like “Ugh, he’s such a diabetic.” Just imagine saying “Oh! My ex was a TOTAL cancer patient. He was sick ALL THE TIME!” Ughh! Many mental health professionals point out
 that using diagnostic terms as misplaced metaphors for odd behavior, personality traits, or even
 changes in the stock market ultimately minimizes serious conditions, and the people who have
 them. So we’re here today to help clear up some
 of these definitions, and explain why the weather isn’t schizophrenic, and how your
 ex probably isn't actually a psychopath. First off, it’s important to understand
 what ""psychological disorder"" really means to the experts. Psychologists define a disorder as a deviant,
 distressful, and dysfunctional pattern of thoughts, feelings, or behavior that interferes
 with a person’s ability to function in a healthy way. Now, let’s break that down: Deviant doesn’t
 mean something like dastardly or raunchy -- it just means something that’s different from
 your general social norm. And that can be pretty broad; like, serial
 killers are deviant from the norm, but so are geniuses and Olympians. So, to be classified as a disorder, those
 deviant thoughts or behavior need to cause the person, or people around them, actual
 distress, which pretty much means a feeling that something is... off. And that distress can turn into a harmful
 dysfunction if it limits a person’s ability to live and work. Take anxiety, for example. It’s something that we all have to some
 degree -- getting the jitters before a first date or a big speech in front of a crowd - totally
 normal. But being so distressed at the thought of
 interacting with others that you actually can't leave your house … then that’s a
 disorder. So, your roommate does not have obsessive
 compulsive disorder, or OCD, just because she can’t bear to have dirty dishes in the
 sink. But she very well might if her compulsions
 are interfering with her ability to live a healthy and happy life. OCD isn’t about being neat, or particular,
 or just deciding that you really like the color orange and want to wear it a lot. It’s a serious, often debilitating condition
 characterized by unwanted repetitive thoughts, which can be known as obsessions, and when
 they’re accompanied by actions, those are called compulsions. For people with OCD, compulsive behavior can
 be a way to try to relieve the intense anxiety that comes with obsessive thoughts -- like
 a fear that, say, if you don’t walk over and touch that light switch exactly four times,
 something terrible is going to happen. Kind of puts the dirty dishes in perspective. And bee tee dubs, if you don’t wanna wash
 your dishes and your roommate is mad at you, that is not their problem, because CLEAN YOUR
 DANG DISHES, JEREMY, AND WOULD IT KILL YOU TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH ONCE A YEAR! Another term I’m sure you’ve heard -- and
 heard used incorrectly -- is “schizophrenic.” Really not a suitable way to describe your
 moody neighbor, just because he called the cops last week when your music was too loud,
 but then came back a few days later with leftover birthday cake. That is not being schizophrenic -- that’s
 just a person being nice to you one day, and not nice another. True schizophrenia is pretty rare -- affecting
 only about one percent of the global population -- and it’s probably the most stigmatized
 and misunderstood psychological disorder of them all. And that might be why the term is so often
 misused. We see the term “schizophrenia” used in
 the media all the time, to describe political flip-flopping and fluctuations in the stock
 market, even eccentric celebrity style choices. One study of the terms “schizophrenic”
 and “schizophrenia” in US media found that 28 percent of references to the condition
 were casual metaphors...usually about someone or something seeming to have multiple personalities. And guess what….schizophrenia has nothing
 to do AT ALL with having multiple personalities. This myth may have its origin in the fact
 that schizophrenia literally means “split mind”, because the condition is marked by
 thoughts and behavior that are out of sync with a person’s actual surroundings and
 situations. Their mind is split with REALITY...not with
 itself. People suffering from schizophrenia often
 suffer from delusions, either of grandeur, like thinking you’re the Queen of England,
 or of extreme paranoia and persecution -- like thinking the CIA and the mafia - or both - are
 out to get you. People who have schizophrenia are also likely
 to suffer from hallucinations -- that is, to see or hear something that isn’t there,
 while lacking the ability to reliably judge what is and isn’t real. So, “schizophrenic” is not a synonym for
 “inconsistent.” It’s a devastating disease and one of the
 leading causes of disability in the world. Now, speaking of mood swings -- as well as
 things we shouldn’t use to describe superficial things, let's talk about bipolar. You may recognize it by its older name -- ""manic
 depression."" But like depression, bipolar is a type of
 mood disorder. Our moods are basically long-term emotional
 states that are pretty subjective and hard to pin down, but they usually fall within
 two broad categories with very fancy technical names -- good and bad. Mood disorders are marked by emotional extremes
 and problems in regulating moods. So, the symptoms of depressive disorders include
 prolonged feelings of hopelessness and lethargy, while bipolar disorders are typified by alternating
 among depressive, manic, and what you might call more normal or stable phases -- often
 between phases multiple times a month, week, or even a single day. And keep in mind that mania isn’t about
 being super happy, or energetic. A true manic episode is an intense period
 of restless and often overly optimistic hyperactivity, during which your estimation of yourself and
 your ideas and your abilities can often get really skewed. A person experiencing a manic episode might
 start feeling awesome, but quickly start to show some seriously poor judgement as they
 empty their bank accounts on shopping sprees. When they come down off that sleepless high,
 they often fall, hard, into sometimes suicidal lows. Which brings us to our final, and perhaps
 most popular psych term, mis-used since the days of Alfred Hitchcock: Psycho. Psychopathy is another outdated term -- it’s
 more often called sociopathy these days, but professionals know the condition more technically
 as antisocial personality disorder. It’s probably the most extreme and severe
 type of personality disorder, which are some of the most difficult disorders to diagnose
 and, frankly, to live with. That’s mainly because, unlike most disorders,
 people with personality disorders often aren’t aware of their condition. Sometimes, they think it’s everyone else
 who’s got the problem. People with antisocial personality disorder
 exhibit a lack of conscience, even towards friends and family members. Their destructive behavior surfaces in childhood
 or adolescence, beginning with excessive lying, fighting, stealing, violence, or manipulation. They basically don’t care about any negative
 consequences of their actions, and because they lack the capacity for empathy, they don’t
 give a dang about you, or anyone else. So even though we really love Benedict Cumberbatch,
 his Sherlock Holmes was flat-out wrong when he described himself as a sociopath. I mean, just look at how he and Watson get
 along. It's adorable! Now, just what causes antisocial disorder
 or any of the other disorders I’ve mentioned is complicated, and honestly we have a long
 way to go in understanding it. Some conditions seem to be pretty clearly
 linked to biological factors such as genetics and brain chemistry, while others seem to
 stem from specific situations, or environmental factors, like stress or trauma. And some cases appear to have roots in both
 causes: People could have a genetic predisposition to a condition that tends to run in families,
 like schizophrenia, but may only have symptoms if they’re triggered by their surroundings. If you want to learn more about these disorders
 and other scientific aspects of your mind, you can head over to Crash Course, where we’ve
 been studying psychology all year. But in the end, we’re not here to tell you
 how to talk -- or, for that matter, what to be offended by -- we’re just all about understanding
 the world around us, including people. And it’s probably fair to say that using
 clinical diagnoses to describe haircuts or dishwashing habits only fuels the misunderstanding
 of mental illness. A final note...in general, when talking about
 people with medical disorders, try not to let the disorder define them. Instead of saying that someone is a schizophrenic,
 say that they have schizophrenia. It's hard enough to try not to become your
 disease when your disease is inside your brain; it's even worse when it's inside everyone
 else's too. So next time someone is annoying or alarming
 you with their behavior, allow me to suggest a thesaurus. Thanks for watching this SciShow Infusion

 Reviewer: Mile Živković I'd like to tell you a story. It's about a little boy who grew up in Sweden, 
 in the '60s and '70s. His dad was this tall,
 good-looking army officer. His mom was this pretty but shy linguist. He had a brother and two sisters,
 and they lived in suburb of Stockholm. And that little boy was me. I think I remember
 the first time my dad hit me. I was around three or four, I think. I was walking in front of the TV
 and he kicked me, and I flew into some bookshelves. And I remember there was blood
 and my mom was screaming. You see, my dad had a lot of problems
 and he took it out on me and my mom. He never touched my brothers or sisters. And this started
 when I was about three or four and went on till I was about 11 or 12. It was a really hard part of my life because I had to go to school
 with a black eye or, you know, some of my hair was missing
 because he'd been yanking my head. I think some of you may know
 what I'm talking about. I understand how you're feeling. You see, when you get abused at home, you have two choices, 
 just like and animal: fight or flight. You can either run away, which was impossible for me
 because I was a little kid living at home; or you can fight back, which I couldn't do because,
 you know, I was just a little kid. My dad was my size. But I learned later 
 there's a third choice: you freeze. It's like a gazelle being taken by a lion. You just freeze and go dead;
 all your emotions are bottled up inside. When he was hitting me,
 I wouldn't even cry. And, by the time I was 11 or 12,
 I was smoking, I was drinking, I was running away from home
 on stolen motorcycles, sleeping over in someone's garage, but my dad always found me. Back home for another beating. So, my grades at school were terrible, and my dad said, 
 ""I've got to do something. I've got get rid of this kid somehow
 and get him out of here."" So, he decided to send me up north,
 to his parents', my grandparents'. And they lived in a small town
 in the northern part of Sweden. Now, Sweden is a country pretty far north. I mean, Stockholm in the winter
 gets dark at 2:30 p.m.. Stockholm was like Miami Beach,
 compared to the place I was being sent. But my grandparents were quite nice to me, and they took care of me
 and my grades got better. I discovered ice hockey,
 and then weight training, and karate, and I started to heal. And, by the time I was about 17 or 18,
 I remembered something my dad had told me. Because, you know,
 my dad was this pretty smart guy, he was very charming, he was a nice guy - most of the time,
 when he wasn't going nuts. And he told me, ""Listen - Listen, kid, this socialistic country,
 forget it, you can't do anything here. If you want to be somebody,
 you've got to go to America."" I always remembered that. So, I kind of got all the scholarships
 I could because I didn't have any money. I got a scholarship to WSU,
 Washington State University; another one to Clemson. Finally, I got a
 Fulbright sholarship to MIT, which is the reason I am standing here. And there was just one little snag - because, my forth year
 to my last year as a master's, I was in Sydney,
 at the University of Sydney, and I was studying engineering
 on a scholarship, and I was working extra as a bouncer because, you know,
 that trauma is really helpful when you get into a ring with somebody. So, I became a pretty good fighter. I was a karate champion and I had
 what you call a ""killer instinct."" So, me and my buddy
 who was my sparring partner got hired to do some special work
 at a rock concert, different artists, and one of them was
 this beautiful black singer, a statuesque lady named Grace Jones. We worked there and, afterwards, she hired some of us to do
 especial security at her party when she was going to go out
 and hang out at the nightclubs in Sydney. I didn't really realize right away why
 she'd picked this tall, blond, buff guy to be her special security. But, you know, I found out
 later that evening. (Laughter) I, uh - (Laughter) I ended up in a hotel room, missed a few classes
 the next day, college - And, you know, 
 she was a world-class artist, totally out of my league. That's what I thought,
 but she didn't agree, you know. So, we ended up having this relationship. I went to Tokyo to do some karate,
 she was there doing a commercial. Then I ended up moving to New York. So, I had a couple of months
 before I was going to start at MIT, and those months literally changed my life
 because my what happened was - This was New York city, Studio 54 - I met David Bowie, Michael Jackson. First week I was there,
 I went to some party. There was a little guy with white hair. He came up to me and said,
 ""Hi! What are you famous for?"" He took a picture of me and I'm like,
 ""Nothing, as far as I know."" And he goes, ""Hey, I want
 to put you on my magazine."" Well, that was Andy Worhol,
 Interview Magazine. So, finally, when it was time to go back
 to school, to Cambridge, MIT, chemical engineering just didn't seem
 as exciting, somehow. (Laughter) So - But, anyway, I picked this big black
 motorcycle I had bought, 1200CC, threw Grace on the back,
 all decked out in leather. I got in my leather pants, I didn't wear a shirt
 too often in those days. I drove up to Cambridge, and I think the professors at MIT
 had a slightly different idea of who this Swedish star student was - (Laughter) So, when this thing just - ""vroom"" -
 went past a window, I think they were
 sort of shocked, you know. They expected somebody else,
 slightly smaller, maybe with some Coke-bottle
 glasses or something, but, anyway, they were as shocked
 as I was not belonging there. I felt that right away,
 and three weeks later I was gone. I went back to New York, got an agent - so all other actors - started studying, acting,
 got up for a couple of movies. One was a ""boxing"" movie. It turned out to be Rocky IV,
 and I auditioned for it. Finally, I got the role, moved out here. I was training with Sly Stallone
 down here, about a mile away from here. And the film was shot and opened
 30 years ago, Memorial Day. And I came out of the theater with Grace
 and people were taking pictures of me, and I'm like, ""What happened?
 Oh, I guess I'm a movie star. OK, great."" But, you know, the problem was this:
 my troubles had only started, because what happened
 was that frozen part of me - remember that I told you? - started coming out
 and kind of running my life. Because what happens is this:
 when you have this trauma, it's like a soldier
 with post-traumatic stress. You end up acting on something
 called escape behavior. You try to escape from something
 you can't escape from because it's inside of you: drinking, sexual affairs,
 overeating, violence, you name it. I did a lot of bad things to myself, and, 25 years later, 40 movies later, yeah, I was a movie star,
 but I was miserable most of the time. I had a failed marriage, two daughters who I loved,
 but they didn't even know me. My career was kind of rock-bottom. This was only five years ago, and I didn't know how to get out of it. Two things happened. I got a call from
 my old buddy Sly Stallone, ""Hey, Dolph, how are you doing?"" (Laughter) ""I've got this script, so check it out,
 see what you think."" Well, the script was called
 The Expendables. It was a big hit, I was back
 in the big screen after 15 years. The other thing is I met this girl,
 fell in love with her, and I knew I was going to embark
 on the same stupid path I'd been down before. Actually, something happened. Some girl was flirting with me,
 I gave her my number - The usual: the text,
 the pictures; she saw it - A few of you may have been there. She went nuts, we were about to break up, and I said, ""I can't do this.
 I've got to change my life somehow."" She'd told me before,
 ""Why don't you try therapy?"" I was like, ""Forget about it.
 It's for sissies."" ""What about meditation?"" ""Ah, do I look like an Indian guru?
 I don't think so."" (Laughter) So, to make a long story short, I took up therapy
 three years ago, meditation, and it totally changed my life. Suddenly, this fog
 that I was living in lifted. I did the therapy
 where you go back in time, you relive your experiences, you cry,
 scream, you roll up in a little ball, you hit the couch
 with a baseball bat, you know, anything you've got to do
 to start to attack this part of you, this frozen part of me
 that was running my life. And slowly it started to become
 smaller and smaller, and I could sort of see my life
 come back to me. And the meditation helped as well. So, the first thing I did: I went back to see my kids, and I asked them for forgiveness
 for what I had done because I told them
 what happened with my dad, and I was a guy who
 didn't like what I'd done, and they started crying right away. And I realized they had had a lot of pain,
 and I cried with them. I did the same with my ex-wife, and a few other people I had hurt. And, as a matter of fact,
 I also, in my head, forgave my dad for what he did, and my mom, for what she didn't do. And I started embarking on this new life. It was like a fight worth fighting,
 to come to terms with yourself, to heal yourself. But what I didn't realize
 was there's another level to that, because, once you start
 healing yourself and feel better, you see other people around you
 who need help, who have pain. And faith kind of came to me, and I wrote and produce a movie
 about human trafficking, called Skin Trade. And I learned about human trafficking,
 which is a terrible crime. There are 20 million slaves
 in the world today. It's a 20-billion-dollar industry,
 second largest in the world. These people are physically humiliated,
 psychologically abused. They have no self worth,
 sort of like how I used to feel. And kind of faith brought me
 in contact with this, with human trafficking and these victims. When I came back to LA,
 I called an organization called CAST, and asked them if I could help - Coalition to Abolish
 Slavery and Trafficking. Well, I've been helping them ever since, and it's a great feeling for me
 to finally give something back. You know, a lot of this human trafficking isn't just happening in, like, India,
 and Africa, and over there. As a matter of fact,
 one of the most interesting cases was a girl that was brought over
 from a Third World country by a very wealthy family. She was kept in a house,
 they took her passport, kept on the guard all the time,
 threatened her with violence, threatened her family. You know where the house was? In Brentwood, right here, about a mile from here. And she didn't know what to do. They brought this American nanny in
 to take care of the little kid, and they talked, and the American
 nanny said she'd help her, but nothing happened,
 a week passed, a month passed - Finally, they were coming back
 from the park one day. She was taking care of this kid,
 and there was this security guy as usual, and there were 15 FBI agents
 outside of the house. They took her inside and said, ""Do you want to stay
 or do you want to leave?"" She said, ""I want to leave."" CAST got her into a shelter,
 re-educated her, brought her back. She learned a job. She finally ended up 
 getting a green card. As a matter of fact, she met this man from her home country,
 that she fell in love with, and they got married. And to be part of something
 like that is just amazing. As a matter of fact, Alice is also
 pregnant with her new baby, and towards the end of my talk,
 I wanted to say hi to Alice. Please stand up. (Applause) Anyway, I guess, for me, the experience
 that I told you about is - like, you have to come
 to terms with yourself. You have to love yourself so you can
 appreciate those things in others. If you heal yourself, you can heal others. And - I think if you take time
 to look inside and find that little boy, that little girl, inside yourself - then, you treat them well - and are you ready to look and see a little boy or a little girl next
 to you that may need some help? Because, if you do that, it's just the greatest feeling in the world. Thanks. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)"

 Reviewer: Denise RQ I read a recent survey, and the title was,
 ""Survey on American Fears,"" and what Americans fear most
 is public speaking and dying. In other words, my TEDx talk. (Laughter) If that weren't tough enough,
 tonight's topic is illumination, and the question is really:
 can dying be illuminating? What we know of dying is based on
 what we have observed as witnesses. We have all seen grim,
 physiological decline and suffering, and we've all felt profound loss. So, if there is light
 within the darkness of dying, it's in the experience
 not in the observing. So tonight, I'm going to share with you the words and experience
 of dying patients. And my hope is that you hear
 what I have heard: the dying often describing
 their end of life in ways that are actually life-affirming, and rich with meaning,
 love, and even grace. Before I go any further, I need
 to give a few disclaimers. If it looks like I cannot stand still
 and I'm pacing, it's because it's true. (Laughter) The second is that, aside from my mother, nobody has ever described me as particularly spiritual
 or for that matter, enlightened. And trust me, this talk has nothing
 to do with the paranormal. A much harder truth for me
 is that I have a deep aversion to the non-physical,
 spiritual aspects of dying that goes back to my childhood. On August 6, 1974, I was 12 years old, and I was standing over the bed
 of my dying father, who was 42. As he lay in there, he reached out and started
 playing with my buttons on my shirt, and he said we had to hurry;
 we had to catch a plane. We were going to go up north
 and fish like we had before. And that was the last time I saw him. My point here is
 I didn't choose this topic of dying; I feel it has chosen or followed me
 throughout my life, personally and professionally. Like my father, I became a doctor. This may sound strange,
 but if you have an aversion to dying, medical schools are
 a pretty safe place to be. They never mention dying,
 let alone the experiencing of it. Medical training is learning
 how to defy death, and when you can't defy it,
 you deny it, in whole or in part. This approach to medicine worked for me when I was doing things
 like working in emergency rooms. But in 1999, through a series
 of unusual events, I ended up at this place called hospice. At hospice, the curative science has not only failed the patient
 but has abandoned the doctor who is, eventually,
 compelled to be present. And when I was present
 at the bedside of the dying, I was confronted by what I had seen and tried so hard
 to forget from my childhood. I saw dying patients
 reaching and calling out to mothers, and to fathers,
 and to children, many of whom hadn't been seen
 for many years. But what was remarkable was
 that so many of them looked at peace. In April of 1999, I was in the room of a patient
 I was particularly fond of. Her name was Mary. She was nearing the end of her life,
 and her four children were also present. One day, Mary starts cradling
 a baby that nobody can see. She refers to him as Danny
 - a reference nobody understands. The next day, Mary's sister
 arrives from out of town, and explains that Danny was, actually,
 Mary's first child, who was stillborn. The loss was so deep that Mary was unable
 to speak of it during her life. Yet, while dying,
 this indescribable loss returns to her in some manner of tangible warmth
 and tangible love. Mary, like so many dying patients, had physical wounds
 that could not be cured, A few weeks later, I went and saw
 a young man named Tom. I came out to the nurse's station,
 and I said, ""I think Tom has more time if we just give him some IV antibiotics
 and some IV fluids."" Without so much as looking up, a nurse named Nancy
 says, ""Nope, he's dying."" I say, ""Why?"" She says, ""Because he's seeing
 his deceased mother."" I say, ""I don't remember
 that class from medical school!"" She says, ""Son,
 you missed a lot of classes!"" Anyways... (Laughter) Tom ends up dying. What Nancy knew that I did not know was that Tom's end-of-life
 experiences had meaning. They were significant,
 and not just to him, but to those of us
 entrusted with his care. So, if I were to have any worth, I needed to understand, I needed to learn. I learned that end-of-life experiences are
 the subjective experiences of the dying and often refer to
 pre-death dreams and visions. Such experiences have been reported
 throughout history and across cultures. They are mentioned in the Bible,
 Plato's ""Republic"", Shakespeare. In our culture, the richest
 and most thoughtful discussions have always come from the humanities
 and never medicine but from poets, playwrights,
 and philosophers. These observers have commented that end-of-life experiences
 are so frequent they are essentially intrinsic
 to the process of dying. They're characterized
 as real, intense, meaningful; provide comfort, insight, and in so doing,
 help alleviate the fear of dying. So why does medicine has so little to say about something that's so meaningful,
 and actually, potentially therapeutic, not just for the patient
 but for the patient's loved ones? In part, it's because end-of-life experiences
 can easily be dismissed as confusion. And it's true; many dying patients experience confusion
 as they go through the process. However, in contrast to patients' experience
 with end-of-life dreams and visions, confused patients are detached. They have disorganized thinking. They're unable to figure out
 their surroundings, and they are more often than not
 terribly agitated and anxious. The patient you are about to see
 in this video - her name is Jeanne - was nearing the end of her life;
 and she has since passed. (Video starts) Jeanne: I was lying in bed, and people were walking,
 very slowly, by me. The right hand side, I didn't know,
 but they were all very friendly, and they touched my arm
 or my hand when they went by. But the other side, were people that I knew. My mom and dad were there, my uncle; Everybody I knew
 that was dead was there. And they passed and did the same thing. I thought it was a good dream, but boy, I remember seeing
 every piece of their face. I mean, I know that was my mom and dad,
 and uncle, and my brother-in-law. I have seen my mother, recently, more. Interviewer: How do you feel
 when you see her? Jeanne: Oh...! Wonderful! I can't say that my mother and I
 got along all those years, but we made up for it, at the end. (Video ends) Christopher Kerr: Jeanne isn't confused, and it would be dehumanizing her
 to label her as such. But she shows us so much more. She shows us that dying is this paradox: she is physically declining, yet, emotionally and spiritually, she's vivid; she's alive,
 and she's present. End-of-life experiences are not only
 tied to our personal meanings but they are tied
 to some of our greatest needs: the need to love, to be loved,
 nurtured, forgiven. End-of-life experiences
 also represent a rich inter-connectivity between body and soul, between the realities we know,
 and those we don't, between our past and our present. But most importantly, end-of-life experiences
 represent continuity between and across lives,
 both living and dead, so that mothers like Mary
 can hold their long-deceased children, and children like Jeanne can be reunited and comforted
 by their long-deceased mothers. So, again, the question: why are the words of the dying
 not worthier of our consideration? I don't have all of the answer, but it's true we live in a time
 where seeing is believing, and where data and evidence are requisites
 for both understanding and acceptance. Unfortunately, when it comes
 to end-of-life experiences, most of the reports were based
 on anecdotal reporting. In other words, nobody
 had asked patients directly or attempted to quantify or measure. So that's what we've done, and to date, we have
 over 1,400 interviews with dying patients. In our first study, we spoke with 66 patients
 every day, until their death, and gathered 450 interviews. What we found was
 a vast majority, over 80%, reported at least
 one pre-death dream and vision, described as more real than real,
 and distinct from normal dreaming. The next question is:
 what were they dreaming of? We found out that 72%
 dreamed of the deceased: family, relatives, or pets, 29% of the living, and 28%
 of past meaningful experiences. So the next question was this: did different dream content provide
 different levels of comfort? Here's comfort on a zero to five scale,
 with five being the highest. And of all the dream types, seeing the deceased was associated
 with the greatest degree of comfort. The next question was: were there changes over time in either the content or frequency
 of dreaming as patients approached death? Essentially, the Nancy question; could you almost predict death
 based on changes of these variables? Of course, again, Nancy's right. Frequency is on the y-axis,
 weeks before death are on the x-axis. As patients approach death, they've a dramatic increase
 in the frequency of their dreaming. They are dreaming,
 specifically, of the deceased, which is associated with
 the greatest comfort. So, the next question we wanted
 to ask in our next study was what did these mean to the dreamer? Were there common themes?
 Were there common meanings? The most common theme
 was that of a comforting presence. Seeing the dead or seeing the living
 was overwhelmingly positive provided a sense of reunion,
 and the feeling that one was not alone. Maggie, for example, was in her 80s. She had been harmed greatly
 by a childhood friend, later in life. And before she dies, she dreams of this friend,
 who comes back to her and says, ""Sorry, you are a good person.
 If you need help, just call my name."" Kenny was 88 years old. He lost his mother as a child. And before he dies,
 he dreams he's a child again. He is in his mother's kitchen,
 and he says, ""I smell her perfume,"" and hears her soothing
 voice say, ""I love you!"" Sandy was raised by her sister Emily. And before she passes, Emily returns
 to her in a dream and says, ""Remember what I taught you."" Many patients reported
 seeing the presence of others, and they're described
 as simply being there, watching. Little is said, but much is understood. This next video is Paul. Paul has a terminal illness. In fact, he dies three weeks
 after this video. But he's talking about his deceased wife. (Video starts) Paul: I dream in color, most times. And she always wears
 a beautiful light blue. It could be a suit.
 It could be a gown. It could be a dress. But it's always light blue. A couple of times, she's giving me
 the little beauty pageant wave. And a couple of times, she, sort of,
 greets... always with a smile. Only once or twice
 have I ever heard her voice. She always lets me know that she's fine. I get that feeling
 after a dream like that. (Video ends) CK: As I said, 60% dreamed
 of this theme of travel. Jimmy sees many deceased
 friends and relatives and says, ""I haven't seen
 some of these people in years. I know we are going somewhere,
 but I don't know where."" Others dreamed of the deceased
 just there, waiting for them. Sarah says, ""There were six dead
 family members in my room waiting for me. It's good to see them."" Less frequently, people
 had distressing dreams. These are often relived, past,
 traumatic events, such as war. And here again is Paul. (Video starts) Paul: Another thing I've dreamed of
 quite often, not lately, is I'm back in the service. I'm at Fort Devens up in Massachusetts, where they were forming this company
 we were going to oversee; a new company. The guys are all young. They're like...
 I remember them! And I am old. And I'm trying to tell them, ""Guys! I've been here. I've done this.
 I'm not going to do it again!"" And they're arguing with me! (Video ends) (Laughter) CK: I have the deep privilege
 of hearing many people's life stories which tend to emerge
 or come to surface at the end of life. Sometimes, I'm saddened by the amount
 of trauma and tragedy people have endured. But more often, I'm inspired by the strength of the human spirit, and its endless quest to heal
 what is harmed, and what is broken. And this brings me to the story of Mack. I met Mack in 2011. When I walked into his room and started
 to talk to ask him what was wrong, he gave me three words, and he said,
 ""A war problem."" His family explained that Mack never spoke
 about the war, but in the last few weeks, he was unable to close his eyes
 without reliving the horror. He couldn't sleep that's why
 he was coming into our facility. Mac went on to explain
 that he was a World War II vet. He was very proud to be from Texas
 and serve on the USS Texas. At the age of 17, he was involved in
 the invasion of Normandy, in June, 1944. He was a gunner on a landing craft
 that went from the ship to the shore. But his nightmares were about
 the return from the shore to the ship. Because that's when he was
 transporting the dead and the dying. He called these nightmares
 terrifying and realistic. He says, ""There is nothing but death...
 dead soldiers all around me."" A few days later, Mack was completely transformed. He looked comfortable
 and at peace. He could sleep. He said the horrifying dream had quieted,
 and in its place were two types of dreams. There were comforting dreams
 and neutral dreams. In the comforting dreams,
 he gets to relive the day he got his discharge papers
 from the military. In the neutral dream, a dead soldier
 comes up to him on a beach. He doesn't know who he is, and he says, ""Soon, they, your fellow soldiers,
 are going to come and get you."" Mack was rescued by the dead soldiers
 he had tried so hard to save. He had closure. He could close
 his eyes. He could rest. He died peacefully,
 and he died with his dignity. But just think about it. The human spirit and that courageous
 17-year-old boy fought for 67 years to be free, to be released from that enormous obligation,
 from that pain, from that horrible injustice. His end-of-life experiences didn't deny
 his reality, didn't deny him his war, but it recast it in such a way that he was finally granted
 his hard-earned peace. I want to end where I began: my hope was that you'd hear
 what I have heard from the dying. Their words are compelling and relevant. And I hope they leave open the possibility that there is light
 within the darkness of dying. Look back on your own life. Think of your greatest loss, your greatest comfort,
 and your greatest wonder - loss of someone you loved, the familiar, warm hug of a grandparent,
 the birth of a child. What if, at the end of your life,
 at some appointed hour, the lost return, distant feelings become familiar,
 and meaning is restored? If any of that is true,
 then dying is illuminating. Thank you. (Applause)"
-1,all right Tom Heinberg we're here today we're gonna watch this video pro vaccine versus anti vaccine should your kids get vaccinated the answer is yes we understand video tells the spoiler alert welcome to Jumanji my name is David Epstein and I'm a pediatric intensive care physician and Bob Sears I'm a pediatrician I guess my greatest passion is just to help encourage full complete and foreign consent informed consent just so you know is code for we think vaccines cause autism he has he has the voice that they all have wasn't even though he's a man well voice is that is feeling I trade I'm a designer by trade I'm a small batch hand sewn sauerkraut artist also vaccines cause cancer Melissa Lloyd and my trade I'm a full time Googler this conversation can be open for people and continue to inform people and to listen to everyone to understand why we each come to our opinion on this this is something that idiots and charlatans both use which is like the open-minded argument yeah you're not open-minded enough right and it's like hey Z how come you're not open-minded to rape as a mating strategy you know historically it was a very successful mating strategy for males in our species you know there's a great-great-great-great grandfather probably raped how come you won't rape women are you just not open-minded enough I guess there are two sides to the rape debate Tom that why don't we just put a line in the middle and the pro rape I just want you to hear me out about my views on rape um I'm also a full-time rapist which means I rap professionally and hate vaccines what my trade I am a Rhino gynecologist aka Ryan ecologist ever since I was young I was into rhino vaginas I don't know what it is I was vaccinated as a child but my last vaccine was about 15 years ago when I returned to college and I had a severe reaction and that I became arthritic in my hands went to many many doctors and nobody know what was going on and why I was happy and then just shrug like it doesn't make sense you're too young to have arthritis and it wasn't until having kids and sort of digging into my own research for them that a lot of cancer started coming up and I think it's unfortunate that a lot of it is overlooked the correlation between having a disease and being vaccinated is something that that anti-vaxxers confuse all the time with causation and again this is the again this is all like data the emotional truth of it is she's just simply wrong and it's sad and now she's harming her children because of a misconception that she has trying to explain something that maybe wasn't super easy to explain now this is the debate Jeong they're not getting vaccinated I can't wrap my head around the fact I'm a pediatrician I went to medical school and did residency and I can't understand not vaccinating in dangers other people how could that be I'm Bob Sears and I endorsed this message of pure abject stupidity anti-vaxxer rissalah look at this okay Marisa wait hold on wait a second as a full time dolphin trainer to me it seems that it follows from first principles that this makes no sense to me I will acknowledge of course as a pediatrician I know vaccines work I know they give you protection that they they vary greatly and what that protection is it's not like a hundred percent magical shield over you completely but I do acknowledge there are some vaccines like the measles vaccine and the chickenpox vaccine but honestly if you don't get those vaccines yeah you do risk catching the disease and passing it to others I don't I can't understand what's Bob Sears old deal because he did say that he knows that vaccines are effective Bob Sears is one of the most dangerous people around and I'll tell you why he got in trouble his license is not in probation in California for giving inappropriate vaccine medical vaccine exemptions to children's he's never even examined so tell me that's not unethical tell me this guy's not a criminal tell me he isn't a danger to public health tell me he's not a delusional threat and he sits here like a comp sci commute art to believe him when he says but other vaccines don't you shouldn't get them that guy man he's actually and I'll tell you I've talked to pediatricians in California who are like that guy see dog could you stand up and say that because I can't say it because I get dinged his unprofessional I don't give a bob Sears and all his book right he's also a beta kook I mean I heard him talk I mean that's another guy burn I think yeah if you get Mike Rowe probably some of these vaccines I think when you're giving kids medication you have to get Mike Rowe about it I don't think it's doing your kids any service to just say vaccines are all made the same and they're all safe and healthy think good for you that ever but he's benefitting from it because that's false we study them before we release them to the public we study them so we do know they're safe unless it's something very narcissistic at the heart of the anti-vaccine to Lee this is a deep narcissism it's saying I know more than years of study and years of research and yeah there's an empowerment in that and an individualism but the truth is it's a delusion and also for her it's like I can't have arthritis I'm special right special people don't get her why would I be defective I was injured by a corporation exactly it's much easier to process them you just have bad luck you know or bad genes another thing is I respect parents who are on the fence about this they should be asking questions the the problem is he's a professional she said a man activist yeah his professional anti-vaxxers I think it no quarter from me they are deluded and they are hurting children you know being an intensivist I see the worst of the worst and so seeing the other side of kids who don't get vaccinated I saw a kid walking with meningococcemia which I haven't seen in decades he had all four limbs cut off they had to be amputated because it was all dead tissue you forget how bad things were before we had vaccines that is the way you communicate about vaccines which is remind us of things we don't see anymore the emotional resonance of a child who had to have limbs amputated because of meningococcemia which is preventable with a vaccine and he didn't get vaccinated because of a decision a parent made because they're listening to anti vex my Rissa who is a designer and a mother but has no training in immunology or science unvaccinated children don't just have diseases hanging out in their bodies waiting to unload at any moment anybody could be spreading diseases especially things like polio and pertussis that are not completely covered by the vaccine Wow look she just doesn't understand the basis of science in this Bob Sears is siding with people like this yeah what she just said is crazy deigned it's crazy irresponsible and let me just quickly say why and he's giving her you know he's giving her fodder she's basically saying you can spread polio pertussis being vaccinated this is true you know why because of the unvaccinated population that creates a reservoir and an opportunity for infection even partial immunity to those things in a large community where you have 95% vaccine penetrance and in in that kind of community immunity situation you're much less likely to spread the disease and this has been shown so she's absolutely wrong but she says it with a calm confidence and a demeanor that will convince mothers dangerous it wasn't until she had a reaction and several reactions that I actually had to look at it differently where I I realized by continuing vaccinating for her that actually would hurt her and yet everyone wants me to do it for the population as if I'm supposed to continue to sacrifice my child for everyone else well I mean well so well let's think about that let's say your kid really did have a vaccine reaction the one or two in a million right that's like saying you know you got in a car accident and the seat belt killed your child that's fine you don't want to put seatbelts on your other kids that makes no sense you want to go publicly and be an activist against seatbelts and say you know what we got to stop wearing seatbelts that is freaking insane crazy it's crazy it's crazy also all tricks that have bangs are crazy that's a fact you know what that's a fact you know what guys who have bangs are even crazier because they feel they are just not willing to risk the side effects for the side effects or the side effects are like one in a million one or two million whereas this side Tom hi never you need that understand I am a hip hop a Potamus by trade and you're just wrong on these statistics don't EULA don't you love how the minute that the minute that he says that they are no no yeah yeah yeah because they're reading in these crap like natural news blogs or how would I not help yeah you know people email me this stuff all the time and I'm like I'm not gonna respond to an article from green med news hey have you seen the high wire with del face because he makes a lot of compelling point anyone who has to name himself a big tree because he has a small penis it's just and I only started investigating vaccines because I ended up with a kid with an autoimmune disorder so what does that mean and instead of finding answers I have more questions and the one in a million is not a real number listen to me really carefully she said she was diagnosed with arthritis she has a kid with an autoimmune disorder could it be perhaps that there's a genetic basis to her autoimmune disorder HLA b27 or something similar and now our kid has it and there's your explanation are you implying that we are genetically inferior to you you sickly bald ugly disgusting gross sickly look like you're on chemo you don't know me you don't know my body okay you know you know listen I know just know this'll be good maybe like there's not enough money you know we're like imma coming to you like a spider monkey but I have people who won't be friends with me who I've had death threats on social media I might not even be able to send my kids to school depending on how legislation changes be and you shouldn't be yeah no you should shouldn't be able to so let's just clarify that you have to understand if you're making the stance you pay some degree of societal consequence for the you know the death threats are inexcusable but I I share other people's frustration with her I mean it's so frustrating to know that these people are putting their child at increased risk and this is why all of our children this is why it's so polarizing and then the way they see the probe oxide is well these people just don't understand these horrible risks and our kids are getting mutilated by these needles and you know I think yes conversation is going to be important but then these debates are tricky because it isn't really two sides to the science I trust my physicians my daughter has epilepsy and in March she was also diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis I went to the rheumatologist and the rheumatologist said we're gonna put her on methotrexate and I looked at her I'm like methotrexate that's a chemotherapy that the Kimber therapeutic agent that you know kids with cancer get and she's like yes but we use it in a low dose and it doesn't cause harmful side effects you have to trust me I said okay and I trusted her and I am so glad that I did before all this happened she was a competitive gymnast and she used to walk up and down the stairs like she was 90 years old she couldn't hold a pencil in her hand now she's back on the bars back on the on the beam doing things which my wife and I never thought that she would do again so yes do I trust my physicians yes do I question them yes I will say look can we do this for her can we do this instead and yes you know I I can appreciate what you guys have said as far as people hearing you and I think that's the biggest problem in medicine is that time is short clinicians aren't listening and I think that as as a pediatrician you know one of the most important jobs that we have is to listen to parents and I think that if any pediatrician isn't doing that they're not doing their job the reason there's hostility at least you know on my platform is we think this is a life-and-death issue for children we care we went we spent a career studying this stuff and caring about people and and to see it all flushed away based on what we see is really just bad science now what's not bad and I think I got out of this debate is the emotional resonance with the anti-vaxxer they really feel like they've been harmed they really feel like this is the reason for their suffering and they really feel like telling the world about it okay I understand that like I see you as a human being yes but we're gonna have to do better to figure out how to counter this now the question is is it shaming and ridicule because she feels ostracized already I think we need to dial that up to 30 I think in society there should be no quarter for running into a theater and yelling fire which is what these guys are doing the professional activists but should we be able to sit and talk about walki your child had a bad reaction here's one and had the bad reaction let's talk about it and and why I would still vaccinate my child but I also witness and appreciate the suffering that your family went through that's something doctors are unwilling to do to a large extent because we are pretty dogmatic we are pretty conditioned and we're worried it's going to set a bad example I don't think so it's kind of like apologizing if you make a medical mistake your chances of being sued are much less because you're a human being and you're doing what you know is right yeah so listen I just had a two-month-old and we fully vison her on schedule on time and she was fussy she cried the entire day and then guess what happened nothing nothing she's fine yep and now she's protected and same with my kids and I just don't know why people wouldn't want that for their own child yeah so there you have it a real doctor and Tom watch pro vaccine versus anti vaccine should your kids get weight oh no she's back here's the thing who said where's that Tom guy who said chicks at banks I'm a camera also my country like a spider monkey del big tree by trade I'm a certified Reiki proctologist my trade I ran a porn site that specializes in camel toes by trade I'm a personal shopper by trade I sell other people's things on eBay for them by trade I'm in a pyramid scheme by trade aim the pyramid in the pyramid scheme by trade I paint the eyelashes on sex dolls
1,"this is one of the toughest talks when you're talking about vaccines you are messing with religion and one of the things that so frustrating is the difference between what actual science says what information you're getting from their standard doctor and how the completely insane procedure is being forced on us I mean I came from the 60s we're forced medical procedures would not have flown well okay force medical procedures without informed consent is what we're dealing with but if it saves us all would everyone be ok if I forced you to take a vitamin now you can't have employment unless you take vitamin C you can't have employment unlit or your kids no education unless your children get vitamin do you have a challenge with that yeah I mean even though the vitamins are completely non-toxic so let's look at this we're going to go through the ignorance for one this is what the people in power are saying vaccines are safe and effective we'll look into that mercury has been removed from the vaccines and I love this the most ignorant guy I mean if it was legal to hunt okay well he's head of infectious disease at a hospital and he says well the mercury in vaccines is less dangerous than mercury in a fish sandwich we're going to actually go over the studies on that the term I saw in vaccines has been used as a preservative is safe your unvaccinated child is going to put my unvaccinated child in danger and vaccines don't cause autism it's interesting to know that there's over 80 studies that show it does so let's go into it well first we have the healthiest population of kids in the world or the sickest the sickest literally I mean you're talking 1 & 2 of a chronic illness or disease if we transferred the this data to water buffalos and I said we have this herd of water buffaloes where 1 & 2 of their offspring have a chronic illness or disease would we go in and maybe check the environmental cost or we would just say its genetic just better diagnosed no 1 in 45 autism rates now the toughest if we if we compare us to the rest of the world infant mortality we used to be 12 when I was a kid we're now 77th and it's where our kids are getting exponentially ill autism unless you're buried in the sand because there's some people it's just better diagnosed and that's not true okay because otherwise we'd see a bunch of 67 year-old autistic people particularly at a 1 in 45 however we only have about 8 more years to where it's 1 & 2 now autism is is a huge problem with the brain but it's also a huge problem with employment since 94 percent can't hold down a job so if we had 1 in 45 adults with autism we would see that a parent in our economy now if you haven't seen the movie VAX I recommend it this was a study done back in 2002 or 2004 and what they did is they decided to close the door on science you know just say hey look we're going to do a study and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the measles mumps and rubella vaccine does not cause autism now they didn't test them all they just tested a small group okay and they didn't do a placebo controlled trial the problem is the numbers didn't really add up so if you go in to do it in a study and your goal is to prove that vaccines don't cause autism but it actually shows about a three hundred forty percent increase in autism you know you say no let's crunch the numbers let's hide it okay so William Thompson actually one of the senior scientists did he was involved in the study and he says look I got to come forward we need whistleblower status we lied okay now this should have been on every news station everywhere and it wasn't now if you're pro science and if you think science is accurate do we have any data that this schedule is safe for every human being if we took a hundred children and gave each hundred of them the same drug would we have the same effect in 100 kids no of course not it'd be impossible what if we did 69 doses of 16 different vaccines in everybody does it make sense that this might have some negative effect on the body but now also what are the animal studies who chooses this well let's see how we got into this for one how do they decide that a vaccine is actually effective it's interesting because you can't you know shoot a bunch of people with a flu vaccine and you know dump a bucket of influenza over them and see which ones get sick right so what they use is a thing called antibodies and this is an old theory it's not true but it's an old theory of the Journal of neurology and this is the role of antibodies control on viral diseases from experiments now it's interesting demonstrating that antibodies play literal or no role in controlling viral infections well they are crucial in resolving bacterial infections such as acquired dogmatic status over the years and is commonly found in immunologic textbook and other scientific publications so this means every time they're measuring an antibody for viral infections it's not accurate let's take it a little further did you know back in 1968 and start do Studies on patients with a gamma globulin emia and these are patients that couldn't make antibodies so the theory is that if you have a load of antibodies towards the disease that you're protected and if you don't have a lot of antibodies you're more vulnerable problem is they took this group of kids who had a genetic defect they couldn't make antibodies and here's the wrench in the works they contracted measles in the normal fashion show the usual sequence of symptoms and signs and were subsequently immune even though no measles antibodies were detected in their serum so maybe the immune system is a little bit more complex have we gone into this no because there's no other way to test to see if a vaccine is actually working this is what I deal with okay we get a vaccine damage kid one to at least a week from everywhere around the planet and we're talking alterative colitis Crohn's disease not full-blown autism and this is what a destroyed gut looks like now when continually I'll get people say well vaccines don't cause autism okay and then I got this these two girls okay they come from Arizona and they were both totally nonverbal autistics luckily they're starting to talk but they went through a nine-year court battle to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt in court that the DPP shot caused their autism so when you hear people in authority they're safe and effective and they don't cause autism that's wrong that's wrong so they knew this back in the 80s in fact so many people were getting damaged by vaccines they had to do a protection thing now now you know granted you got two choices okay you know we're all you know beings with with hopefully common sense we have a product that's damaging so many people that the company is making the product are going bankrupt from the lawsuits you can do a couple of things one a make the product safer or B give the company's liability or immunity from lawsuits so even though the product is dangerous and hurting people you can't sue the manufacturers and then you know let's really get in bed with the manufacturers let's not even build them for the cases of this let's add a tax per shot that's what they did so the national childhood vaccine Act even though kids were getting damaged they passed this act to it completely eliminate any product liability so this means that that they could just just produce whatever they want add whatever they want and you cannot sue the doctor you cannot sue the company okay this is beyond amazing beyond amazing that that this would have passed now what they did they put a check and balance in there okay now remember this is back in 1986 when we still had exemptions now they put in the vaccine adverse event reporting system bears and what what and this is how the system is going to work because they obviously thought that well if we give them liability free and unlimited access to a market they might get out of hand okay so you had you had to and this is back then he provided a written and vaccine benefit and risk information before the vaccination takes place that's when I was first done in 1986 I know what you're thinking where in California risk and benefit before it takes place why would they do that when it's forced we don't even have informed consent anymore in California you understand that if you're in the military no informed consent if you work at a hospital no informed consent so that's been taken away I know I know that's been around since the Nuremberg trials I had just flush it okay they're supposed to keep a permanent record of all vaccines manufacturers name a lot number record serious health problems and put into the patient's permanent record and make a report to the federal vaccine adverse event reporting system bombing injuries death here's the problem between one and ten percent of all of the injuries are reported can anyone read that backwards between ninety and ninety nine percent are not reported are not reported now you might think this is just a money-grabbing pile of crap but let's look at it back in 1986 23 doses of seven vaccine a course back in 1986 we also had exemptions so people could opt out for them opt into it take half change the schedule do whatever you want okay of course 1997 33 doses of 9-valent was added now 19 2016 69 doses of 16 vaccines why the increase was there's a big cry from the public save us save us our kids are sick no and so now we're looking at this our kids are suffering there is an environmental cause so is there evidence and right now you can you can tell that there's so many people looking at their computers on YouTube they're human but they protected us from disease they're safe there's just a genetic susceptible population it's not in the literature let's look at the literature okay the cost of the vaccines went from $80 per child to 3,000 okay and we're looking at I mean if you don't have any kids this is what parents are paying or your health insurance and drug companies won't be liable for any injuries deaths under the new in the new law so now this is what the vaccine companies are paying out okay now now remember let's go back because I know it was two slides ago and it's hard to have that long of a memory but no one gets that time okay I'm going to start you on Bible humor okay so when you look at this remember ninety to ninety nine percent of all the adverse events are not reported so you could multiply this by factors okay we're talking a hundred and fourteen million dollars was paid out okay in vaccine court settlements a thousand percent increase for the flu shot three hundred percent increase for hepatitis B 75 percent for the DPT shot I mean when you look at this and millions of dollars is paid out and this is in one year don't worry I know what you're thinking my god if the vaccine company has had to pork this out they might go out of business no it's our tax dollars so it's okay this is an attorney and I'm just looking in there trying to find what a pro vaccine person would do because I'm not anti vaccine I mean if he's stupid this is stupid this one law firm they've collected over 200 million dollars in the past three years for their clients and I doubt if they're the only firm now you understand that we have anti-discrimination laws in this country okay this is not North Korea well kind of in some respects okay so you could have full-blown HIV infection and you can go to school you can have chlamydia tuberculosis go to school you could have full-blown hepatitis B virus you could be an IV sexually active drug using prostitute and go to school and be okay but if you don't have a vaccine you're discriminated against okay anyone find that like a little weird okay so there's no laws to protect your freedom of choice there's no informed consent now if they're safe and effective like remember I was going to force everyone in here to take an ass vitamin okay you know and you're in you're not going with that so let's look at the safety studies okay what does Webster's dictionary say free free from Parmer risk safe now the problem is you're going to see multiple vaccine safety studies because if you have an idea what's what a safety study should be we should have a placebo right and a placebo is supposed to be an innocuous substance given so this means you know you take one a therapy group of Lucido group and oh I don't know maybe a control group you don't do anything to them and then follow them for a bit let's look at it human experimental toxicology journal safety studies have not been conducted to determine the safety or Vica see if it's even good for administering multiple vaccine doses in a variety of combinations recommended by the CDC guideline and this is not just an American psychosis a buddy and patient from Dubai sent me this record for his kids they're going through the same stuff it's not the same volume that we have but it's the same psychosis I I mean there's no safety studies that show and just just like how would you do a safety study with 69 doses of 16 different vaccines over 18 years how would you do that okay now this was the last part of the study and this is going to be a shocker it turned out that if you give more vaccines to a younger smaller baby that you have more negative responses than if you give less vaccines to an older bigger baby I know yeah it's it's like really you had to do a study come on okay so let's look let's look at the mercury okay because because remember you know the the vaccine experts and this is one of the reasons I put this on there is because it's vaccine experts are saying no heat the mercury in the shots because mercury has been taken out of the shots and so even though mercury is neurotoxic he can't be one of the causes of the autism epidemic have you heard that raise your hand if you've heard that okay good let's cut through that crap okay according to the facts sheet form is all acknowledges acknowledges this is the the sheet from Eli Lilly thermistor Raza in utero in children can cause mild to severe mental retardation and mild the severe gross motor impairment that's on the package insert most seasonal flu shots have 25 micrograms of Tamayo for this the kid needs to be 500 pounds 550 pounds now you might say well how do they get away with that you want to know how they did it not one-shot what they do is they average that 25 micrograms over a year and they say see it's safe okay they're my salt is a neurotoxin that's so toxic if you put it on your skin and be illegal however the CDC recommends that pregnant women and newborn children get influenza vaccines that seems odd now they go back okay now in 1999 granted that was a long time ago we're talking like 18 years but the and this is the delusion that mercury is all removed from the vaccines the amount of mercury in the childhood vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC exceeded all national and global maximum safety limits so the American Academy of Pediatrics the United States Public Health Service called for immediate removal of thir - off from all vaccines sounds good right they get behind something that makes sense and so by 2003 the vaccine manufacturers had begun to react okay good it only took them four years however in April the CDC recommended that pregnant women and young children get the flu vaccine now even though it was never tested on pregnant animals well that doesn't make any sense if you read the package insert okay now this caused widespread confusion no kidding because mercury had been removed from most of the childhood vaccines except for the flu shots now the problem is the added since they're adding flu shots and they also added a couple of more shots since 1999 the amount of mercury added to the immunization schedule outweighed the amount of mercury taken out so we're looking at tetanus shot flu shots so the FDA and the CDC have increased the possible maximum childhood exposure to mercury from vaccines to twice the level twice the level that was triggered in 1999 Kait now federal statements regarding through my saw okay after a three-year investigation congressional report by the staff Subcommittee on human rights and Wellness Committee on government reform mercury and medicine let's just read this okay because if the doctor recommends a flu shot to you okay or a flu shot to your daughter or granddaughter or pregnant wife there - all used as a preservative and vaccines is likely related to the autism epidemic this Emma demek in all probability may have been prevented or curtailed had the FDA not been asleep at the switch regarding the lack of safety data regarding injected through - all in the sharp rise in infant exposure to this known neurotoxin in our public health agencies failure to act is indicative of institutional malfeasance and self-protection and misplaced protectionism of the pharmaceutical industry Wow why isn't this on channel 4 channel 7 why aren't people just in up in arms I mean this is mind-boggling we go in and these are all the people that that form the statement but FDA criminal negligence is in not instituting the class one recall of all vaccines administered to infants containing - - all in July 1999 and again the 2,000 we have determined that you're above allegation that from us all is being used in order to increase the manufacturers profit margins represents a potential conflict of interest issue which may be criminal in nature this was 16 years ago okay this has never been followed up why because the pharmaceutical industry is has tons of money now again if you're based in science if you think your scientific base and you think that that the vaccines are based in science and the doctors make in scientific recommendations and the doctor is actually reviewing this have any animal studies did well you there have been two of them although this one was printed and then pulled because it indicated that vaccines were not good so they took a rural human University of Pittsburgh took a group of small monkeys okay rhesus monkeys and they inject our macaque monkeys and they injected them with the scaled-down version because they're smaller than humans and the same schedule so 12 hours BAM hepatitis B okay first month mayhem you get the DPT you know all the the whole schedule I think up through the first year and what they found significant differences in the GI tissue gastrointestinal tissue gene expression profiles between the vaccinated unvaccinated animals wow so they actually vaccinated one group and didn't vaccinate another group what this study doesn't show okay and this is amazing because one of my patients is the pediatrician and he'd bought the vaccines form they said they couldn't eat regular monkey chow they lost all social behavior activity biologic changes and altered behaviors did occur in the back side monkey groups which resembled autism spectrum disorder no such symptoms were present in the unvaccinated group then they dissected the brains that they found damaged now here's another one okay and this is where a head of infectious disease at a hospital this guy I know there's a special place in hell for I know it even if you don't believe in the concept this they did is they gave monkeys a shot and check the blood levels for mercury they fed them a tuna sandwich or a mercury filled sandwich and check the blood levels they were amazed that the blood levels of the thermos all exposed monkeys went down so there was no blood blood mercury levels founded around seven days verse twenty four days for the ones that ate the mercury so what can you say if you don't read any more of this study you can say wow that's amazing so it looks like the vaccine is safer however the large difference in blood mercury half-life compared to the brain half-life 2 the through - all exposed monkeys indicates that blood mercury may not be a good indicator for risk of adverse events on the brain particularly under the conditions of rapidly changing blood levels as those observed after the vaccinations now data from the present study supported the prediction that although little accumulation of mercury occurs in the blood over time with repeated vaccinations accumulation of mercury in the brain of instance will occur I'm sorry repeated vaccinations accumulation of mercury in the brain will occur brain is not a good place for mercury okay it's neurotoxic it's not good for you thus the conclusion regarding the safety after - all drawn from the blood mercury clearance data in human infants receiving the vaccine may not be valid given the significantly slower half-life of blood mercury in the brain I've observed I mean kid and I actually heard them mention the study and he only mentioned the first part that said hey it's it's it shows that it clears out of the blood quicker is that purposely ignorant or purposely evil I don't know man if you're if you're an expert in humans you should really want to take care of them okay then you look at it more Institute of Medicine recent publications direct length of the Maya Fokin taining vaccines and it's the significant rise in children being nice diagnosed with autism institute the medicine reviews safety studies found that there's not sufficient evidence to render an opinion on the relationship of ethyl mercury exposure and development disorders and children so you look at this in yes there's a link no there isn't yes there's a link no there isn't isn't there enough to like study it okay then you look this approach is difficult to understand okay I love this a recently published second review appears to abandon the earlier recommendation as well as back away from the American Academy of Pediatrics school this approach is difficult to understand given our current limited knowledge of the toxic oh kinetics and the developmental neuro city of jeremiah saw a compound that has been and will be continued to be injected in millions of newborns millions a newborn they say it's toxic we know studies that it knows it's toxic we know it's been doubled in the schedule but we're not going to study it I mean look at the Journal of Neuroscience vaccines alter fetal brain development increase in Caesar susceptibility promote autism spectrum disorders these are not ho bunk journals let's look at the National Institute of Health pubmed anyone want to go there you know for the idiots that say oh vaccines aren't associated with autism how about we look at an article that's titled a positive association found between autism prevalence and childhood vaccination uptake across the u.s. population would that be a value to get a headline well it takes a lot to motivate you but I would think it would be enough okay a positive and statistically significant relationship was found the higher the portion of children receiving recommended vaccines the higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder neither parental behavior nor access to care affected the results since vaccination proportions were not significantly related to any other disability or number of pediatricians in matted States the results suggest that all the mercury has been removed from many of the vaccines other culprits may link vaccines to autism other culprits may like vaccines to autism other culprits may link vaccines to autism can anyone read okay any pediatrician can read I mean shouldn't this be a value there should be criminal lightened liability for this for the study into the relationships between vaccines and autism is warranted no kiddin now when you look at the Journal of toxicology increased rates of autism if you look at the Journal of Public Health autistic disorders prevalent directly there related to vaccines then then you look at this study they're comparing the DPT shot or pertussis and rubella vaccines it's interesting they're just comparing these two not to six doses of the deep peaty okay they're just comparing these two and what they found was that yes there is a causal causal relationships a big deal it means it actually caused it okay now it'll cause anaphylaxis acute encephalitis which is swelling of the brain hypotonic which can't move anything hyper responsiveness and periods of inconsolable crying and screaming I don't know shot anyone okay now if you get the rubella vaccine of course it can cause acute and chronic arthritis and women now this is interesting they found insufficient evidence to say it's causal or not presence or absence of a causal relationship so there's not enough data in this study to say yeah for sure it caused it except for this stuff or it maybe it did we just don't know and they're looking at chronic Darrell Jeff meningitis rash beyond bere which is paralysis diabetes learning disabilities peripheral neuropathies I mean that you shouldn't that that that should like maybe make us check into it here's another analysis of the DPT and chronic nervous system dysfunction and nil analysis why do they need a new analysis because they know that the DBT causes neurologic damage this is one of the ones that was wiping out the vaccine companies so they said yes it can cause neurologic damage in three possible scenarios okay the committee posted three possible scenarios where acute neurologic illness that will follow the DPT might be related to chronic nervous system dysfunction now then they go through the say look we're not supporting it you know one scenario over another it's just there there okay this is what's happening because we're seeing a lot of a big rise in neurologic problems one scenario DPT administration might cause a serious acute neurologic illness and subsequent chronic nervous system dysfunction in children who might otherwise not have experienced either an acute neurologic illness or chronic nervous dysfunction in the absence of DPT that means perfectly healthy kid we inject we got damage okay like the two kids from Arizona now here's another scenario DPT might trigger an immediate proximate cause but nibble is still a cause of an acute neurologic illness in subsequent chronic nervous system dysfunction in children with an underlying brain disorder or metabolic abnormality so if you have something see if I inject you you would never have gotten the problem but because your body is defective okay you got the illness honest-to-goodness okay that's why we're here in metabolic defective things here's the third scenario so one perfectly healthy kid gets a neurologic damage from the neurotoxins in the DPT second one you had a defective body you could have responded well but you didn't you got a neurologic illness third one the DBT might cause an acute neurologic illness and children with underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities that would themselves eventually led to a chronic nervous system dysfunction even in the absence of an acute neurologic illness so you're already messed up this just made it apparent okay now time and time again if you know anything about epidemiologic studies case studies how different studies are made you know for a fact that epidemiologic studies which is what all the ignorant science-based pro-vaccine people use these epidemiologic studies the problem is epidemiologic studies are not designed to find the cause they're designed to to break out and perform new studies so you can be more specific this is a good book of the National Institute of Health review the MMR vaccine and autism executive summary and I like this now this is the findings findings from unpublished studies which were shared with committees publicly and through personal communications which are in the process of being sublet mitad for publication seem to provide additional evidence of no association between measles mumps rubella and autism spectrum disorder although the findings still need to be peer-reviewed published and subject to scrutiny by broader scientific community okay so now if you're ignorant we can stop there anyone want to be educated let's read paragraph two I know the doctors that do this stuff they don't read paragraph two although these epidemiologic studies do not support an association of the population level is important to recognize that the inherent methodological limitations of such studies in establishing a causality the highlighted portion of the bottom furthermore the rarity of individual autism spectrum disorders and the difficulty in determining their exact onset and therefore the temporal relationship between onset and vaccination make certain epidemiologic study designs impractical impractical so you might say well why didn't we do a vaccinated with unvaccinated wouldn't you I would think that'd be cool okay here's that because because they go through and they starts thinking well you know this is some of the problems and this is what they're recommending see doing the epidemiologic study that came to a conclusion that there wasn't a problem there saying let the studies not even designed it assess causality so this is what they want this actually makes sense so there are some really good scientists out there who are being mean just Lam basted and destroyed in its discussion of recommendations related specifically to the measles mumps and rubella in the autism spectrum question the committee identified more general concerns that it could not adequately appropriately address when this report these include deficiencies in the available information on the risks and benefits of vaccines inadequate discussion on the ethics of providing information regarding the risk and benefits of vaccines the role of public input into vaccine advisory committees and inadequate clinical provider information on vaccine safety or the vaccine adverse event reporting system do you know who recommends the vaccines do you know how went from 23 to 33 to 69 these is called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices these are 97 percent of the people on these panels work the vaccine industry they're not doing any studies summary and you look at this the the immunization safety review committee concludes that the evidence favors a rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR and autism spectrum however this conclusion doesn't exclude that the possibility that the MMR could contribute to the autism spectrum disorder and a small number of children because the epidemiologic evidence lacks the precision to assess rare occurrences of the response from the MMR vaccine alena autism and the proposed biologic models linking MMR to the autism spectrum disorder although far from establish are never less not disproved okay so in English it means the study wasn't designed to shape a show causality we don't know if it does or not we should do some further studies okay this is it does that kind of make sense here's the problem do bullets kill people occasionally but not all the time this smoking caused lung cancer not all the time why because 60% of people to get lung cancer never smoked okay I've shot a gun a bunch of times haven't hit one person yet I'm really thinking about this you know I said I see that that little you know look there it is yeah yet let's look at some of the studies okay the rotor shield 1999 now diarrhea is devastating particularly in developing nations why would anyone have diarrhea toxic food toxic water may be a good response to the body yeah here's the challenge if you are dehydrated you can have heart attacks and you can die so you're talking about two kids a year die from diarrhea okay but now do you go in there and say hey man we got to fix the infrastructure we got to get wells to clean the water get the food no we're going to develop a vaccine that can stop this rotavirus okay now here's the tough part the more subsequent infections that you get from this virus you actually develop a better immunity okay where does doesn't end a bind of bothering you so now the rotor shield was the first vaccine it was put on the market killed a bunch of kids and took off the market so they had to still do it so the next one the rotor tech went in and if you look at it you think wow seventy one thousand infants three placebo-controlled trials serious adverse events were very similar in the placebo group okay anyone want to see what the placebo group and the rota tech group took the rota tech group took the rota Tech the DPA T the IP V the hepatitis B on the hip and the PCV vaccine that was the treatment group what did the placebo group take the beep beep beep pap IPV the hip the hepatitis B and the PVC vaccines problem no no man you're thinking there's no control group huh I mean I was I was talking to some patients today and a couple of them I mean we're talking like engineers doctors and stuff "
-1,"In 1796, the scientist Edward Jenner injected material from a cowpox virus
 into an eight-year-old boy with a hunch that this would provide
 the protection needed to save people from deadly outbreaks
 of the related smallpox virus. It was a success. The eight-year-old was inoculated
 against the disease and this became the first ever vaccine. But why did it work? To understand how vaccines function, we need to know how the immune system
 defends us against contagious diseases in the first place. When foreign microbes invade us, the immune system triggers
 a series of responses in an attempt to identify
 and remove them from our bodies. The signs that this immune
 response is working are the coughing, sneezing,
 inflammation and fever we experience, which work to trap, deter and rid the body
 of threatening things, like bacteria. These innate immune responses
 also trigger our second line of defense, called adaptive immunity. Special cells called B cells and T cells
 are recruited to fight microbes, and also record information about them, creating a memory of what
 the invaders look like, and how best to fight them. This know-how becomes handy if the same pathogen
 invades the body again. But despite this smart response,
 there's still a risk involved. The body takes time to learn
 how to respond to pathogens and to build up these defenses. And even then, if a body is too weak or young
 to fight back when it's invaded, it might face very serious risk
 if the pathogen is particularly severe. But what if we could prepare
 the body's immune response, readying it before someone even got ill? This is where vaccines come in. Using the same principles
 that the body uses to defend itself, scientists use vaccines to trigger
 the body's adaptive immune system, without exposing humans
 to the full strength disease. This has resulted in many vaccines,
 which each work uniquely, separated into many different types. First, we have live attenuated vaccines. These are made of the pathogen itself
 but a much weaker and tamer version. Next, we have inactive vaccines,
 in which the pathogens have been killed. The weakening and inactivation
 in both types of vaccine ensures that pathogens don't develop
 into the full blown disease. But just like a disease,
 they trigger an immune response, teaching the body to recognize an attack by making a profile
 of pathogens in preparation. The downside is that live attenuated
 vaccines can be difficult to make, and because they're live
 and quite powerful, people with weaker immune systems
 can't have them, while inactive vaccines
 don't create long-lasting immunity. Another type, the subunit vaccine, is only made from one part
 of the pathogen, called an antigen, the ingredient that actually triggers
 the immune response. By even further isolating
 specific components of antigens, like proteins or polysaccharides, these vaccines can prompt
 specific responses. Scientists are now building
 a whole new range of vaccines called DNA vaccines. For this variety, they isolate the very
 genes that make the specific antigens the body needs to trigger its immune
 response to specific pathogens. When injected into the human body, those genes instruct cells
 in the body to make the antigens. This causes a stronger immune response, and prepares the body
 for any future threats, and because the vaccine only includes
 specific genetic material, it doesn't contain any other ingredients
 from the rest of the pathogen that could develop into the disease
 and harm the patient. If these vaccines become a success, we might be able to build
 more effective treatments for invasive pathogens in years to come. Just like Edward Jenner's
 amazing discovery spurred on modern medicine
 all those decades ago, continuing the development of vaccines might even allow us
 to treat diseases like HIV, malaria, or Ebola, one day."
1,"Hi, my name is Brittney Kara and I am a wife
 and a mother. I'm married to a fireman, his name is Kellen,
 he's a fire fighter paramedic, and we have three children, Kayla is 8, Kelsey is 4, and
 little Beau, our son is 5 months old. I'm an author and speaker, entrepreneur, I
 run a home-based business through a company called Isagenix and we specialize in nutrition
 and cleansing, detoxification. I've been a natural health advocate for many,
 many years since I was probably about 16 years old. It is my goal and my joy and my purpose to
 educate others about how to be healthy and to provide that lifestyle for my family and
 my children everyday. Kayla, my oldest, she's my rock, she takes
 care of everything for me. If I need help with the other little ones,
 she helps me. She does amazing in school. She's in a high gifted ability program in
 a local school here and she does very, very well in her academics. She's an artist. She loves to draw. She's a dancer. She just got accepted into our local dance
 company. She's going to be competing in dance now,
 which she's very excited about. Then Kelsey is my middle one, she's my little
 spitfire, she's got just a lot of energy and a lot of creativity and a little bit of stubbornness,
 but she gets that from me, so I like that fire in her. She loves to draw. She loves fashion and shoes and taking care
 of her little brother, and just being a little four year old. Then Beau is our youngest, he's our son and
 he's kind of a miracle baby for me, because we weren't going to try to have another one
 and then we decided we wanted to. My husband really wanted a boy so badly and
 we just prayed about it and we got him naturally, no sorts of intervention in that area. We just prayed and God gave us a son. He's wonderful. He's a good sleeper and he's so bright and
 smiley and beautiful. It was interesting for me because I raised
 two girls and then to have a boy, I wasn't sure how that was going to be and I'm just
 madly, madly in love with him. He's so much fun. I do a lot of things to keep my family healthy. It's my number one goal and drive every single
 day, is to reduce my children's toxic exposure. All my friends tease me and I've always been
 that natural, geeky, organic, healthy mom, but I think it's really important. We look at everything that comes in to our
 home, whether it's what we clean the floors with and the detergents we use to wash their
 clothes, we look at the ingredients of that, to what goes into their body. We do all organic, non-GMO products in our
 home. We cleanse regularly. We do a lot of whole foods. We do supplements. We do oils. We do homeopathic medicines. If they're ever sick we use homeopathy. We go outside. We go outside. We're at the beach a lot. My kids get a lot of sun and the other thing
 that I do, is I really try to teach my kids about why they should or shouldn't eat certain
 foods. They've never been to a drive through. They've never eaten fast food. They don't even really know what McDonald's
 is. Then the last thing that we do that's really
 important to me to keep our kids healthy is we do not vaccinate. I stopped vaccinating because I started to
 do some really in-depth research at the vaccine industry, and to be honest, I really didn't
 even ever want to start vaccinating because I was such a natural organic health advocate
 already. At the time my focus was primarily in research
 of GMOs and food labeling laws and what was happening in that. When I got pregnant it was just a natural
 progression for me to look at what was also in vaccines, because I looked at ingredients
 in every other facet of our life, why would I not choose to look at the ingredients that
 are being injected into my baby? With our oldest, I was really apprehensive. I knew I didn't want the Hepatitis B vaccine,
 I thought that was just ridiculous. I wasn't really sure, and at the time my husband
 was still very much pro-vaccine, so it was an argument for a couple of years, to be honest. He's exposed to really sick people at work
 and he's been trained in the medical field. He's a very, very bright person, so we would
 just kind of go back and forth and what we decided was with our oldest we were going
 to do a delayed schedule. We were going to try to not do any vaccines
 until the first year of life and we were just going to do the DTaP to start. Then we got pressure by our pediatrician to
 start a little earlier and so we did, and we started Kayla on her first rounds of Dtap
 and she had instant reactions. I mean, I'm a mom so when people say, ""Parents
 don't know better than their doctor,"" that's such a lie because we're with our children
 24/7. We know every freckle, every speck on their
 body, we know how they breathe at night, we know what they ... everything. We look at everything because we're obsessed
 with them, it's our baby that we created. I saw an immediate change in her immune system
 and she got her first and only ear infection, followed by her first and only round of antibiotics. That was enough for me to stop and I told
 my husband, ""We're stopping. I don't want to do anymore."" At that point, you guys, I was really still
 scared. I was scared of disease. I wasn't sure if we were going to keep vaccinating
 or not, but I just knew I needed to learn more. I really dug in deep and I started to research
 and research and research. Then my second daughter was born and again,
 I didn't want her to have any vaccines and we went in for our well-baby check-up at four
 months, and the doctor and the pediatrician ... The pediatrician and the nurse really
 bullied me, and at the time I was dealing with a personal health crisis. My best friend was dying from cancer, she
 was about two weeks away from the time that she actually passed. I knew that she was dying and I was just not
 in a very strong mindset. My husband was at work, he'd been gone for
 a couple of days and I took our little one in for her check-up, and they basically pinned
 me in a corner and said, ""You're a bad mom because you're not giving your daughter her
 shots, and what's the matter with you?"" They gave me this horrific form to sign saying
 that I was basically putting my daughter's life at risk by not choosing to vaccinate
 that day, and so I said, ""Fine, just give me the DTaP."" We'll just do one DTaP because I just felt
 so bullied and so pressured and I remember sitting there holding back tears and not wanting
 to do it. They came in with the needle and I still remember
 it going into her leg, and I still remember the feeling in my gut and wishing that I hadn't,
 I would have stood my ground. We walked out of there and she screamed for,
 it felt like an entire day, but she, from that point on developed a sleep disorder. She didn't sleep for the first 14 months of
 her life. It took me about a year after we started sleeping,
 for me to figure out that it was really from the vaccine that she got. What was interesting was when we switched
 pediatricians and I pulled her medical records, I had asked for the DTaP vaccine and written
 in her charts was the Hib. They gave me a vaccine that I never had asked
 for. It was a completely different vaccine and
 I know that that was the reason why she didn't sleep for the first 14 months of her life. I don't need a doctor to confirm it. I don't need medical data. I'm her mom, I saw it happened. I saw her shift. She would be pain screaming for hours and
 I can't even imagine what would have happened to our precious little girl had we continued
 to vaccinate. With our third child, absolutely not. We declined the Vitamin K shot at birth, which
 I will tell you my girls got because I didn't know better. I even had my Natural Bradley Health Coach
 tell me that it's just a vitamin and they absolutely needed to have it. I didn't question it. I just did the Vitamin K shot at birth with
 both my girls, which I completely regret now, because I know so much more about it. There's Polysorbate 80, there's aluminum,
 and a lot of the different brands, and it's completely unnecessary. With Beau, our youngest we declined that at
 the hospital and an interesting story, we kind of got into an altercation with one of
 the pediatricians about it. He basically told me that I was a bad parent
 again, and that my baby was going to die of a brain hemorrhage and don't come crying to
 him when that happen. I actually told him to get out of my hospital
 room, because one, he wasn't our doctor, he was just a random doctor that came to check
 on us. Over the course of all these experiences,
 during that time when I was still trying to figure it out for myself, I just devoured
 vaccine research. I would spend hours and hours and hours and
 I still do, to this day you will find me on a weekend reading medical journals, reading
 vaccine injury stories, connecting with parents about vaccine injuries. I'm 100% okay with not vaccinating for multitude
 of reasons. The first reason being that a healthy immune
 system doesn't come from vaccines. I'll explain that in a minute, but number
 two, historically looking, when I started to dig into the research of the history of
 vaccines, I was floored because we've all been told the same thing, ""Vaccines are safe
 and effective. They made diseases decline. They save millions of lives."" When I really looked into it, I found not
 only was that not true, but it was the complete opposite because vaccines harm and damage,
 maim and kill way more people than they've ever, ever helped, if any at all. I truly believe that every single person that's
 ever been vaccinated is in fact vaccine injured on some level, because their immune system
 has been disrupted, and we do know that vaccines alter DNA. We've started this whole process of altering
 our genetic make-up by injecting these foreign chemicals and additives and preservatives,
 all these things into our bodies. I'm okay with not vaccinating because immunity
 comes from natural immunity. If my children get chicken pox or they get
 measles, they're going to have life-long immunity. Do I want my children to have those diseases
 and be sick? No, nobody wants to spread disease and nobody
 wants to see someone that they love be sick, but if they get those things we're going to
 treat them naturally. We're going to do the things necessary to
 keep their bodies balanced during that time, but it's just like a fever. People freak out when their kids have a fever. A fever is a body's natural response of fighting
 infections. Our bodies are intuitive, they're amazing,
 they're divine, and for us to think that we can create something pharmaceutically based
 that's going to be more protective than what nature has already delivered for us is completely
 ridiculous. When I started to dig in to the history, and
 I mean going back to the small pox vaccine, learning about the true causes of polio. You guys, polio, what we've been sold as polio
 is not really polio, and polio in the United States was actually caused from government
 corruption and spraying DDT and arsenic and putting arsenic in our food and all that stuff. The only known cases of polio in the world
 now are vaccine induced polio from the oral polio virus. It's really important to know that all the
 answers are there, we just need to look for it. We don't need to be scared. We don't need to be scared of disease. The entire pharmaceutical industry is built
 on a house of cards and the underground of that is fear. If they project fear out on to the entire
 population, people get scared and they're like, ""Ohh, we need to go get this vaccine
 right now to protect ourselves."" No, trusting your body, trusting nature, and
 trusting God if you're a spiritual person, trust in how we were created to fight disease,
 to fight infection, to fight disease and illness. Think about this, when you cut your finger,
 I cut my finger the other day and I had a little cut. Now I didn't really put anything on it except
 for coconut oil, but my body healed it. My body knew what to do, I didn't have to
 create something different. My cells and everything knew what to do. How we stop disease and how we prevent disease
 in our homes is we boost natural immunity. We do that by putting good organic nutrients
 into our system every single day, water, sunshine, air, rest, sleep, all of these things, and
 that will fortify the immune system. That's what will protect us against disease
 and illness, not a fake injection. The other thing is this, is vaccines have
 proven over and over again to cause more harm that good. We know that this is happening, as the vaccine
 schedule has increased it's tripled over the last 15 years. We have the biggest epidemic of children that
 are sick, ever in our history. We have kids with allergies, asthma, auto-immune
 issues, neurological issues, seizure disorders. If I could tell you how many parents reach
 out to me on a weekly and monthly basis ... Sorry, I'm going to get emotional. The stories that I have heard of vaccine injury,
 you can't even wrap your mind around what these human beings have been through because
 of vaccines. It is not normal for a child to have a seizure. Parents have just been handed that, that it's
 normal and they call their pediatricians asking for help and their pediatrician say, ""Oh,
 don't worry about it. It's normal for a child to have seizures."" It is not normal for a child to have seizures,
 and seizures are caused by vaccination. If you don't believe me read the inserts because
 it's on each and every insert, it will say that the vaccine causes seizures. We have this epidemic of doctors that think
 they know better than the parents and they're also being lied to from the pharmaceutical
 industries, and we have this epidemic of children that are the poor innocent victims in all
 of these and they're being mutilated, you guys, mutilated. If I'm just one person, I'm just one person,
 I'm just one mom in the world on social media talking about this and I have hundreds and
 hundreds and hundreds parents coming to me, to tell me their stories, that should make
 everyone look around and go, ""What is going on?"" If you're a parent and you're watching this
 video, I really want you to go inside and go into your intuition and ask yourself what
 does your gut tell you, because I think so often we're programmed by big pharma to not
 listen to our gut of what the right decision is for our health, whether it's for our own
 bodies or for the bodies of our children. I really encourage you to do your research. Please, please, please do your research. There is a plethora of research out there. To start, go to www.StopMandatoryVaccination.com. Larry Cook has put together a multitude of
 resources on there, there's articles. I've written an article on there and there's
 other amazing people that have written articles on there. There's so much research, you guys, that we
 are in an age of information and being ignorant about this, it's not an option for us anymore. We need to understand what's happening in
 the pharmaceutical industry. We need to understand what's happening in
 our bodies and we need to understand what the best course of action is for our children
 to keep them healthy, because the bottom line is this, is big industry doesn't care about
 you. They don't care about your family, they don't
 care about your health, all they care about is profit. If you don't want your child, your family,
 yourself to become a statistics in that industry then I would encourage you with everything
 in my heart to opt out of that system, opt out of the agenda. Get educated, just like you would research
 a car seat or a school or whatever it is for your child, research vaccines like your child's
 life depends on it, because it really, truly does. In closing, I just want to say this, that
 we are bright, we are amazing, and we are powerful human beings and the longer we let
 the pharmaceutical industry and our government control that aspect in our lives, to make
 decisions for us, to think that we're too stupid to understand the body or what the
 body needs, I really want to encourage you to know that you have the resources to do
 that. You are bright. You are smart. You can do the research and the bottom line
 is this, you probably are going to do more research than your doctor has ever done regarding
 this issue. Be the best advocate for your health and for
 your children every single day, whether that's eating organic food, whether that's cleansing
 your body, whether that's saying no to vaccines, and just know that you're not alone. Sometimes it can feel like you're alone when
 you start this journey, but there are millions of us that are starting to wake up, starting
 to speak out, and we're starting to go against the agenda of just listening to whatever we've
 been told or fed, because most of that has been a lie."
1,"thank you all for being here last time I was here I had just made the film back it was out we're talking about the fraud at the CDC for those of you that have not seen backs very simply I was a producer on the daytime talks to the doctors where I worked for six years I wanted an Emmy Awards celebrating the best that medicine has to offer best doctors best scientists cutting edge technologies I am a fan of doctors I'm a fan of science and I want to state that right up front I ran into the story of dr. William Thompson the CDC whistleblower who came forward in 2015 and said they'd committed scientific fraud on the MMR autism study that they saw a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism then they hid it from the public that's essentially what the film is about you haven't seen it's extremely compelling I think it's going this story is up there with Watergate or any other government cover-up only this time children are in harm's way what I'm gonna present to you today is really where I've been since then you know when I would travel the country with backs we got a big bus that said backs on the side of it and we were interviewing parents of vaccine injured children all across America and they're everywhere filling up theaters everywhere we went and but the question that kept coming to me was always is it just the MMR vaccine Dell is it because the film is very specifically about the measles mumps rubella vaccine I didn't really have an answer to that I could say that anecdotally more parents came up to the bus and claimed that their child got autism from the DTaP vaccine then actually said the MMR vaccine which our film was about they would always say you know we never got the MMR vaccine our child got autism after DTaP so that you know as a medical journalist and since I was already deep in this and probably destroyed my television career anyway I figured I'm just gonna keep investigating vaccine safety and that's what I've done I think I don't know that any other journalist has ever spent as much focused energy and time on looking at vaccine safety than me I'm three years in now it's all I look at it's all I study I'm not alone I work with brilliant people like Robert Kennedy jr. Lynn redwood of the world Mercury project mark black soul just the list goes on and on above you know the the great mind scientist doctors lawyers that are all investigating this so that's the information I'm going to present to you today in fact what you're about to see today is a presentation that we gave at the National Institute of Health many of you may have remembered Donald Trump made a statement that he was going to put Robert Kennedy jr. as the head of a vaccine Safety Commission that didn't necessarily transpire the way that we had thought but this meeting was set up by Donald Trump and we got to present before Francis Collins the head of National Institute of Health Tony Fauci head of our infectious disease division of CDC FDA HHS all of the really the heads of our health departments were sitting across the table this is what we presented to them so I want you to think about that I'm not just telling you we said this right to their faces and I'll let's give you a sense of what their response was so I'm not trying to make something up we've presented our issues with this vaccine program and the the answers are really deplorable but to get started why am I here I wouldn't be here if we had the healthiest kids in the world I don't think that there would be any argument people say you're crazy to argue vaccines have made us so healthy really look at this headline this is out of 2000's happened in 2013 US has highest first-day infant mortality out of industrialized world group reports in fact that went on to say we have more babies die on the first day of life the United States of America we have 50% more die on the first day of life then every other industrialized nation combined combined we cannot keep a day one old baby alive think about that how does that make any sense do we not have the best doctors in the world do we not have the best hospitals in the world something's wrong if you like well that's 2013 no one's ever really said the stats gotten better and then this came out just three weeks ago American kids seventy percent more likely to die before adulthood than kids in other rich countries the opening sentence a new study ranks 20 wealthy countries on childhood deaths the u.s. comes in last there are 20 countries that may have as much money or less than we do and their children are healthier and not dying at 70 that's 70% more likely to die I mean makes no sense so I always say I'm not a doctor I'm just a journalist I investigate things that don't make sense to me and then I get into it how is this possible if vaccines have made us so healthy why are our children dying and people say well how do you know it's back to use it as a problem maybe it's food maybe it's water maybe it's air okay we could talk about that to ensure I'm sure people here at this conference will be talking about that but the problem is is why is in our news talking about these numbers if it is food why is it Sanjay Gupta talking about it if it is water why isn't you know Rachel Maddow complaining about it why is no one talking about the fact that our children are dying at alarming rates in what is supposed to be the most advanced greatest country on Earth all right let me start with this is how the program started at National Institute of Health this is a study that was done last year 2017 it came out one of the big arguments we make about determining whether vaccines are causing the issues we see in society or not is the VAX versus on vac study we feel like if you just took the databases we are sitting on if there are National Institutes of Health and CDC and ran all the unvaccinated children against the vaccinated children and say what are the health outcomes is there higher rates of cancer than the vaccinated as their higher autism is their higher multiple sclerosis the list goes on and on it's the simplest study known to man well they have refused to do that for decades but this guy Peter AAB there's a doctor who is the head of our vaccine program in third-world countries I don't at least a head but he's deeply involved has been vaccinating third world nations for decades he decided just this year to look back 30 years at a DTP program that diphtheria tetanus pertussis vaccine the reason being he was looking through the the numbers and saw that because of the way that they had ruled out that vaccine program for kids three to six months old they were so specific about the age and then the towns that they could get to and how they could get to them that he said oh my god I have a perfect control study I have half the children three to six months old got the DTP vaccine in guinea-bissau Africa and half did not and I can compare these two groups well what he discovered when he compared them was DTP was associated with a fivefold higher mortality than being unvaccinated all currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria tetanus and pertussis meaning the deaths were not they were not tetanus they were not diphtheria or pertussis they were dying of other things malaria dysentery things that they would normally be able to fight off and the conclusion was perhaps this vaccine is is efficacious when it comes to diphtheria tetanus and pertussis but it's hurting the immune system to fight off other issues in fact the numbers got worse it was fivefold when they got the oral polio at the same time when they just got diphtheria by about DTP by itself ten times the rate of death ten times the rate of death that's murder really accidental murder now I want to remind you that this vaccine we used to use an American but we've discontinued it we now use DTaP because there were so many lawsuits against the pharmaceutical industry for the whole-cell pertussis the DTP vaccine we switched over in the 90s and so we don't use this vaccine anymore but we use it all over third world our question to the National Institute of Health after showing this is this had we not looked back thirty years we wouldn't know that this vaccine is killing children our concern is that in America we are giving 72 vaccines 16 different vaccines over 72 doses to be specific to our children by the time there what surveillance system is in place to capture if one of our vaccines is destroying immune systems like this one apparently is or the combination of our vaccines do our health institutions really monitoring how vaccines are working in society or not that's our question and what we pointed out we set them right up front I think you're going to be alarmed to find that the conflicts of interest and the type of science being done leaves us with a really terrifying notion that we have nothing in place to see if this isn't happening in America all right now these are just a short list of vaccine adverse events that we essentially admit to on one way or another vaccine Court has paid out for guillain-barre a sentence remand transverse myelitis which are both paralytic diseases we say we've eradicated polio those used to be considered polio by the way until we got better diagnosis so that can paralyze you encephalopathy seizures disorders chronic inflammatory demyelinating diseases rheumatoid arthritis and then below this is the list of vaccine insert side effects so this is on the insert wrapped around the vaccine itself things like rheumatoid arthritis tics speech delays you know this is just we just sort of went for the the the smallest most effective versions of this but the list goes on and on and on okay here's where we're at in America one in six children now has a developmental disability a DD ADHD autism hearing loss mental disability seizures stammering it's a terrible number that is not where it was when we were kids and look at this fifty-four percent of children America now have a chronic illness either an autoimmune disease or neurological disorder anxiety problems asthma the bone and muscle disorders chronic ear infections diabetes you've seen it I'm not making this up if you're taking your kid to school or if you're a teacher that's been teaching for the last twenty or thirty years you've watched the health of your children in school just plummet through the floor ATD ADHD one in four kids in our school system is going to leave school on a drug they'll be on the rest of their okay these this is alarming so what is an autoimmune disease since that seems to be what's running rampant 54% of children since they have an autoimmune disease a disease revolting from a disordered immune reaction in which antibodies are produced against one's own tissues as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis even asthma the list goes on and on of autoimmune disease why would our bodies be attacking themselves all of a sudden why didn't why wasn't this the case when you talk to Grandma and Grandpa that guy never heard of such a thing why now does one and two kids have their bodies attacking themselves now again people will say well Dell it could be water it could be air it could be food could be vaccines could be a combination of all these things sure but I want to say this if what's happening is our immune system is confused and attacking our own cells wouldn't it be wise to really investigate the one product that is designed to alter your immune system for life that's what you do when you take a vaccine you were trying to trick your body into thinking it's had a disease is it really that outrageous to think that somewhere in tricking your body to think it's had a disease that did not come fully in contact with it gets confused and starts fighting the wrong parts of your body it's a very layman's perspective and doctors say well that's preposterous really is it preposterous certainly it should have enough logic to it that we investigate it deeply and thoroughly over all other things when we're talking about autoimmune disease here's the numbers in 1986 we got 11 vaccines then we passed the 1986 Compensation Act and we went to 53 vaccines now and as I said 72 doses but look at the same time 12.8% chronic illness developmental disabilities in 1986 54 percent now in 2017 now yes it's aunt anecdotal but those are coterminous they run exactly right next to each other when we look at the health outcomes of our children and yet we still want to listen to news anchors that say it really isn't vaccines where our doctors only say it isn't vaccines my question is how did you prove that how do you know for sure it's not vaccines okay well who is responsible for vaccine safety this is where this issue begins any other product if you have airbag fails we watched till you ought to recall millions of cars a car seat fails we recall millions of car seats in this case Merck if you don't remember Merck made Vioxx it caused heart attacks they knew it they had hit it from the FDA they put out a drug they news cause heart attacks and 65,000 people or more were killed by that drug they've settled for three billion dollars in a lawsuit I'm amazed at any company that knowingly murders American citizens more American citizens by the way than were killed in the Vietnam War I'm amazed that company can even work in America ever again but they happen to make most of your childhood vaccines this wonderful beautiful company that in this court case had emails that said inside of them when doctors were beginning to question why their patients were having heart attacks Merck put out an email to all their marketing agents saying don't worry any doctor that that questions the safety of Vioxx we will hunt them down and destroy them where they live as a quote came out in court internal email that's how that company thinks of citizens and that company as I said makes your childhood vaccines I hope you feel good because that's who's supposed to be in charge of safety until this happened the 1986 vaccine injury compensation act essentially as I said DTP was causing so many lawsuits the manufacturers are saying we can't make money from vaccines anymore and I don't want to just put it all on the pharmaceutical industry there were also parents of injured children that wanted to see some way that we could have a court system that would pay out easier so that they didn't have to try and sue a multi-billion dollar industry and go through appeals processes so the government and Ronald Reagan signed this act reticent Lee he was really nervous about the dangers of taking all liability away from a company than axé products into our babies but he did it and so what was the consequence of that all of a sudden overnight there was no incentive to conduct safety studies by the manufacturers in fact there was a disincentive because in the 86 act the only way you can sue and get outside of this law is if they recognize an adverse event that they do not report so think about that if you're a company you say okay well hold on a second so if we do safety studies and find that we have an adverse event and we don't report it we can be sued if we don't do any safety studies at all just put this on the market we are free and clear from liability that's right who thought of that think about how dangerous that is so once you're free from liability of a 78 million American children as soon as you get your vaccine put on the childhood schedule 78 million customers automatically overnight because of our mandating laws I don't know how many of you are entrepreneurs or create some sort of product can you imagine being able to lobby the government to force your product in the hands of every child in America I mean Cabbage Patch dolls they would have ruled the world okay and obviously there's a strong incentive to do what develop more vaccines because it's become so financially viable you can't get sued you don't have to advertise because the government's gonna force them onto people and so what happens there we are 11 vaccines in 1986 this is what it looks like now in 2017 and by the way there's 270 vaccines in the pipeline you haven't heard about yet and thousands of vaccine trials going on as we speak I'm here to tell you this is the future of the pharmaceutical industry for all the reasons I've said is the most profitable product the pharmaceutical industry has you can sue for Vioxx you can sue for oxycontin but you can't super vaccines and you don't even have to advertise and by the way pharmaceutical industry is the number one most powerful lobby in Washington today as we speak they are out spending oil and gas two-to-one wrap your head around that why does the pharmaceutical industry need to be buying politicians at the rate of 2 one over energy where are they going do you think they're trying to push a drug or maybe just maybe they really like their product that they can force on the schedules and mandate them for the American population if you go to Health and Human Services website you will find this is not just about kids they have something called healthy people 2020 and the goal was by 2020 to have a mandatory vaccine program for all adults - that's where the money is when you investigate a story as a journalist what's the one question always ask where's a lawyer follow the money where does the money go this whole push to mandate vaccines and children the flu and the scare and then the measles outbreaks it's not about trying to get 2% of these kids vaccinated that aren't vaccinating that's not worth anything it's about 320 million Americans being turned into human ATM machines for the pharmaceutical industry that's where this is going and so who is gonna deal with this when this is what our schedule ends up being because these people will vaccinate for every microbe and piece of Flint or fleck on the planet if they can who is going to test all these for safety before they hit the market who's in charge of that Health and Human Services this is how this works the 1986 Act takes all liability away from the industry puts it on Health and Human Services which oversees FDA CDC HRSA and NIH now let's talk about how well that's being done and the conflicts of interest there's a major conflict of interest right up at the bat which is obvious to anyone that looks at it you haven't problem because Health and Human Services through the CDC their primary objective is to stop infectious disease it's a noble objective I'm not putting that down but they have to promote vaccines and they have to distribute vaccines because vaccines is the only way our scientific community right now thinks you stop that's the only way you can stop infectious disease that's the primary goal but then you hand them the job of testing these products for safety we'll look at the problem if you've seen backs you see exactly what happened how do you promote a product to millions of people in fact they buy 5 billion dollars worth of back seems to distribute how do you do that and then do a safety test that finds oh my goodness one of these is really dangerous is hurting children if they publicize that they're terrified that their primary objective of getting you to use a vaccine will go down and there is the ultimate conflict of interest but it gets worse okay how does FDA ACEF this is the face safety of vaccines if you're the website this is what it says vaccines undergo rigorous and extensive testing to determine their safety and effectiveness okay that is true for drugs how did that mean if you look at drugs this is how a drug is approved lipitor had a four point eight year safety review period with a placebo group the scientific method for a for achieving safety in a product that's injected or swallowed is to have a double-blind placebo study in an ER placebo one group gets lipitor the other group gets a sugar pill that's painted just like lipitor neither the scientist nor the people involved in a study know which one they're getting then at the end of the 4.8 years they put it all on a graph on a computer we find out what were the rates of cancer what were the rates of autoimmune disease you know all the different types of questions we have and then it's unmasked and then the scientists and everybody finds out did the drug performance safely as the inert placebo you all had some sense of that if you went to high school science that's how it's done okay it's obvious Enbrel same thing six point six years that got a saline injection now here's the question wouldn't you assume vaccines are going through this exact same process because I know I did I know when I worked on the doctors television show and people said vaccines are dangerous I think well that'd be I mean yeah sometimes things like Vioxx slipped through but I'm not seeing some big lawsuit or something outing vaccines certainly they're going through this process take a look at this this is the hepatitis B vaccine that's given on the first day of life hello welcome to the world you're gasping for your first breath and we're gonna give you your first sexually transmitted disease called hepatitis B by the way just like aids is not you the only way you've contracted is sharing needles or being sexually active with prostitutes or promising with sexual behavior I don't know how you plan on raising your 1 day old infant but hopefully there's gonna be a long time before this vaccine is even needed but look at this safety review period this comes right off of the vaccine insert itself I'm not making this up for days they injected the children and then for days they look good put this on the market the other product so that was GlaxoSmithKline Merck five days and was there a placebo group no no inert placebo to test against to see you know anything they just put this right on the market into day one old babies I don't know how many of you have babies but that is the most fragile human alive and remember what I said at the top we have more babies died on the first day of life than every other industrialized nation combined you know what they don't do they don't give their babies hepatitis B vaccines on day one and look at this polio 48-hour review period and this is great this is another trick they do all we do do placebo studies the placebo group got the DTP vaccine the most deadly deadly vaccine that's killing ten times the amount of kids in Africa was how we approved the polio vaccine one group got the polio vaccine and the other group got DTP they seem to have about the same amount of adverse events and risk profile polio looks good put it on the market you can't make this stuff up and it goes on and on and on this way we literally said to the heads of National Institute of Health CDC HHS are we missing something is there somewhere where a real inert placebo studies being done in a file in a computer system we don't have access to because we believe we'd like to see that and they hemmed in a hard and they sort of shuffle in the chairs and eventually they said no no what no you're not going to show us or no you don't use the scientific method to approve vaccines for safety no we don't use we don't use placebo based studies why this is what they said because it would be unethical that's right unethical because we believe vaccines are so fantastic even a brand-new one before it's ever come on in the market like HPV we're gonna try and fight cancer cervical cancer with a vaccine it's so fantastic even before we get to a safety trial that to have a group of children go through a placebo group for three or four years would be a disservice to them not getting this great new product therefore we don't test them there it is now you can question that science you can ask whether you think that's good science or not but here's what just happened our top health agencies the United States of America just admitted to me Robert Kennedy jr. and 10 other people on our team we have never done a vaccine safety study before we put on the market that's it whatever you want to call it unethical or not you now know your children are part of one of the greatest human experiments in the history of man okay so here's how the process works in order for a vaccine to be approved it has to go through the FDA that group is called the vaccine related biological products Advisory Committee in 2000 the Congress investigated Verbeck is what it's called this is what they found the overwhelming majority of members both voting members of consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industry and committee members were substantial ties to pharmaceutical companies have been given waivers to participate in committee proceedings what types of waivers look at this for instance three out of the five FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in 1997 had financial ties the pharmaceutical companies that were doing what developing different versions of the rotavirus vaccine you had people voting to approve rotavirus to be added to the childhood schedule that were in development with their own rotavirus vaccine one of the five voting members had a ten million dollar contract for a roto virus vaccine and one was the principal investigator for a Merck grant to develop what a rotavirus vaccine these are the people that were Voe saying yes your children need this because we are going to make billions of dollars can you think of a greater conflict of interest I can't okay so once it gets out of the FDA it goes to a sit the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices so the FDA just approved it for the market and now we're gonna put it onto the childhood schedule officially and we want a sip towei on this same thing but think about this vote mandating it to millions once you get this vote once it goes through this committee million seventy eight million children are now gonna be forced to use your product okay you have immunity from liability this is where your immunity comes once it lands on the schedule now you're free from liability you never have to worry about it again you're included in the vaccine for Children Program which even pays you when children are too poor to have the vaccine the government's going to make sure you get paid for every single one of your product that goes out the door alright and once again in the investigation CDC grants blanket waivers to the aesop members regardless of their conflicts it's the a sip reflects a system where government officials make crucial decisions affecting American children without the advice and consent of the governed same thing they went through a list of systemic lack of oversight 97% of the committee members had not even filled out their conflict disclosures part of the the paper when they took the job and then 58% still had unidentified potential conflicts 32 had even when they looked into it had 32 conflicts that were unresolved basically you have the pharmaceutical industry sitting in this pseudo board acting like it's there for your safety voting their own products into your children their own unsafety tested products into your kids here's how the finances break down CDC gets an 11 point five billion with a B dollar budget they buy four point nine billion dollars with the vaccines which they distribute all over the country they're a marketing arm for the pharmaceutical industry they also by the way own over 20 patents in many of your childhood vaccines now so they make money off of every sale of a vaccine still want to have CDC in charge of your safety because if they find a problem with a vaccine their own patent is in do you think they're gonna tell you about it all right and then you've got the revolving door if you watched VAX you know the Julie Gerber Dean was the head of the CDC at the same time that this MMR study that proves to be a fraud looking at MMR and autism that was a Merck product Julie Gerber ding oversaw this study which basically kicked kids off of the study manipulated study committed a complete and total scientific fraud and what happened with her after that she goes on to work for Merck as president of the vaccine department at 2.5 million dollar salary congratulations job well done Julie you exonerated merckx products and now you're the head of their company ok let's talk about vaccine Court for a second I know I'm dumping a lot on you but people will always say well where's your data where's your probe I'm laying the data on you and at the end I will give you a text message that you can send and you can bring this home and you can look it over we site everything I'm not making this up this is all their own published studies journals all of this is public record ok so the vaccine injury compensation program this is how this court system works there is no judge there is no jury the press is not allowed and all filings are submitted under seal you must fight against HHS now I wanted to think about this this really just hit me this year so you used to sue Merck when your child got seizures or died after a vaccine now when you have to sue for a vaccine injury you're suing the Secretary of Health and Human Services you're suing the government of the United States you have to fight the government to say my child has been injured by a vaccine and who do they use to fight back the Department of Justice lawyers think about how corrupt this is Department of Justice usually is there to fight for the citizens of a country against industries and manufacturers that break laws or break rules and put us in harm's way but in this situation it's turned completely on its head and now they fight you to prove you're crazy you're lying the vaccine did not cause your child or your injury incredible and you must fight without discovery you not allowed to ask to see the safety trials that we've been looking for you're not allowed to ask Merck how did this product get made what happened with it none of that's available to you would be available in a regular court but not for you and this is the best part they don't have to prove that the injury was not caused by the vaccine you have to prove that the injury was caused by the vaccine you being what I mean maybe you work in retail or you sell cars or insurance how are you supposed to know what the science is that caused your what happened right before your eyes your child got a vaccine and then stopped talking three days later stopped walking never was the same person again it is upon you to prove that that was caused by the vaccine and how the only thing they will accept is science you have to find scientific studies that show that the vaccine causes this injury and who was supposed to have done those studies for you Health and Human Services because they're the ones responsible for safety now the very person you're suing the group you're suing is the one that was supposed to have done the safety science so you never had to be in this courtroom to begin with in fact it's like this it's a murder trial where the murderer is the one doing all of the forensics and under those unbelievably extreme circumstances we've still paid out 3.7 billion dollars in injuries to vaccine injury and that is with a cap of 250,000 for pain suffering and death okay so if you solve ax do you remember that William Thompson came forward he was recorded in for several phone calls over four hours of material he also presented congressman Bill Posey with ten thousand documents to back of his claim this was not some guy who was just had an axe to grind to making something up he backed it up with real with real data 10,000 pages he gave to congressman Bill Posey and congressman Bill Posey stood before our Congress and said this in August 2014 dr. William Thompson a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worked with a whistleblower attorney to provide my office with documents related to a 2004 CDC study that examined the possibility of a relationship between mumps measles rubella vaccines and autism in a statement released in August 201 for dr. Thompson stated I regret that my co-authors and I omitted omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the Journal of Pediatrics the co-author scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the study the remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room and reviewed and went through all the hard copy documents that we had thought we should discard and put them in a huge garbage Crean however because I assumed it was illegal and would violate both FOIA "

-1,"hi everyone welcome to Forbes flash it's a big week for us here at Forbes we launched our 33rd annual billionaires list it always makes for an exciting day in the office as the world catches up with more than 2,000 names on the list for only the second year in a decade the number of billionaires in the world and their total wealth shrank proving that even the richest of the rich aren't immune to economic forces and weak stock markets but don't worry they'll be ok combined their wealth comes in at a cumulative eight point seven trillion dollars it's probably no surprise to any of you that the trio of Jeff Bezos Bill Gates and Warren Buffett sit at the top of the list though Bezos might lose his number-one spot once his divorced wife McKenzie goes through the richest woman in the world Francois Betancourt Myers comes in at 15th overall the L'Oreal heiress who is also the chairwoman of her family's holding company has a fortune of forty nine point three billion dollars this is her second year on the billionaires list and her fortune is up 7.1 billion thanks to stellar results at the make of giant we estimate that 90% of her wealth is tied to shares of the company and of course I have to talk about another woman who can attribute her fortune to a successful cosmetics company making her Forbes billionaire list debut this year is kylie jenner the 21 year old is the youngest self-made billionaire ever younger even than Marko Zuckerberg when he hit the 10 figure milestone jenner started Kylie cosmetics in 2015 which fueled in part by an exclusive distribution deal with Ulta is now worth at least nine hundred million dollars Kylie owns all of it and her overhead is miniscule with manufacturing packaging sales fulfillment finance and PR all outsourced and the brand doesn't need to spend much on marketing thanks for following on social media of more than 175 million Jenner can share updates about new products and more with a few swipes on her phone as soon as the news of Kylie's billionaire status broke this week the internet had a field day with it fans and critics alike the most common feedback how could forbes consider someone who grew up in the spotlight with a wealthy family self-made fair question so let me explain how our wealth editors define self-made the Forbes definition refers to someone who established a fortune on his or her own rather than inheriting it but within that there's a range of life circumstances that impact someone's ability to make it as one says so we have a 1/2 and scoring system to address accordingly someone who inherits their fortune scores a 1 someone who works their way up to the top against hardships and after growing up poor like Oprah what scored 10 Kylie Jenner has not inherited her fortune remember she owns all of Kylie cosmetics but she does come from a wealthy family and has used her fame to her advantage so she scores a 7 you can catch up on all of her coverage and the conversations around the list at hashtag Forbes billionaires Kylie aside there's another piece of billionaire related news from this week after months of speculation Michael Bloomberg announced on Tuesday that he will not run for president in 2020 the ninth richest person in the world according to our latest list the former New York City Mayor will still likely have a large influence on the election he plans to spend five hundred million dollars of his own money to defeat Trump adding to the 100 million dollars he spent on behalf of Democrats in the 2018 midterms sound like a lot of money remember this is from a guy worth an estimated 55 point six billion dollars we still could have a billionaire versus billionaire race though as long as Howard Schultz remains a potential candidate and now to wrap things up this week I have to share a major story that has absolutely nothing to do with billionaires I know so generous and this is a big one a new study published in the annals of internal medicine confirms what countless studies have already shown there is no link between autism and the MMR vaccine the scale of the study is what's impressing people it involved following more than 650,000 children over more than 10 years within the duration of the study six thousand five hundred and seventeen children developed autism but the researchers found absolutely no difference in the risk of developing autism between children who had the MMR vaccine and those who didn't the timing of this is interesting as we're seeing a dangerous rise in the anti-vaccine or in the world according to the World Health Organization people who are reluctant or refused to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines are one of the ten biggest threats to human health in 2019 here's hoping this study changes some minds thanks for joining us this week as always I hope you check out the billionaire list let me know what you find most interesting by sharing with hashtag Forbes flash I'll see you next week you you"
-1,a massive decade-long study out this week confirmed once again what scientists have known for years there is no link between vaccines and autism in the 1950s measles infected some 3 million Americans a year a vaccine changed all that in 1963 and by 2000 officials declared the disease eliminated from the US but it's made an unexpected comeback do to anti vaccine sentiment the percentage of my patients who aren't completely vaccinated is probably close to 25% that's pretty high it's pretty high dr. leak voice is highly attuned to the vaccine culture war today he's vaccinating two of his patients his practice is in Vancouver Washington the epicenter of an ongoing measles outbreak since the beginning of the year there have been 70 confirmed cases here how bad is measles measles a bad illness if you are exposed to someone with the measles you're not vaccinated you have a 90% chance of getting it most people don't die from it but about 2 out of a thousand do which is scary oh and that's your kid who's sick when a parent comes in and says I know no vaccines I don't want to do any of them how do you approach that when I started 10 years ago I got pretty fired up by that I mean I was fresh out of residency and I would come at them with all the science all the studies of how safe it was how bad those diseases could be and I get into 2030 minute conversations about that and how would that go they listened politely they'd nod their head and they refused all the vaccines people know I'm not going to kick them out so maybe I attract a few more of those patients and other doctors but you see that as an opportunity absolutely I want to work with those families good talking Hudson what will have to decide on today is what we want to do with flu vaccine if I had my flu shot and he's breastfeeding does that help him at all or just yeah so so not really resting helps with everything that makes him less likely to get sick in general but specifically for the flu not so much then yeah have you actually had success in changing parents minds yes serese wilson is one of those parents who changed her mind I have had an opportunity to meet one of your patients serese and she has gone through a journey you tell me how that actually happened like most parents she's nervous about some things but really nervous about vaccines just in her social group she had gotten a lot of information in both directions and we just talked about it a little bit we said I'm never gonna force you to do anything we're gonna talk about it now we're gonna talk about it in two months and four months I gradually saw serese and her husband become more comfortable with vaccines over those first few months you know yeah it wasn't autism that was never the fear and that I was more concerned about you know you're here about brains well it looked really scary things when did you first hear about the measles outbreak my sister had called me to tell me that there were a few confirmed cases in the area and what was your reaction oh cerise reconsidered her stance shortly before the outbreak her mother was diagnosed with cancer in October of last year so she decided to vaccinate her baby 15 month old Evert to prevent him from making her mother sick I had to weigh the decision how would I feel if he got something that there's a vaccine for and I didn't do it is Everett currently on track right now with his vaccines by 18 months he'll be caught up you said you've done the research you had also been doing a lot of research beforehand so it kind of sounds like your your opinion of the sources that you trust has also changed well when there's emotions involved it's hard for concrete facts to actually influence you because anxiety is a real thing how divisive is this issue in your community I have just been horrified at how vindictive it's been people that I have always appreciated seeing them on social media calling people that don't vaccinate baby-killers some of those messages are directed at Cerises mother Linda Wilson she's a state senator representing parts of Clark County because my mom hasn't discussed the legislation just recently people have gone online and called her a coward and a stupid senator Wilson plans to vote no on e proposed bills that would eliminate one of Washington's non-medical vaccine exemptions the philosophical exemption where do you stand on vaccines well obviously I'm I'm I can be probe at Pro vaccine because I did vaccinate my kids I do believe that we need to do those but I don't believe that everyone should be having to do them when the outbreak erupted in Clark County the number of measles vaccinations administered to children spiked to five times the average the government didn't make them do that they went a measles outbreak did right they decided to make that decision on their own to go get the measles vaccine so what it took an outbreak for that to happen is that how things should go the cases are coming from out of the country so you know maybe what we should do is start thinking about requiring vaccinations if you're coming into our country maybe they should be vaccinated instead of requiring all of our people to be vaccinated regardless why does it make more sense to ask people who are coming into the country to get vaccinated as opposed to people inside the country well they're being responsible here inside the country right we're very well vaccinated sorry I'm I I find that a very interesting way of looking at things because clearly Clark County is actually not well vaccinated if the bar for responsibility is to vaccinate children then saying that we should force people outside of the country to do it as opposed to people inside of the country it sort of seems contradictory if that's where the disease is coming from that's where I'm thinking that we should be looking at what is your responsibility as a politician my responsibility is to listen to my constituents and to hear both sides of an issue I mean there's been so few deaths along the way in years and years because vaccines work no I'm talking about measles people that got the measles there's very very few deaths but there have been more reactions to the measles vaccine and and causing illness in whatever case it is you believe that you believe that vaccines that the measles vaccine has caused greater violation to them might have ended harm than the measles itself I think that in this case yes have you talked to any doctors scientists about this not kind of busy up here and so I I'm just dealing with what I what I'm getting from my constituents you
-1,hi everyone and welcome to microbial minutes this is the American Society for Microbiology update on what's hot in the microbial sciences i'm julie wolfe science communications specialist and this is the vaccines don't cause autism addition of microbial minutes for March 12th 2019 just a reminder that news and opinions presented do not necessarily represent the views of the American Society for Microbiology all right diving right in we're going to talk about a story on our second slide that a comprehensive and longitudinal study that has found no link between vaccines and autism this is important to address because vaccine hesitancy is on the rise we've previously discussed this in microbial minutes sessions and the World Health Organization has actually listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health because of an increased susceptibility to vaccine preventable diseases that is emerging in areas where those diseases were previously eradicated now the link between vaccines and autism and in particular the measles mumps and rubella or MMR vaccine and autism has been debunked in multiple studies however this is perhaps the largest and longest term of all of those studies in this new study published in the annals of internal medicine the nationwide cohort of all children born in Denmark between January 1st 1999 and December 31st 2019 were followed that's 657 thousand children which is a huge number now several thousand of those were excluded you can see that inclusionary and exclusionary criteria listed in the figure on the right-hand side and the of the remaining children that was still six hundred and forty four thousand children so a very large number each of the children were given each other every child was given an identifier and tracked with their vaccine use vaccines in in Denmark are free and voluntary and none of the vaccines that were used contain thimerosal this is important to note because several people several groups in the vaccine hesitancy movement have claimed that same aerosol because of the trace amounts of mercury associated with it is associated with neurological development disorders now none of the vaccines that are used in the United States have contained same aerosol for decades and neither did the vaccines in this study in addition to tracking their vaccine use the scientists tracked the neurological development of these children and they placed it into several different categories they noted whether children developed autistic disorder atypical autism Asperger syndrome another other pervasive developmental disorder or an unspecified pervasive developmental disorder and then they looked at the association of these developmental disorders with vaccines so if we move to our third slide you'll see on the right hand side the longitudinal study so the the children were followed not just one year or two year after vaccination but continuously throughout the entire study so that some children had nearly a decade and a half worth of following to see how their neurological development tracked over that period of time and you can see there is no significant difference in the proportion of developmental disorder children who have these these neurological disorders in either vaccine or unvaccinated children so that there's no association that you can see from this no more striking is when we look at the hazard ratio so a hazard ratio looks at the likelihood of an event or an outcome occurring relative to a control group so how many more times for example is one likely to develop autism given different different factors and those factors are listed in this chart on the right hand side and if there is no increase in in probability then that hazard ratio should say 1 there is no more likelihood of developing back autism based on whatever this factor is if we look specifically at sex here we're comparing the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated children and this additional factor so here male children who are vaccinated are no more likely to develop neurological mental disorders than those who are unvaccinated and if we look at female children you can see there's actually a decrease in the likelihood of development developing a neurological disorder when vaccinated compared to unvaccinated but very very slight the only striking increase in probability of developing a disorder in neurological developmental disorder is one that has previously been established when a child has a sibling with autism they are much more likely to themselves develop autism and you can see that denoted with a much higher hazard ratio with the red arrow pointing to it so the authors ended their study by stating in conclusion our study does not support that MMR vaccination increases the risk for autism that MMR vaccination triggers autism in susceptible children or that MMR vaccination is associated with clustering of autism pieces after vaccination so if we go to the last slide here we will see that this has been written up in a number of major outlets it's covered in the Washington Post it was covered in the New York Times and in that Times article a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics summarized the risk of repeating a myth such as vaccines and their association with autism stressing the importance of discussing the prevention of infectious diseases with parents rather than necessarily giving very long complicated explanations about vaccines and autism this is a particularly heartbreaking issue when one considers that there are ongoing epidemics of measles in places that have no access to or very very little access to the vaccine such as in Madagascar where tens of thousands of children have been infected and several hundred have died due to measles infection and lack of access to the preventable to the the disease preventing vaccine within the United States one of the measures that is being taken to decrease the number of unvaccinated children is to make it a little more difficult to get a vaccine exemption and there have been several hearings on this within Congress ASM has released several statements that we will link to down below and you can read for yourself both these statements that ASM has released as well as a first-hand account of someone an ASM staff member who sat in on that on that Senate hearing with that I'd like to thank you for listening if you want to attend future microbial minutes sessions and know when they're going to come go ahead and subscribe and you'll get those notifications I'd like to thank Rae Ortega for production and I will be with you next time on microbial minutes

 Barckley Toole, life is non-stop with 4 kids. WE'VE GOT GYMNASTICS, WE'VE GOT
 DIVING WE'VE GOT BASKETBALL - SOMEWHERE IN THERE,
 THERE'S HOMEWORK! To help stay healthy
 they exercise, eat right, and get enough sleep, because,
 let's face it, NOBODY HAS TIME TO BE SICK IF YOU'RE
 A MOM Or a dad. WE NEED TO TAKE CARE
 OF OURSELVES. So, they both also
 need to get vaccinated. WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
 YOU GOT VACCINATED? SO I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO
 GET THE FLU VACCINATION, BUT ARE THERE OTHER
 VACCINES THAT I NEED TO BE GETTING, AS AN ADULT? YES, VACCINES AREN'T
 JUST FOR CHILDREN, ADULTS NEED VACCINES AS WELL. SOME VACCINES DON'T GIVE
 YOU LIFE-LONG PROTECTION. AND AS ADULTS GET OLDER,
 THEY MAY BE AT HIGHER RISK OF DISEASES BECAUSE OF
 THEIR AGE, THEIR JOB, TRAVEL OR THEIR HEALTH
 CONDITIONS. What vaccines do healthy
 adults need besides the annual flu shot? First off, if you didn't get the
 whooping cough vaccine called Tdap as a preteen or teen,
 you're due for it now. WHOOPING COUGH IS A
 BACTERIAL INFECTION AND IN BABIES IT CAN MAKE
 IT HARD FOR THEM TO BREATHE AND CAN BE LIFE THREATENING. (Dragon...) WELL I WORK IN A
 PRESCHOOL AND I'M AROUND YOUNG CHILDREN
 ALL THE TIME. AND IF THEY WERE TO COME DOWN
 WITH WHOOPING COUGH OR SOMETHING THAT I COULD HAVE BEEN
 VACCINATED AGAINST AND PREVENTED, I WOULD HAVE FELT
 HORRIBLE So, Mary Beth is here for that whooping cough vaccine, which also contains the
 needed 10 year booster for tetanus and diphtheria. THESE MAY SEEM LIKE
 ILLNESSES FROM THE PAST, BUT THEY ARE SERIOUS DISEASES
 THAT STILL AFFECT US TODAY. IMMUNIZATION IS
 YOUR BEST PROTECTION AND SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS
 FROM VACCINES ARE VERY RARE. IN YOUR 60S, YOU'LL NEED
 VACCINES TO HELP PREVENT AGAINST PNEUMONIA
 AS WELL AS SHINGLES. SO I HAD A FRIEND AT
 WORK THAT GOT SHINGLES AND SHE SAID IT WAS
 EXTREMELY PAINFUL. Next stop for the Tooles? Barckley's Frisbee match. YAY, (CLAPPING) AS I GOT OLDER, I LEARNED THAT I'M NOT
 THE INVINCIBLE 23 YEAR OLD THAT I THOUGHT I
 WOULD BE FOREVER. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO
 LOOK AFTER MY HEALTH. MOMMY WHAT'S THIS BAND AID ON YOU? REMEMBER GOING TO THE
 DOCTOR AND GETTING A SHOT? YES MOMMIES AND DADDIES HAVE TO
 GO GET THEIR VACCINATIONS TOO. AND THEN I CAN STAY
 HEALTHY TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. OK OH, I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH. Find out what vaccines you need

-1,"vaccines have been called the greatest public health achievements of the past century but they're actually a rather old idea a thousand years ago physicians practice variolation to fight smallpox they crushed up scabs from smallpox victims and blew that powder into patients noses after a mild illness these patients developed immunity centuries later in 1798 English doctor Edward Jenner deliberately infected healthy people cow pox producing smallpox immunity the coming centuries brought rapid progress in vaccinology 1877 general theory of disease first proposed 1930 cell culture practices allow for the production of viruses 1979 smallpox is eradicated global 1988 World Health Assembly vows to eradicate polio globally the number of polio cases decreases from 350,000 to just 187 in 2012 2005 the CDC announces rubella is no longer endemic in the US and the list goes on but how effective are vaccines or remember Edward Jenner who infected people with cow pox he's credited with saving over 530 million lives with his smallpox vaccine the secret behind vaccinology is basic trickery vaccines contain a weakened bacterium or virus that mimics natural infection triggering an immune response from the body the immune system rapidly builds an army of cells designed to attack that specific infection destroying the weakened invaders before they cause damage a number of specialized immune system cells remain called memory cells that can quickly detect and destroy any later encounters with the disease it's like target practice for your immune system and with many vaccines miss immunity lasts for life it arose long as vaccines have been fighting disease there have been groups campaigning against the practice during it were Jenner's time people actually believed using cow pox to inoculating at smallpox would turn patients into cows more recently groups have claimed that toxins found within vaccine cause autism but many studies involving hundreds of thousands of children all strongly point out no correlation between vaccines and autism and in 2009 the US Court of Federal Claims ruled that the Marisol containing vaccines do not cause autism despite all the evidence for the safety of vaccines one survey found that one out of four parents have delayed at least one vaccine for their children a dangerous effective vaccine refusal is the return of diseases once thought eradicated the CDC announced the eradication of measles in 2000 but in 2011 220 Americans became infected the largest number in 15 years two-thirds of those infected to never receive the measles vaccination currently vaccine preventable disease rates are at less than 1% of the pre vaccine era in the US but this could change of vaccine refusal spreads yet researchers are continuing their efforts to make the world a healthier place they're working hard on developing vaccines for threats like HIV and malaria cheaper vaccines that can be delivered to poorer areas more effective vaccines with stronger and longer-lasting immune responses and more efficient vaccine delivery systems there are still many diseases out there waiting for us to let down our guard some are just a plane ride away but with proper education and continued research they can be beat because we're all in this together"
-1,hi I'm dr. Susan ream I'm vice chair of the department of infectious disease at Cleveland Clinic and it's my pleasure to talk with you this morning about vaccines for adults when we grow up we think that we're not going to be needing vaccines anymore we think that vaccines are just for kids but what I'm going to do over the next 20 minutes or so is to show you that not only do adults need vaccines but as a population we really are under vaccinated and it's something we need to to work on I want to disclose that I have been a member of scientific advisory boards for Merck and for Pfizer which manufactured vaccines and so our objectives today are to recognize the fact that there are low vaccination rates among adults to look at the CDC adult immunization schedule and learn how to use it and to list the recommendations for various types of immunizations that adults should get many of us grew up in the area where vaccines were not available for lots of childhood illnesses and I certainly remember standing in line as a child to get my oral polio vaccine at a school on a Sunday afternoon it was a miracle and now we've gotten to the point that people don't necessarily recognize vaccine preventable diseases and they don't necessarily know where we've come from as far as vaccines are concerned as a matter of fact unfortunately there are some for children where adults are more afraid of the vaccine than they are of the illness itself and nothing should be further from the truth we know that adults don't know as much about vaccine indications and vaccine preventable diseases as they should know now on the left-hand portion of the slide you'll see in red the 2009 level of knowledge of influenza and chickenpox a course which was was pretty high and there was some slight increase nonetheless in knowledge about these two common diseases when we surveyed again in 2010 but over on the right-hand side of the slide when you look at things like shingles pertussis hepatitis B meningitis and even HPV adults don't know a lot about them again we took surveys a year apart and while the knowledge about whooping cough or pertussis actually went up quite a bit we still are at very low levels and down at the bottom of the slide you can see that only 20% of adults are recognized pneumococcal disease as something that is important and more importantly vaccine preventable so we have a lot to go on there let me just spend a couple minutes talking specifically about current vaccination rates we know that individuals between age 19 and 64 who are so-called high-risk and I'll talk a little bit about this later have very low vaccination rates for pneumococcal disease less than 20% and even among adults 65 and up where everyone should get vaccinated we're still less than 60% saturation as far as that's concerned tetanus vaccination no matter how you slice it is in the 60s percent and the new tetanus vaccine that includes pertussis vaccine the acellular vaccine where less than 10% in this particular survey hopefully going up with time hepatitis speed vaccine force for kids who are young now they're all vaccinated as they're born but for others who may be at risk is hepatitis B vaccination racer extraordinaire allele oh and then look down at the bottom at shingles vaccine or herpes zoster vaccine again fewer than 20% of people who were in the indicated age 16 up have actually received shingles vaccine this is a busy slide and one that's difficult to read but I would encourage you to go to the CDC website if you type in adult vaccination schedule or vult adult immunization schedule this will come up and the schedule is basically two parts the first side one so to speak is an age based immunization schedule and looking at the color coding you can see who should getting which vaccines at what age and it's a very easy graphic representation followed by something that I think internists use even more and that is a so called in the big indication based vaccination schedule here across the top of the page are listed various conditions or special considerations starting with pregnancy immuno compromising conditions HIV infection and so on down the line and again by vaccine there are indications of who should be getting at what schedule they should be following and so on down the line so I would encourage you to go to this page download the schedules and more importantly download the two pages of notes that go along with this schedule because it's in the notes that you get to the detail some of the rationale some of the new changes and so on if you think this is small font tried the footnotes it would not project very well on a slide but I would encourage you to take a peek at that and what we've done in our clinic is actually to post the schedules and the recommendations on the walls in the patient rooms at that time at that point as people are waiting they can sometimes take a peek at it and ask us questions about it too and we ask everybody who comes in to update us on their immunizations so we've got an accurate record let's start by talking about influenza that's one vaccine that everybody needs every year and again our coverage rates in the United States are low for all adults over 18 years of age only about 45% of people are getting vaccinated against flu and these data are current as of a year ago the data for the 12 to 13 flu season isn't out yet but we think it's going to look pretty much the same the seniors 65 years of age and older do better than the rest of the population in terms of getting vaccinated about 71% of seniors got vaccinated against influenza for the 11-12 in wins a season but we should all be at that range or higher now you look at people with diabetes COPD heart disease asthma while we don't use a risk based indication for influenza vaccinations anymore we do know that complications may be higher among these adults and we know for example that obese adults are at higher risk for complications from influenza as well here again fewer than 50% of these people who are at higher risk actually got vaccinated since 2010 we've had an indication for in Universal vaccination for every one six months of age and older and there's some new terminology here now we have lots of choices in terms of the type of vaccines that adults can get the I IV terminology inactivated influenza vaccine refers to the killed vaccine that traditionally was given by intramuscular injection li IV is the live attenuated influenza vaccine that's the name nasal mist what's new in the last few years are several routes of administration first of all the LA IV can be given to people between age two and age 49 who do not have other medical conditions and that's the nasal vaccine it works it's easy and for people who are afraid of needles it's that it's a good choice intra dermal administration is new in the past few years this is given with a short needle pain is much less than with intramuscular but remember that because the skin is processing the influenza vaccine it is a given that people are going to have more of a local reaction with intra dermal administration than they do with intramuscular there is a high-dose vaccine for individuals who are 65 years of age and up there is a superior antibody level that's generated with this high dose vaccine however the studies are still in process to see whether the rate of influenza actually diminishes as a result of these higher antibody levels this year for 2013 is quadrivalent vaccine that contains two strains of a and two strains of B the inactivated vaccine that the trivalent vaccine contains two a and only one B all of the LA IV manufactured for the 13/14 influenza season will be quadrivalent and there will also be some injectable quadrivalent available as well the CDC has not made a preferential recommendation for quadrivalent for intradermal or for high-dose these are all what they call permissive recommendations so you can have either one and which one you get I think will depend on what your provider has or what what your provider has purchased lots of new technology that we don't have time to talk about today but we can look forward to improved influenza vaccines over the years and I think I'll go very quickly through this slide we talked about the universal recommendation we've talked about la IV and either the high dose or the regular inactivated vaccine is fine for persons 65 years of age and older let's move on to pneumococcal disease pneumococcal disease is actually a very exciting era area because of the major changes in epidemiology in the last decade or 15 years or so as you can see here once conjugate vaccine was introduced to pediatric patients we saw a marked reduction in pneumococcal disease not only in peds but in adults as well and this is likely because the vaccine conjugate vaccine for kids reduces carriage in their throat and this thus probably reduces transmission in that way so we saw an improvement in pneumococcal rates in disease rates in adults as well as in children which was kind of an unexpected result I should say now the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and I'll use a trade name here just because it's important to distinguish between this one and a new one that has become available for adults recently this is Pneumovax ppsv23 it has always been indicated for adults 65 years of age and older and what it does is reduce invasive pneumococcal disease meaning meningitis bacteremic pneumonias and other bacteremia it may help against pneumococcal pneumonia that is something that we need to continue to study now they're also more recently been indications to use pneumococcal vaccine on adults under 65 years of age who have chronic conditions of various types and these are very common conditions that you see in your primary care practices COPD various cardiovascular diseases diabetes chronic renal failure new products and syndrome chronic liver disease asthma cochlear implants CSF leaks and various immuno compromising conditions so not only everybody over 65 needs to get pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine but also this very large group of patients between ages 19 and 65 who have chronic conditions and I should mention a splenius either splenectomy or functionally splinting as well anybody who's a resident of a long-term care facility and all smokers also should receive the polysaccharide vaccine for a subset of of these patients they need to get revaccination with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine so you can see the indications here they get another dose five years after their first dose and then they get one more dose at age 65 so it's a little bit complicated in terms of who gets revaccinated and when but just be aware that some of these individuals who get vaccinated before age 65 will need to be revaccinated with the polysaccharide vaccine now enter Prevnar for adults that's a trade name for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and this vaccine was approved by the FDA now a couple years ago and then recommended by the CDC's ACIP committee a few months ago and the recommendation is that certain individuals with immuno compromising individuals receive both the polysaccharide vaccine and the conjugate vaccine this is probably the newest recommendation I'm going to talk about this morning the conjugate vaccine works in a different way obviously than the polysaccharide vaccine and it's hoped that it will further help in immunocompromised individuals to be safe from various forms of pneumococcal disease so what are these immuno compromising conditions they include things like chronic renal failure functional or anatomic a splenius CSF leaks and other immuno compromising conditions like chronic steroid use HIV use of biologic agents and so on again we're talking about a pretty large group of adults now unfortunately it's a little bit complicated because timing is really important and for an adult who is in the indicated group who has not received any pneumococcal vaccine in the past it's best to give them the the conjugate vaccine first give them Prevnar first if you'd give it the other way around if you give the polysaccharide vaccine first the conjugate doesn't work as well so in someone who's never received any pneumococcal vaccine before gives a conjugate first and then you can give the polysaccharide vaccine eight weeks later if they have had polysaccharide vaccine and I had a patient just this week who'd never had any vaccine before she's Crohn's disease on biologic modifiers and she was given the polysaccharide vaccine when she was hospitalized now we have to wait a year before we can give the conjugate vaccine so it is a little bit tricky we hope that we'll be able to build some things into various electronic medical records and so on that will help you help guide you as far as these things are concerned now I'm going to move on to zoster and the herpes zoster vaccine which is called zoster vaccine the trade name just because I want to make it clear this is not the chickenpox vaccine this is a zoster vaccine why is this so important well you talk to your patients who are older they all know somebody who's had shingles and they know people have had problems with post herpetic neuralgia or PHN after they've had shingles the main thing that the stub acts does is to reduce post herpetic neuralgia that was a primary endpoint it does also reduce shingles itself we know that as age increases for people who gets austere and the risk of zoster goes up with age that the risk of PHN also goes up with age so CDC recommends that everybody 60 years and age and older get zoster vaccine now there's a little bit of a discrepancy you may have heard about the FDA actually approved zoster vaccine for everybody 50 years in age and up the CDC recommends that it be given for 60 enough and this was partly related to supply partly related to risk of illness and so on down the line but just be aware of that and the big question that comes up oh actually there are several questions that come up with with shingles vaccine but one of the big ones is can you vaccinate somebody who's immunocompromised this is evolving for the most part people with various chronic medical conditions can be vaccinated remember this is a live vaccine and it's a higher dose than the chickenpox vaccine but there are contraindications and if you look back on the adult immunization table in the disease based table you can see a red box there that means live vaccine is contraindicated so for example we don't know too many women who are 60 years of age and pregnant but if that were to happen that would be a contraindication and severe immunodeficiency transplant related types of immunosuppression and so on would be something that that we would make a contraindication one other thing that's been in the news quite a bit is pertussis or whooping cough you keep hearing about outbreaks in various parts of the country and while we have made great strides and control of pertussis it is again a problem and there are a couple of reasons for that so the CDC reinforced this recommendation that all adults should get at least one vaccine I should say one is all that's recommended right now of Tdap which is the tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis vaccine in addition very important to those of you who have women of childbearing age in your practice it is indicated to give this vaccine with every pregnancy ideally during the twenty seven to thirty six weeks gestational age for best protection of the baby but one of the reasons that there is such emphasis on this is that the very young and the very old are particularly vulnerable to whooping cough so this is something that where we're talking about a cocooning strategy not only should the mother and dad be immunized but Grandma and Grandpa the baby sitters health care workers everyone who's going to be around a child who may be vulnerable to severe morbidity mortality from whooping cough should be vaccinated as well now just be aware that and this is new information that it appears that one of the reasons that we're seeing more pertussis is that children have been vaccinated with an inactivated or a sux cues me acellular pertussis preparation for several years now and it looks like it wears off a little bit more quickly than the whole cell vaccine the whole cell vaccine was was dropped for adults years ago because it caused so much reaction but the good news is that it was a it seems like it was a more immunizing vaccine so I think whooping koffice is around here now one final recommendation you should know about is a kind of an ish thing but for those of you who practice in skilled cared facilities or have patients who are in skilled nursing facilities you should know about this and that is that people with diabetes should be vaccinated against hepatitis B so we're recommending it for everyone with hepatitis B who are between the ages of 19 and 59 years if they haven't had it before and you may give it to others who are in facilities in particular who have diabetes and are aged 60 years of age and older so here's a summary influence is easy all adults should get it every year Hep B for certain adults including diabetics didn't talk about HPV this morning because that's often handled by pediatricians and OBGYNs but there are recommendations that carry into the adult phase as well we talked about a lot about pneumococcal disease and the new recommendations for use of the conjugate vaccine in some immunocompromised adults the shingles vaccine every one sixty years of age and older and then the Tdap booster should be given to everyone who hasn't had one before and then tetanus revaccination should be given every ten years thanks very much I look forward to talking with you again about specialty areas of vaccinations in adults you
1,mass vaccination it is perhaps the most controversial health issue of our time it affects our children it affects our political systems it has severe impact on parental rights and our personal freedom we have a pipeline of hundreds of vaccines it's a thirty billion dollar a year industry vaccines have been sold very strongly as safe and effective for everybody now the evidence doesn't suggest that the multi dose flu shots still have mercury in them why would you inject something into your little infant that could possibly harm them in exchange for avoiding something as uncomplicated in most cases as the influenza that's going to come and go in a week the policy comes from government and where does the government get their data the government gets their data from the people who make the drugs or the vaccines that's dangerous get Gardasil and your daughter will be one less meaning one less circle cancer victim well in reality she was never going to be a cervical cancer victim we've tripled the numbers of doses of vaccines we're giving our children we have seen this increase in chronic immune and brain dysfunction for the first time on an unprecedented scale top scientific experts and thought leaders from around the world reveal their findings and expertise on this critical sensitive and at times chilling subject the explosive free to view documents revealed is coming on January 10th and will provide daily episodes through January 18th each day will feature new critical vaccine topics and expert presenters free speech about vaccines has been oppressed careers of experts who have revealed the truth about vaccines have been destroyed scandal and corruption within this multi-billion dollar industry is rampant but because of a few brave people the truth is now being told in a way like never before every parent needs to know this information every person considering a flu shot or other vaccines mandated by their employers needs to know the risks and what their rights are join us January 10th through the 18th and don't miss this remarkable and courageous event that dares to tell the unbridled truth about a generation altering subject that literally impacts the lives of our children and all of humanity vaccines
1,oh my god I cannot believe we did what we did but we did it's all there it's all there this is a real story of a real fraud that's the lowest point in my career that I went up along with that paper deliberate high-level deception of the American people with disastrous consequences for its children's health in order to give context to the extraordinary story that you're about to hear a little historical perspective is important many of you will have heard of Tuskegee dirt poor sharecroppers in Macon County Alabama black men with syphilis from 1930 to 339 men were told by the Public Health Service the forerunner of today's CDC that they had bad blood the motive of public health doctors was to study the natural history of syphilis in the black man natural history in this case means deliberately untreated these men were deliberately left untreated even when something as effective as penicillin came along were still those infected were actively prevented by Public Health doctors from getting this life-saving drug men suffered and died women continued being infected and babies continued to be born with congenital syphilis a shiny new CDC took over in the late 1960s refused to stop the experiment not until every last man had been opened up on their autopsy table the experiment was stopped not because the CDC realized the barbaric nature of their enterprise but because a whistleblower by the name of Peter Buxton leaked the story to a journalist at the Washington star the story was published on July 25th 1972 hit the front page of the New York Times then the experiment was stopped shortly thereafter Congressional hearings follow so unethical so inhumane was this public health experiment that it led to a change in the CDC's code of medical ethics except it didn't thirty years later the CDC was to do something arguably far worse over a decade ago dr. Scott Montgomery and I put forward a hypothesis for MMR vaccine and autism the age that you receive the vaccine influences the risk this makes sense for some infections like measles the age of infection changes the outcome we shared this hypothesis with vaccine officials members of the Centers for Disease Control at meetings in Washington DC and Cold Spring Harbor a group of senior vaccine safety people at the CDC studied it it panned out we were right at least partly by November the 9th 2001 nearly 13 years ago senior CDC scientists knew that younger age of exposure to MMR was associated with an increased risk of autism in 2004 they published but they hid the results it's the lowest point in my career that I went along with that paper and I went along with this we didn't report significant findings a memo was declared safe the IOM has evaluated this issue back in 2004 and again most recently in 2011 and you know their conclusion again it was not just looking at the work that was done at CDC but with the total body of evidence was suggesting that vaccines and their components did not increase the risk for autism what dr. choline boiled a co-author of that blighted paper did not tell Congress is that she and her colleagues had deliberately concealed the autism vaccine link from the Institute of Medicine and the public ironically they even received an award from the Secretary of Health and Human Services for this work so troubling was the fraud that one of the CDC researchers broke ranks eventually he made contact with dr. Brian hooker father of a vaccine injured child with autism and a vaccine safety researcher I received a phone call out of the blue it had a 404 area code so I knew it was from the CDC on the whole that was Bill Thompson he had much to confess I'm completely ashamed as what I did I have great shame now I was complicit and I went along with it dr. Thompson had appointed me his priests and when he appointed me his priests then he started confessing and we have had many many phone exchanges we've exchanged dozens of emails and he has released quite compelling information regarding fraud and malfeasance in the CDC we didn't report significant findings Thompson sent hooker information that was never intended for public scrutiny from their own data sheets dated 2001 dr. hooker analyzed the CDC's results and he found the same risk for autism that the CDC scientists had themselves identified it's all there it's all there he confronted Thompson he is expressed significant remorse for lying for burying data I have great shame now when I meet families with kids with autism because I've I have been part of the problem this week August the 10th 2014 dr. hooker published the real findings a 340 percent increased risk of autism in boys receiving the MMR on time compared with those receiving it later thirteen years and tens of thousands of children later but as I've said dr. Montgomery and I were only partly right the risk of autism from early MMR vaccination was seen in black children black boys those boys for some reason are at very high risk consistent with the CDC's own findings the rate of autistic regression in black children is reported to be twice that in white children oh my god I cannot believe we did what we did Tuskeegee revisited scientist dr. David Lewis an international expert in whistleblowing and the detection of scientific fraud reviewed the original CDC documents and the paper they published in 2004 probably this is a clearest case and the easiest case in which to answer is it fraud or is it an accident is it just an artifact of the study that we're dealing with here clearly it's fraud he knows that he's culpable for damage he knows that he's culpable for permanent damage of a large significant portion of the population in the United States the higher-ups wanted to do certain things and I went along with it dr. Frank de Stefano dr. Marshall and Jurgen also dr. : boy they knew they'd let it happen and they could have stopped it Michigan lawyer Allison follmer an award-winning advocate for children and parental rights gave her reaction um I feel first and foremost as a human being you know betrayed when you lose your faith in trust in humanity you know how do you how do you repeal it sooo pianist Thompson is very regretful about his involvement what's the lowest point in my career that I went along with that paper I'm not gonna lie I basically have stopped lying you see violence the crimes of Stalin Pol Pot and Hitler were these men were not hypocrites their motives ambiguous saw their rhetoric glazed with apparent caring and compassion these men were not entrusted with the welfare of their victims then Otto's did not include the words to save lives and protect they were not running a mandatory program disguised as caring how many children how many went to the wall in that decade of silence how many presidents mr. Obama
1,"dr. timpani let's talk about vaccines oh god we have to cover this one I know for a fact that my kids right now got a lot more than I did when when I was their age are these safe no let's talk about the age of there for a second because that's really is a big deal because parents will say well I don't remember getting a lot of vaccines when I was a kid and the truth of the matter is you didn't as recently as 1985 so anyone born before 1985 only had three vaccines there was DPT which is diphtheria tetanus pertussis MMR which is measles rubella and measles mumps and rubella and polio that was it there were three vaccines now there's 16 and there's multiple doses of all 16 of those so the difference is is that back then if you added up all those vaccine antigens like MMR is three vaccine antigens with one shot DPT is three vaccine antigens in one shot polio actually has three viruses in it so it's really three viruses in one shot well each one of those individual viruses are called antigens and if you added up all the sum total of antigens that children got before 1985 if they got all of those all of those vaccines they got 33 vaccine antigens injected into them by the time they started kindergarten up through 2010 they got 156 vaccine antigens and now there's been more vaccines added since then and so it just goes on and on there are measurable amounts of chemicals there are milligram amounts of gelatin and the MMR and then the chickenpox vaccine there are 63 different types of chemicals in these vaccines now not each vaccine has also 63 chemicals but if you get all the vaccines you get doses of 63 different types of chemicals some of which are known carcinogens some are known to cause asthma a summer that the list is endless mercury is mostly out of most of the vaccines but it's not out of all of them it's still in the multi dose flu shots that we start giving infants at six months of age and we give them every year and all the way through their life so are still getting doses of mercury there's tons of aluminum when I say tons I mean milligram amounts I mean that's of immeasurable amount so it's not tres little amounts and back when the whole thing about vaccines and mercury got started several years ago the mercury moms did a really great job of putting that on everybody's raised radar screen and we started talking an awful lot about the milligram amounts that these babies were getting they would get 88 milligrams of mercury injected into them if they got all doses of the mercury Laden vaccines and in the government oops somebody forgot to do the math and that's exactly what happened so back in 2004 when that was all going on the government didn't say to the pharmaceutical industry pull all those vaccines off the market and remake them they said as you make new ones replace the mercury so it just went out by attrition so all of those kids up through about 2006 we're still getting doses of mercury in each vaccine when the mercury thing became a really big deal I said yes it's a big deal but I felt a lot like the voice in the wilderness standing off to the side going it's not just the mercury because it's aluminum and chemicals and all these vaccine antigens all these viruses and bacteria stray viruses that are known to cause cancer in all kinds of gobbledygook inside of these things and I think that most parents and even most physicians who've never bothered to read a package insert in their life think that all that is in there is a little bit of sterile water a little bit of attenuated or killed virus that's it how can it hurt you and I could say I was a guilty of that it is the rest is the next person and I was the director of an emergency department for 12 years and I used to give out tetanus shots like I thought they were a special kind of candy little is good little more is not going to hurt you better to err on the side of getting at the not how wrong was I and once I started doing this investigation and I've spent more than 12,000 hours and 11 years of my life investigating this so anybody that has a question I'm your girl anybody who wants to debate me I'm your girl because there is nobody that is dedicated as much time in their life mostly uncompensated time to get the information out to protect our children and our adults we spend so much time talking about vaccines and children because of this heavily loaded vaccination schedule that happens up through five years of age but there are vaccine injured adults all over the place Ivan Ivan I have actually testified for several in federal court because they get the pneumonia shot they get flu shots they get hepatitis B the military gets about twenty six different kinds of vaccines and multiple doses of it and investigational vaccines so vaccine injured adults are a real are real too you"
1,so this chart shows the number of deaths reported to Tver this vaccine adverse event reporting season during each influenza flu season from 1990 onward and you see that there's hardly any zero reports than one report in 1993 to 94 and one in 1998 and these were after a flu vaccine given to a pregnant woman okay so that's what we're looking at we're looking at fetal deaths as in from women who had been pregnant and received the influenza vaccine so advance with these reports that's correct on it in the early years there was low vaccine coverage only mothers that were high risk were vaccinated and there are very low reports shown here when we get to 2009-2010 the coverage did increase but what happened was this was the pandemic year 2009-2010 so two influenza vaccines were administered to pregnant women sometimes at the same time there was the h1n1 pandemic flu vaccine and the seasonal a trivalent inactivated flu vaccine and so we have this huge spike in fetal deaths now what's interesting the CDC commissioned doctor Moro and others to do a study of influenza vaccine safety now you we see this spike here when dr. morrow was preparing a paper that he published he had access to this data but he cut off his study at the 2008/2009 and in his study the total number of fetal deaths over the 19 flu seasons was 23 deaths total and so it computed 21.9 fetal losses per 1 million vaccinated women and people saw the 2009 that his paper went from 1990 to 2009 appears in the title of the paper so many hot medical personnel physicians obstinance gynecologists thought he was including the pandemic year because the paper came in 2010 after the pandemic flu season but it stopped short of despite now there was a four x crease in distribution of the vaccine to pregnant women and so we would expect maybe a four times increase from the previous year to the next year but the increase was over four thousand person in reported cases so dr. morrow and his associates attributed this large increase to a webber like effect that's in effect when a new drug or vaccine is introduced to the market they expect over reporting and but we could show that the report to theirs were just elevated on fetal losses other adverse effects were not elevated so it could be proven that this effect here this spike was far greater than you could attribute to a new product coming to the market so you're saying that that spike was just during the h1n1 season and the other Vere's reports didn't come in in higher numbers from that vaccine just the maternal just so the fetal loss right other reports such as anaphylactic shock we used as a control only increased 10% and the what we explained was that this spike was due to an overdose of thimerosal because both the seasonal vaccine and the pandemic h1n1 vaccine could both contain thimerosal this mercury preservative well that's really scary they're pushing this vaccine on all pregnant women up and now it's a few other vaccines so that's very scary news yes now obviously the CDC noted that and so they subsequently in the next year removed the pandemic vaccine as a second vaccine and incorporated the h1n1 virus into the trivalent or seasonal vaccine so instead of three seasonal vaccines there were two seasonal strains and the h1n1 and that brought the rate back down interesting so they knew this happened clearly yes now also at about this time there was a big campaign that was to market flu vaccine so when Mauro came out with his paper in 2010 October showing the 19 previous flu seasons the media actually thought that the pandemic flu season was safe so it was advertised as completely safe
1,dr. Dan Papa I really became known for my cellular detox work which really came out of my own story so from pain to purpose is what I love to say and now I'm blessed to train doctors around the country to do what I do so then you've had quite a journey in your life that's led you to where you are today can you give us your background and kind of what brought you into your interest in being able to do detox and detox the body program things like vaccines yeah you know I mean it wasn't something that I sat down and thought here's a great career right I'm going to just do cellular detox work no it really came out of my own story as you said and I really was at the best shape of my life I mean honestly we just had two young boys life could have been better a thriving practice at the time and all of a sudden fatigue out of nowhere and I guess if it was just that it would have been simple but it went from fatigue to anxiety sleep problems you know couldn't get to sleep wake up no I couldn't get back sleep in debilitating anxiety even at that time and then I became allergic to everything I ate so like so many people I'm sure even watching this it was like this food it was that food and then I became chemically sensitive where I couldn't even leave my environment without getting sick so life as I knew it came to a screeching halt I mean Mike the hair got thin I mean I wasn't healing Norman I couldn't even adapt to even normal stresses like sound let alone a crying baby where my wife would have to take the child and go and it was my journals were shot my thyroid was shot but when I would address those things it seemed like some things would get better but other things not so well it would get worse so life as I know it change it seems somewhat inexplicable right like that's like where did this come from yeah no I I didn't know I mean at the time and I went from being very healthy I was in the best shape of my life and you know two young kids as I said and all of a sudden this comes out of nowhere years later after suffering for many years I realized the source which was mercury how did you finally figure out that you and mercury toxicity that was causing all that really strange symptoms in your body after some years of researching I mean when you can't sleep in the middle of the night you know you get some of your best work done and by the way it was like I was dyslexic as a child so I had this photographic very odd good memory that I developed through it I'm sure but you know that went to waste in my illness I started not being able to do that but at times it would come and I'd be able to learn and read research and I came across madhatters disease and I you know if you recall what that is but people making felt hats they used mercury to attenuate molds and other things that would happen in the felt and they became known as Mad Hatter's well that was me I literally read those symptoms I said I'm this person I'm mad as a hatter but that was acute mercury poisoning so I thought okay this is me I went down I got a blood test and came out negative I was devastated a year or so later I was I became friends with an endocrinologist bright guy and I knew my thyroid like said wasn't working well and body temperatures were so low and he said you know then I think you have mercury poisoning just based on your body temperatures the hormone destroy Galatian you have I said I thought so too I got tested I was negative he said what test did you do he said a blood test that was the wrong test that's good for acute mercury poisoning but not so good for chronic I think you have chronic poisoning what do you think I got he said you have any dental work done around the time that's happened and I thought I might because I had gold filling put in and they drilled out an amalgam filling I still had six by the way amalgam fillings 50% mercury in the filling and so I said well called my best friend who actually did the work got the date it was days after that that actually much symptoms started I just never put it together I thought it was the anesthetic who knows but that's when it started and then it just built from there and and no doubt I had been accumulating it through my lifetime through vaccinations my father slathered me and methylated in the nother source was a saline solution was the number one source it was actually thimerosal is put in the saline solution all the way through 70's 80's early 90's than it was outlawed well so the mercury poison that you experience you know which created all these debilitating things for you personally is this going on with people who are getting vaccinated and these and with vaccines that contain thimerosal so there's no doubt I mean I you know I said I got to experience what a damaged child on the autism spectrum would see except my brain was already developed but literally I mean that not dealing with sound you know the sensitivities that I developed just the inability even to look people in the eyes that shyness I found out later it's called mercurial ism where literally you just you lose this social ability I mean I didn't want to leave my home trust me murky ilysm I've never heard the half word yeah yeah and it's literally known as this odd that shyness or this you know I I was I wouldn't call myself an extrovert you know like what my wife um I definitely was more outgoing and I went from that to where like said I couldn't look people in the eye I didn't even want to have social interaction I was autistic in an adult body ah so that's kind of like you you felt that has that withdrawal kind of thing where you kind of don't want to be out and sounds and getting bother you excedrin now that you discovered this I guess in one sense it's like okay good at least there's an explanation for what I'm experienced yeah exactly I I just got goose bumps right now you know you just certain things in your story this brings you back but you know it through it my wife had said look God is not only going to help you and take you through this but he's going to take a message to the world through you and at that time that's why I got goose bumps because at that time I didn't see that you know I couldn't see that at that time it was I couldn't even I didn't want to live honestly I didn't and that was that bad I could imagine living life like that I would have rather tough and there was times believe me I thought that was an easy way and she would remind me of that and also I would get angry at her because I would think you know if you only knew what I felt like you know I get angry because of her hope that you have but that came to fruition I mean I through it I learned what I learned what I teach today it came out of that pain you know so my mantra has become from pain to purpose and so now what you have figured out is how to detox your body that has been poisoned with heavy metals you know that vaccines contain because you know we spend a lot of time in this program in vaccines revealed talking about the damage how the damage occurs mercury aluminum you know etc the combination of these things how the body responds to at different milestones and development along the way I mean all of these things have been discussed but really it's very critical because it might be one thing for people say wow glad I found out about this in time I'm not vaccinating my kid Ryan but what about you but the majority of people out there have been vaccinated and kids have been vaccinated and they're probably experiencing these fake systems like you're describing it's one thing when you have a very overt wow that's kind of immediate positive effect vaccine reaction but it's another thing with it's a little bit more insidious a little bit more subtle and then and then you start your people try to tell you you're crazy you know they think something psychologically wrong with you as compared to biologically wrong with you so in this case now I think it's critical that we talk about the fact that there's hope for people who have been damaged that they can somehow detox this these heavy metals or Triton these poisons or toxins out of their body so what what exactly happens kind of on the cellular cellular level and then what is the processes that you recommend so that people can improve themselves said a lot of amazing things that that I'm coming out of my skin because number one just because you don't get damaged at the vaccination does not mean you're not damaged right we take these kids okay they didn't end up on the autism spectrum but if we understand what's happening right now with autoimmune most of it is undiagnosed and most people have it it's some level in one autoimmune builds up on another this is the real epidemic these kids that are being vaccinated today and we can talk about there's some generational things that are happening right but we are having an explosion yes of autism related disorders by the way which is you know considered autoimmune but we're having all these children and people later that are developing autoimmune conditions we our generation didn't get nearly the vaccinations right but yet in the 30s in 40s and 50s we're seeing an explosion of autoimmune look they're toxic but they stimulate the wrong immune system they stimulate and activate a type ii reaction which is an emergency reaction so with every vaccine you're training the body to overreact into autoimmune not to mention then there are toxins you know that all of these things can turn on genes of autoimmune we all have them so we don't get the condition because you have the gene you get the condition because the gene is turned on so look at the bottom line is this you know that's a big thing that we have to understand is that people have conditions say that we never thought it was the bio accumulation of toxins and stressors to our lifetime to the vaccines the flu shots whatever it is that's one thing I have a pet peeve of detox and good okay because you know today I think people realize the need for the the detox and its invoke if you will but most people do it wrong so when I was getting my life back it was you know years of understanding and researching really what detox is to what I teach today it has to be a cellular detox you have to go up to the level of the cell to really that's where true detox is so I became known for what I call true cell of detox because that's what it is so I have nothing against colon cleanses there's a lot of different things a liver cleanse this 10-day cleanse them and they're all over the market but they're fine I have nothing against those detoxes but the point is is that they're downstream from with a real problem and that's the cell so real detox you have to get the cell doing what it does naturally so you're saying like the benefits of these organ detoxes but you're saying it's got to get down to a cellular level in order for to truly detox these these poisons are talking about versus when you look it was it was damaged on me when you look at what's damaged in an autistic child it's a cellular issue yes certain genes get turned on even because the cell itself is not able to get rid of the toxins that are now but you know accumulating in the cell turning on bad genes but when the cell membrane gets damaged mitochondria gets damaged these things are all needed in the normal process of a cell getting rid of toxins that's what you have to fix so I don't care how much of these herbals that you take things like karela you know they're actually weak binders anyway you have to get the cell doing what it should be doing that's real detox and that happens in three phases we do a preparatory phase where we prepare the downstream pathways like the gut the liver the kidneys and the cell and then we have to use what I call true binders to make sure the toxins once the cell starts actually up regulating its detox that we bring the toxins all the way out of the body that's real detox so we have a prep phase we have a body phase and we ultimately have a brain phase where we have to go deep enough with the sailordiy talks to where it matters I got my life back by detoxing my brain and that's the key that's what people are missing you know it's that deep level brain detox that really is how we're going to change and make a difference in all those conditions not just autism so basically the problem is when we say you know Gallo Lumina Mercury they have these adverse effects and it can lead to really devastating your health in your life moving forward but the key is saying okay if we're going to get happy but reverse that process to whatever degree at ten be reversed it's a matter that this stuff is in the cells it is and that's where I take out mercury does accumulate in the brain does so it's a matter saying hey we've got to get this stuff out of the body and use the term binder so it's a matter of having things that can get to the cell I'm so bind with the heavy metal and pry it out and take it out of the body and there's been some amazing breakthroughs in this and you know that we have some things that true binders and that's key because most of the herbals are not true binders they're not but they're able to cross into these membranes the cell membrane as well as the blood-brain barrier and actually be able to be a vehicle that doesn't let go of something like a heavy metal is very difficult to remove and make sure it moves all the way out of the body so when you put it in a system what I call true silly detox you know that's the magic I mean that's really how you get people's lives back you know and I have to you know I said that there's something happening today the need to get into the brain into that deeper tissue is key we were exposed we grew up in the mercury generation I mean I jokingly said My father slathered me in meth I laid which actually contain mercury right we look jerk remember no I heard the read right absolutely yeah that was that was mercury right there to cure chrome yeah absolutely mix Yoriko and then the contact lens fluids I mean thimerosal was in more than that I mean these are just some of you know the examples it's I Marisol has ethyl mercury that stuff goes right into the brain and I'm sure some of the your folks have talked about that but you know then the lead generation we grew up with lead gasoline yeah I mean it's like in the plane right yeah guess where most of them went in the bones of our parents guess what when mom is pregnant out comes the left during pregnancy it's natural lose bone but they lose lead and guess what it is going into the children right there's a study called the direst study where they looked at the number of fillings in moms mouth was proportional how much mercury they were finding on autopsies in baby's brain well I also got mom's brain mercury or moms amalgam mercury then the left so out of mom comes the lead into the baby that was our generation today there's a new problem glyphosate glyphosate is the ingredient in roundup and so many different herbicides today and pesticides so glyphosate according to studies Stephanie sent us I think you're interviewing her right yeah she was one of the first to show that glyphosate allows these neurotoxins to like mercury and lead to cross deeper into the brain so basically life assay which is almost ubiquitous now if you're not eating organic stuff if you have GMO foods right it's almost like saying it's opening the door saying come on in oh yeah yeah so the positive body doesn't it typically by trying to keep this stuff out but but you're saying that this you know this chemical that's sprayed you know you know all over the place absolutely is is something that invites in these toxins so it amplifies the effect absolutely it's breaking down the gut barrier so it's allowing more toxins across the gut remember the gut barrier is very similar to the blood-brain barrier it's opening that up and it's allowing these toxins to cross deeper not to mention it's creating disruption in the microbiome the good bacteria which is affecting detox hormones and neurotransmitters a three-prong destruction that's occurring I mean so much damage at the cellular level so we kind of have this perfect toxic storm in today's world today so it's and you could say any one of these things you have vaccinations could be just in and of itself of best thing but we take vaccines you take the moms amalgam you take yo look life a safe that's being ingested you start putting all these things together you're whipping up quite a cocktail here that that our genome has the reference point for it even try to adapt to it it's a perfect storm I mean you know those watching it's you know the perfect storm you had three storms come together and catastrophic storm occurs right that's what's happening so you know I think it's going to be very difficult ever to say vaccines is the cause of autism well look you know we could debate that to the cows come home but when we look what's happening we know that it's a part of it but these perfect storms are happening hepatitis B vaccine it has 200 times the amount of aluminum that they consider safe and they give a baby an IV so what's the difference you know what's the difference we rejecting it on IV so why is your standards one thing here and we're giving it two hundred times and more in a vaccination I mean so point is is this amount of neurotoxins with something that already in utero they're getting exposed to glyphosate you know we find it mother's breast milk opening up the blood-brain barrier allowing these neurotoxins to cross it when you look at a statistic that possibly if things remain the same by 2030 to one out of two kids are going to be on the autism spectrum it seems impossible until you explain this if you know this perfect storm that's happening that's the way the graph is charting right and that's the graph it's straight now I mean is that you know maybe it's going to hit better who knows but when you when I heard that statistic even myself said wait a minute that sounds good that sounds hard ibly but when you think about what's happening with the perfect storm with this generation you say I could see it I know you develop detox protocols that now there's hundreds of providers you know throughout the world that are incorporating but somebody who's watching this at home right now who said you know you know I've been back through my kids been vaccinated right I'm relating to what you're saying what types of actions can they take to try to remedy their situation you know one of the game changers for me if you understand when I started researching the cell membrane it's so many things happen you know the cell membrane is key you know I think burst lipped and really identified that life happens on the membrane to it you know I mean everything happens on the membrane the intelligence resides in this membrane anumita brain in the member is a brain in the membrane right I mean if you understand I don't want more people it's too much science but you know it's literally how our nerve system comes from a membrane right right and there lies the intelligence but that membrane allows the good stuff into the cell but it also when it's functioning properly allows the toxins to come out when that gets compromised I think most people watching is hurt inflammation is the cause of everything right I mean but we're talking about not inflammation of your sore shoulder but inflammation of every that membrane becomes inflamed now it doesn't function the way it should bad genes get turned on to turn them off we have to fix the membrane right first listen that's a lot of his work for it to detox if you don't fix that membrane the cell doesn't detox so I developed something called my five hours of how to fix a cell it became a road map that I teach practitioners on what to do to fix a cell our number two is regenerating that cell membrane fats are key everybody should be paying attention to fats when I started increasing fats in my diet even real butter breast fed butter arachidonic acid is a fat that I think most people would think that's a bad one right well we know it stabilizes the membrane so you take something like a rack tonic acid in many parents they're just loading up their child on fish oil in there forgetting about if you don't have enough arachidonic acid fish oil actually becomes dangerous so increasing some of these fats from grass-fed meats and actually butter can be really a game-changer today what we have happening in the autistic world and even the you know the general population that eats healthy they're taking fish oils and they're actually creating something called omega-3 dominant so imagine so we're doing a few things wrong here like everyone's taking probiotic the same bacteria creating dysbiosis everybody's taking fish oils thinking this is great creating something called omega-3 dominance so the point is is that increase your good fats don't be afraid of the saturated fats they help stabilize the membrane to cholesterol there's a fad that people fear I would think many times the practitioners give drugs to try to inhibit the production of it absolutely so these fats you know from real foods grass-fed foods grass-fed butters fantastic you know I'm not against you know fish oil but I like it in fish okay and if you get a fish oil be selective and we rotate those in we don't keep people on them you know because we're searching for certain ratios so our diet does play a role even putting people into ketosis is key we know ketones are by the way their product of Fatma have ilysm so as you break that down you make something called ketone they change the brain they can heal the brain that's what the science shows they can even turn off bad genes so changing people and getting their cells to burn fat as a majority energy source is called ketosis and that can also be a really here at healing property to the from this ketone so there's a couple things right there so if I'm a mom you know right now and I want to try to help my kids in this way one thing I can do is get butter from grass-fed cat actually meat from grass-fed cows and and get more natural sources of some of these things like fish oil as compared to having them extracted Absalom and and put that together that these can help heal and regenerate and now detox and don't forget I mean we like also we like coconut oil those medium chain fats olive oils and mono fats you know get over diet e olive oil okay lucky me there's over 100 you're damaging you may you take a bad or good fat and make it bad but you know adding these fats into the diet it sounds like a an obvious thing or a small thing but it really is key to fixing the membrane in fixing this brain all at the same time anything else that you that you would give advice to for Co somebody's watching saying you know just right in the household I can kind of do this which would help well I remove ensure that I have five hours our number one is remove the sources okay obviously remove the sources from the brain eat non-gmo food so you're not get into class eight but remove the sources from your life right look at the cleaning supplies that you're using it's so easy to do it natural these days I mean you know you can make your own for goodness sake but you know eating organic you know especially in things like grains if you're going to eat grains because they're sprayed with that glyphosate all the greens are sprayed unless you're a hundred percent grain by the way taking grains away is another good tip we goes a fast way to down regulate cell inflammation is to control glucose and insulin taking grains away actually can do that faster believe it or not even than sugar it just seems to take more of the inflammation out faster you should take sugars away to process sugar but grades of a big impact because there's a things in grains not just gluten that is leaking across a leaky gut that is driving inflammation and autoimmune well I think those are some some great advice and I'm sure people can search you know online about me of getting deeper into some of these things but you know like you said removing things that are facilitating you know the problems that you have and adding some things like you know healthy fats you know could could make a big difference in people's lives now I know that's its own personal I know that you actually even adopted kids into your home that were vaccine damaged and had to deal with that can you keep mad about the old story but yeah I said it's been pain to purpose and most doula tell your story but it goes beyond my story believe me my wife has led toxicity I don't even have time for that story but she was going to end up just like her mother with breast cancer and of dying in beuter in cancer because her hormones got disrupted from her high lead levels so that's one story but another story is we had a tragedy in our family merrily much my wife her cousin Lisa they were best friends and they had boy and a girl seven year old twins at the time and they tragically died and we ended up with the seven-year-old and we adopted them a whole nother story within that story of trauma but he was vaccine damaged and it we saw it happening before of Dillon yet Dillon so I mean you know even at his first vaccines she said there were certain reactions and in the next round it was worse and I I literally sat before the father and I had him convinced not to vaccinate again because this time I felt like it was going to send him over the edge and it did Asperger's sensory integration and that was around age four they really tipped and we ended up with the kids at age seven so what I was trying to get her to do to help detox him I ended up having to do so it wasn't long after I got my life back literally that I we ended up having the kids come in so here I am thinking I am I'm better all these great things then we get to kids now hold on we just had a brand new baby six weeks old well I went from two kids you know when I was six six week old baby life's good and then we got two more so I went from two kids to five and six weeks you know I and I wasn't completely well yet but you know it's amazing story really because I took what applied to me getting my life back to Dylan he was like my second patient and if you met Dylan today's 20 you would never know you would never know and I met yeah exactly so that's from pain to purpose you know it's interesting you know I heard you say one time that you a lot of times you'll see the immediate reactions of the vaccines and it over time as you know and in boys and girls it might be the reaction times might be somewhat different times over how do you see that yeah I said there's twins a boy and a girl yeah I wonder how many people caught that right yeah what happened to the girl yeah she seemed fine until she got to a teenager and then she started developing sensory integration she started developing the increase in pain appeared like fibromyalgia fatigue some other symptoms like even increase in smell and taste and all of a sudden life dropped out ironically enough I told you I was interviewing her on a TV show that I do and you know she told the story and even I was like oh gosh I forgot she started doing true silly detoxing getting an ally and now she told the story of how she came out of that but point is is that boys testosterone actually has an amplifying effect to these neurotoxins like mercury and aluminum and estrogen has a protective effect but again just like I said with autoimmune and other conditions you may think you dodged the bullet until later that's Olivia's story so how that hits home so people watching this just because you'd end up on the autism spectrum doesn't mean you're clear well any other there's one probably one other caveat is that if you think about what the typical process is let's say you have that you know that girl who was later that things started to show up that didn't seem to make you take them to a traditional allopathic physician who is going to say well we can start keeping these varying medications to try to you know mask these symptoms or try to make these symptoms more palatable and that's additional toxins coming in through the medications that's actually your perpetuator making things worse as compared to you know resolving it but nobody would ever canal vaccines from a long time ago from years ago to what's been able aryans today they would you know had you loved philosophy Olivia said something in the interview today she said you know before age 7 she took tons of antibiotics her and her brother right after age 7 they end up in our home she said I haven't taken an antibiotic since I've had strep throat I've had earaches and I thought yeah that's a great point you know my biological children have never taken antibiotic ever you know they have never taken a drug and nor she in Dillon since they got in my house so what changed the philosophy that's right we live our life from a different philosophy right she lived her life from a different phosphate just when she said it I got goose bumps man Imperia I'd be chosen it's like that's it the philosophy changed our world had changed her world you know she's not going to end up in the autoimmune but she would have for the reason you said well the philosophical note I think we can leave it at that thanks so much for the work you do and thanks for sharing your wisdom with us I'm still early you're welcome
1,"- I can't think of any issue in the world more important than the issue that we are speaking about today. And that says a lot, because there's a lot
 of issues in the world. But our children are sick. They are being robbed
 of healthy childhoods, free of medication, disease, illness, and they are dying. And one of the worst parts
 about that statement, is that parents are
 unknowingly buying products, and medications that are
 causing this to happen, but they are uninformed and
 they are not aware of the risks. And when we walk into the doctor's office and we walk into the grocery store, we are being lied to on such
 a deep and disturbing level. And this issue keeps me up at night, and it's what jolts me
 out of bed in the morning, to speak out and to be brave, because our children deserve better. (applause) Thank you. So right now, you guys,
 we are at a pivotal time in our history, one which can no longer be ignored, minimized or manipulated. We have the sickest generation of children ever recorded in history. This is the first generation of children that will not outlive their parents. Raise your hand if you are okay with that. I am not. And all three of my
 beautiful healthy children lost their right to go to
 public and private school last year, in the state of California, that I have paid taxes
 in for my whole life, I've lived here, so it's time that we start to
 ask really tough questions. Because you know what, the junk food industry
 spends $100 million a year marketing their toxic,
 cancer-causing food substances to your children, and the
 pharmaceutical industry has spent billions of dollars brainwashing the American public and
 the medical establishment that the only way we as parents
 can protect our children from disease, is by
 injecting aborted human DNA, animal DNA, and some of
 the most toxic chemicals known to the human race
 into our growing babies, such as formaldehyde,
 aluminum, polysorbate 80, glyphosate, which is Monsanto's Round-Up, monkey kidney cells, I could
 go on, but you all know this. And we're supposed to accept that. We have accepted it, as a universal truth, no questions asked. And when we do ask
 questions, what happens? We're called crazy, bad parents, anti-vaccers, and lunatics. And what's really interesting
 is the word lunatic, a hundred years ago, it meant someone who was crazy enough to think that we could travel to the moon. And today, we're seeing history
 repeat itself, aren't we? We're seeing the hate and the
 booing and the discrimination and children getting kicked out of schools and doctor's offices,
 perfectly healthy kids, being blamed for spreading diseases that they don't have in
 their body, it's impossible. And most of society has
 accepted it as a truth. So today we have to rise up, and we have to take the
 power back as parents, and we have to ask the tough questions. No matter what labels or
 discrimination is placed on us, we have to ask the question, where is the study that shows the current CDC-recommended schedule for
 infants and children is safe? No where, it doesn't exist. Where are the double-blind
 placebo safety studies for vaccines, where are they? No where. They've never been done. How do we know that injecting
 human DNA and animal DNA at the same time into a
 developing immune system is safe? And the answer to that is we don't, because it's never been tested. Why is it that 98 percent of Americans have said they want to
 know what they're eating, yet time and again, GMO
 legislation, labeling laws, gets dismantled? How come, in the state of California, glyphosate is now labeled
 as a known carcinogen, a cancer-causing substance by our state, and by the World Health Organization, yet it is mandated to be
 injected into children in the form of vaccination
 every single day, before they can go to school? Why are we allowing this, you guys? We have to take the power back. Parents have the power, we always have, but we forgot that we did. So I ask you to stand for all
 of the children who have died, all of the children
 that have been destroyed and mutilated by this atrocious industry, all of the families who
 have lost everything, who have been financially devastated, because of the profits
 that these industries make. And all of the children
 that are currently sick and those that will become
 sick if we don't stop this. I ask you to stand, not just today, because
 it's really easy to be brave in a room full of people, a group of people that
 think the same way you do, but it's not so easy to be brave when you're being
 silenced by everyone else. We have been silenced by our media, by the government, by the
 pharmaceutical industry, by our doctors and
 we've even been silenced by some of our friends
 and family, haven't we? But today we are saying no more, not in our state, not in our country, not with our children, we
 have to take the power back. (shouts and applause) so I ask you guys to stand with me, and for all the children of this world, not as the crazies and the
 weirdos or the lunatics, but as the revolutionaries. The warriors and the
 rebels who are standing up and saying no more, you may not experiment on
 our children any longer. So join me, let's be as loud and clear as we can with our intention. I want Dr. Pan in Sacramento to hear us, I want Merck and Monsanto
 and every corrupt politician in Washington to hear us as we chant, parents have the power. Join me everybody. Parents have the power! Parents have the power! One more time, parents have the power! Let me hear you, parents have the power! Parents have the power! Thank you very much, God bless. Thank you for being here."
1,"welcome to true out Tuesday and the truth will set you free okay today vaccine Court has anyone in here ever heard a vaccine Court okay well you've been told by every media personality and by virtually every doctor with cultural authority that vaccines are safe and effective they present and prevented a number of different diseases roll up your sleeves and get shot and if you're not getting vaccinated then your evil person and you're infecting others around you because of herd immunity have you heard of this well why what what started this okay what started this frenzy because when I was growing up you get him you could not get him it doesn't really matter where here's a couple of books that I'd recommend you reading how to end the autism epidemic and vaccine peer review now there's over a thousand peer-reviewed articles in the vaccine peer review over a thousand okay of vaccines doing harm so why are we even talking about this well this is interesting now I know the prints ridiculously small but I did a vlog okay and that's that's using your cell phone and just talking in there and I I try and do about one a day and I just went on the CDC website that's the Center for Disease Control this isn't satan-worshipping calm okay this is the CDC and you go in there to the vaccine adverse event reporting system and I show how you would go in there and click on this to get data from the US federal government and all I did was click in death vaccine vaccine type age and sex that's it hit the button and over four thousand kids that have died from this now we know that the vaccine adverse event reporting system court in Health and Human Services between one and ten percent of the actual incidences and I thought that this would be a value because most people don't actually look into this and you're not taught by this by the media because the media is a controlled group okay you're not going to see independent news reporting just talked to Cheryl Atkinson okay we're talking Emmy award-winning Edward Armour award-winning and she mentioned a couple of things on vaccines and they had to kick her out because of finances I just wanted to show you so I just described me going on to the CDC site and typing in the information okay here's one of the comments bastard evil hell spawn Pro belongs in prison then sent back to Hell where he came from I could show you one of the more nasty ones but I just thought okay so this is the psychosis out there okay so what the quality of your life really depends on the quality of questions you ask okay I am NOT auntie VAX I am NOT anti antibiotic if you have a viral infection and an antibiotic is not good for you okay if you have a disease that can be prevented without any negative effects a vaccine would be totally appropriate to say everybody on the planet means 72 doses of 17 different vaccines I don't agree with that unless I see a study so what happened first I asked these questions before you look into this is our population the healthiest population you've ever seen on the planet okay well we got 54% of our kids with a chronic illness or disease so it's not working why has the number of vaccines tripled since the liability protection laws were passed in 86 now we're going to go into this because this is a talk about the vaccine court it's just in 1986 when if you got a flu shot you could actually sue the company or you got a DTP you could sue the company if it was manufactured incorrectly or you got a negative reaction in 86 they took away that law so now ask I'm answered me this in 86 when the companies were liable there were 23 vet doses of seven vaccines ten years later they're 33 doses of 9-valent 2016 69 doses of 16 different vaccines and now 72 doses of 17 different vaccines and the health of the population isn't improving or not I mean it's it's a very simple question because if we're forcing this on the public it might be nice to ask those okay now why are chronic disease rampant knowing that this alters the immune system I'm gonna give you enough data in here to show that vaccines can be dangerous that's it that's it freak out later I'm just telling you data okay why are Vick vaccine exemptions and choice being taken away in the 60s we would go to love-ins where they had military personnel around okay they just a massacred a few people at Kent State and we were trying to protest a war now I was only like nine ten years old but I was there with my older sisters and I thought it was cool good rock music but you saw the people with guns and they were protesting a war that was ten thousand miles away do you think that group would submit to forced medical procedures without the informed consent I don't think so I don't think so okay but then again if it is safe and effective and it's been proven safe and effective and if every doctor recommends it and if you don't get it you're gonna infect others then why not take everyone's rights away you know it's for the greater good okay if you lose a couple of kids at least you're gonna save the general population if that is in the data okay and is the media reporting on vaccine damage well let's look at the facts we have one of the lowest infectious disease rates in the world in this country we do we have one of the highest vaccination actually the vaccination rate of any other country typically double or triple of any other country okay why because we have great health care however America is the worst infant mortality of any industrialized country that means six kids die for every thousand before their first birthday and we also have one of the highest maternal mortality rates so so where is this disconnect well first let's look at informed consent we know that that the Nazis during the Nuremberg trials they got in trouble not for experimenting on people okay but experimenting on people without their informed consent and then also they said there was they coerced them into getting the experiments and there wasn't a really properly formulated scientific experiment and and that's typically considered a randomized control trial where you take a group of people don't do anything to them take a group of people give a placebo anyone know what a placebo is okay an innocuous substance that doesn't have an effect on the body okay that's not done in in the vaccine trials they do it against a group of vaccine that's already been tested okay and then you take a group and you do an actual therapy so now there's no informed consent as of 2010 I mean if you're working at a hospital you got to either wear a yellow badge yes it shape of a star okay gosh some people are just familiar with history but it says I have not been vaccinated or I am contagious okay yes really honest to god okay coercion for work and education no liability for the manufacturing no fault in this couldn't be do you think that that's possible well let's get into it so what form this what form this vaccine Court well let's take you back to the 70s okay that was like yesterday for me but when we look at it Griffin vers United States they found out that one of the batches the polio vaccine wasn't made correctly and it caused harm and then we look at it pertussis diphtheria tetanus poliomyelitis in 6660 87479 all of these had a number of life-threatening damages and in some lives were lost because the product was so dangerous now this was a challenge because the in the vaccine industry in the 60s and 70s was about six billion dollars a year there were twenty four companies producing these vaccines however because all of these people were getting damaged the vaccine companies started to go out of business I mean they had about thirty billion dollars worth of lawsuits and they were only making six billion a year so so this was was a challenge now they were saying sudden infant death mental retardation other conditions and it was crazy so the the shots went from seventeen cents to eleven bucks a shot okay to help pay for some of the lawsuits so then the government has to step in okay and it's the House Committee on Energy and Commerce is this that the health and safety no this is the Energy and Commerce they're there to protect the business okay so the what they did is they had to find some type of of other compensation okay program now you might think damn wouldn't shouldn't we make a safer product and protect the public it's silly people that's pretty funny no it's protecting the business this is commerce for God's sake okay so the Congress passed the Act to compensate the victims without harming the industry so for each vaccine a seventy-five cents goes to this giant fund now the National childhood vaccine injury Act and this was it was because it's reduced the potential financial liability of the vaccine matric maker due to vaccine injury claims now do you see anywhere in there to make a safer product okay good just checking can you imagine the comments I'm gonna get on this how dare you put that stuff that was in in nineteen eighties dude here it is okay under the National Vaccine injury compensation program is can created a no-fault system for vaccine related injuries or death okay in there go to special masters now again I'm sorry about the small print but this is what I took off of the site this is actually the part of the Act that I got a pretty big challenge with because I mean if you're gonna give somebody a liability free product of course in 86 it wasn't forced on the public okay now it is you know 30 years hence so back in 86 at least you could option religious or personal beliefs or just say look I don't think it's good okay but they had a mandate for safer childhood vaccines and this is - I'm just gonna read the part one promote the development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions than those vaccines on the market December 22nd 1987 and promote the refinement as such vaccines so this goes on to state that Health and Human Services okay within two years after December 22nd 1987 and periodically thereafter the secretary shall prepare and transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of that of the House of Representatives and the committee of Labor and Human Resources a report describing the actions taken pursuant to the subsection a of the section during the two-year previous so what they're gonna do they're going to look at the damage that was done look at the lot numbers the vaccines the type of people to compile a report and present it to Congress so there would be an oversight makes sense right okay now it was 30 years ago there hasn't been one report okay not one report okay so when Congress granted and I love that little this quote here because you're gonna see a lawsuit was filed when Congress granted economic immunity to pharmaceutical companies in 86 Congress recognized that as visser ated the economic incentive for pharmaceutical companies to create a safer vaccine or make existing one safer they realized that they said look man we're giving these guys a free range on a product that they have no liability for so we have to have an oversight health and suman's Human Services has never not even once submitted a bio-neural report to Congress never not even once it heightens the concern that Health and Human Services doesn't have clue to the actual safety profile of the now twenty-nine doses and growing vaccines given here a year twenty-nine vaccines this is by the first year it's actually 36 now oh and by the way I handed out of liar this is 10 years old and you'll notice it says autism is one in a hundred and fifty and not anymore okay it's about one in twenty eight depending on the data you're looking at okay so now this guy okay is a warrior he went in and bought around 7,000 copies of how to end the autistic epidemic and gave it to every member of Congress okay so this is a guy who also filed the lawsuit and that's part of the lawsuit with Health and Human Services to say guys I read the Act where's all the reports of the safety studies and they said are bad we didn't do any okay so the vaccine adverse event reporting a system which is what the entire system is designed to see because if you're giving free range and you're getting 23 doses of seven vaccines you're going to maybe end up with a negative result okay so they have to have this reporting system now the Institute of Medicine established existing literature on vaccine adverse events occurring after 'men immunizations regardless of whether there was a direct link between the events so now this is what was supposed to again this is in law now it was passed in 86 so you're gonna have to really break your mind open when we talk about forced vaccination to get school force vaccination to get a job okay if you have a childcare you have to force vaccinate all the kids and all your employees okay so just what you have to do on them and the Tver website you have to provide a written benefit and risk information before the vaccination takes place here's the benefit of a flu shot you may not get a flu of course if you're over 65 there's zero benefit and if you're under two there's zero benefit okay flu shots are 40% of all the vaccines used and there's 60 percent of all the adverse events okay you can get paralysis you can get DM Perret you can get a number of different events okay but now that you've read that I have complied with part one so do you think that there the vaccine adverse event reporting system do you think they're complying with this or do you think they're not in compliance with the letter of the law because it would sound really stupid well gee doc I'm looking at the risk and benefits here and I don't agree with it I would much rather get the flu okay sorry permanent records got to be kept a record of all the serious health problems and you have to make a report to the vaccine adverse event reporting system now it's estimated that only one and ten percent of all vaccine adverse events are reported to the system one to ten percent so you can multiply every number that I give you from now on by ten okay this was in 2011 this was the nail in the coffin okay this is when the Supreme Court actually had to look at the National childhood competent vaccine injury compensation program two hours after Hannah Bruesewitz received her six-month EPT shot she started having seizures was Hospital continued to suffer from seizures and it says it on the label that it can cause it okay now it took them a while to file okay one month prior to the petition new regulations eliminated her seizure disorder from the compensable injuries I'm going to show you the charts because if you have a certain condition they will cover that okay if it's in a certain time frame so they just removed the seizures in that time frame from now three years later in 1998 the drug company Wyeth withdrew the type of vaccine that was used in in this girl so it caused a problem they took the vaccine off the market nobody got any liability but this thing went before the Supreme Court and they said the court affirms the law that meant vac manufacturers are not liable for vaccine induced injury or death if they're accompanied by proper directions and warnings now this was the Supreme Court ruling on it two of the judges dissented and they just at Soda Meyer and just Justice Ginsburg this misconstrues the axe legislative history and disturbs the careful balance Congress struck between compensating vaccine injury children and stabilizing the childhood vaccine market its decision leaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately take account of scientific and technological advancements when designing to store distributing their product because nothing in the text structure or legislative history of the vaccine act remotely suggests that Congress intended such a result so they're saying this doesn't make sense there's nothing in the legislature so when you go to the justices Supreme Court and you see this this is part of their ruling no vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after 1988 if the injury death resulted from the side effects which were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly in accompanied by proper warnings so they Supreme Court says that vaccines are unavoidably unsafe the US Supreme Court says vaccines are unavoidably unsafe they those products in which the present state of human skill and knowledge cannot be made safe does anybody think that the one vaccine that they took off with Diana Baur sure wits that all the other ones are okay so when you hear the sound bites with the lack of data from all the media talking heads vaccines are safe and effective get your vaccine get your flu shot and I hear the Supreme Court saying they're unavoidably unsafe anyone have a problem with that okay so let's look at it and this is the group of people that is really behind this act and I can see when the pediatricians are but I gotta tell you there's a lot of brilliant pediatricians out there that are not following the schedule there they're choosing better vaccine schedules they're allowing the kids the immune system to develop they're not shooting live viruses vaccines in them until they get five or six years old I mean so they're they're actually being real doctors now when you look at the and this is just one fiscal report okay and this is to all the claimants that are filing a petition just from October 2015 to September 2016 so one year there were 887 vaccine petitions so that you got a child that had a vaccine you petition the government you go in there and say yeah they developed yi unbury yes you had a kid developed seizures now they have epileptic seizures your kid back there had type 1 diabetes all of these are listed on the vaccine sheet too by the way okay so you're one of the 887 petitions now if these petitions went through in that one year the payouts would have been nearly one trillion dollars one trillion dollars now luckily in in order to do that they or to avoid this they put in a bunch of restrictions to where you couldn't file for a certain problem in a certain time frame but what we're seeing here they did pay out about a billion dollars that year and petitions have increased about 40% again that was a few years ago so the vaccine payouts 2014 there were 22 million in 2050 and 114 million I don't have the stats for 2017 or 2016 but can you guess that they're probably increasing okay chickenpox went from zero to six million hepatitis B went from 1.9 million to 8 million tetanus four million HPV so these are payouts of people that had been damaged so can you hear that sound bite vaccines are safe and effective that's in a safe and effective except when they're not and they're forced on you okay so this schedule that was 23 doses of seven vaccines and I even said I said great guys okay you're Pro vaccine that's totally cool you can choose your own healthcare I think that's appropriate okay so let's go back to 1987 where you could actually choose to have you know of EXO a medical procedure and then this way we get the old rate of about one and twenty five hundred autistic kids and the health of the population improves and I got a little personal beliefs exemption that I could sign off on I'm totally cool with that but why why is the number of vaccines increase so exponentially is it just for the profit margin okay now we're looking at the CDC's rates of autism how it went from a hundred and fifty to announced one in 36 some people have it one in twenty two the cost for vaccines went from eighty dollars and eighty six to three thousand dollars okay in 2016 so let's look at vaccines are considered biologics oh and by the way has anyone seen the vaccine commercials okay you know dad why didn't you let me know you know this this cause genital warts and I could have got the HPV vaccine when I was a kid there's no disclaimer on the back of that do you know why because it's a public service announcement okay if they tell you about a Tylenol or Advil or you know it's some you know neat thing that will make you run through fields but it cause bleeding out of your eyeballs there's about ten minutes of discussion of the effects of it you know it doesn't matter that's the HPV shot is now I mean outlawed in some countries there's a number of lawsuits with it but they don't say that in those commercials so let's say you go to the Food and Drug Administration again government site government site okay I didn't make this up you go to biologic recalls and so what do we have here we have the meningococcal vaccine the diphtheria vaccine that was recalled we've got the quad rail and flu vaccine was recalled the hepatitis B vaccine was recalled the Gardasil was recalled but again these are just lot numbers they're just lot numbers they so were they were they were put out there some people got injected with it they might have found a problem with it and they voluntarily took it off the market but the people that were injured by this do they have any compensation well they have to go to the vaccine adverse event reporting system and file with a special master so let's look at other from peer-reviewed journal articles now what you'll hear with a lot of buttheads I mean people that that don't really look at the science they'll say there's one guy that said that vaccines cause autism okay that guy is dr. Andrew Wakefield I encourage you to actually read his book callous disregard that's the very first one he never mentions that vaccine can cause autism he does say that he found the measles virus inside of the gut of autistic kids and he felt that the gut damage was contributing to the brain damage and he suggested further study so there was never any fraud there but when people say yeah he got lost his license and and it was fraud okay that's not true you have to read the book okay so let's look at some of this pase Environmental Law Review 2011 unanswered questions a review of compensated cases of vaccine injured brain injury remember what do you hear that sound bite vaccines are safe and effective that scenes are safe and effective unless you are able to read okay peer-reviewed journal they've had 83 cases of vaccine caused brain damage and then you go through to read this it's like vaccine injury compensation has been compensating cases of vaccine induced brain damage associated with autism for more than twenty years go on stay with me Wow this is a peer-reviewed journal why isn't it on Channel four holy moly twenty years they've been paying out for vaccine brain damage okay my group okay anybody got the polio vaccine back in their early 60s yeah I mean 1960s okay I was eighteen sixty I know that was just smallpox okay yeah yeah so so when you look at this you think well wait a second okay this was nineteen fifty five to sixty one turns out that that polio vaccine that we got increases your risk of cancer it just took like 30 years to find it out okay I don't know what 69 dose this is 17 different VAX or 72 doses of 17 different vaccines is gonna do to the population in 30 years we know it's causing primary ovarian failure that's the hepatitis B vaccine we know that it's causing a lot of autoimmune conditions but I really don't know what the health of our population is going to be like in 30 years my population that got this one shows an increase of osteogenic sarcoma z' other bone tumors mesothelioma s-- and this dat these data suggest that there may be an increased incidence of certain cancers among 98 million persons who exposed to the contaminated polio vaccine in the u.s. further investigations are clearly justified okay when you go to the CDC site you actually get a thing that you have to that you can read you can pull it up and it'll say things like should you get vaccinated what are the risks of the disease what are the risk of the injury the standard schedule and this is for the measles mumps and rubella and you're supposed to actually get this from your doctor read it and then you decide you decide yes I want the vaccine I think the risks of seizures caused by fever and one out of thousand I think peppery pain and stiffness one out of four low platelet count and bleeding disorders I think that's okay severe allergic reaction is okay deafness long-term seizure calm a lowered consciousness and permanent brain damage is absolutely appropriate I just don't want the kid to have measles because I saw that Brady Bunch episode and that was really freaking bad okay okay and then what the doctors gonna say is I'm sorry your child cannot go to school oh oh you wanted a job as a nurse I'm sorry you can't do that either you read this you were forced to get it anybody got a problem with that okay DPT vaccine one in a thousand of non stop crying okay non describes crying seizures and remember this is not the same deep DTP shot that was causing all of those injuries they're going to bring that one back this one just hems to not really help with pertussis as much as the poisonous one that was causing all the damage but yeah now the health of our population we do have the highest vaccinated kid rate in the world okay by double and we have the lowest infectious disease rates but there are benefits to certain infectious disease rates that we're not going to talk about okay the benefits to getting measles benefits to getting chickenpox we're not going to go into that here but maternal mortality when you I started to see these these stats women are dying mothers are dying in this country and at a greater rate of any other industrialized nation now a maternal amount a lead rate more than doubled between 1990 and 2013 they're suggesting and I've got some dad here and you'll see all the references for anyone that's actually interested in reading women having babies in the US are vaccinated with influenza diphtheria pertussis and tetanus during the pregnancy now there's no Studies on even pregnant animals no long-term studies on the health of the kid and a long-term studies on n of this 2015 half the nation's pregnant women nearly 2 million women were either vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy or influenza now this is the vaccine schedule up to 2011 and you'll see that most countries ok before the age of five they're not doing a lot of vaccines they're allowing the kids immune system to develop this is what the gut of two vaccine injured kids yes they actually went through the vaccine court it took them nine years nine years to have it proved in court so when somebody says oh the one doctor was disproven that we're talking over 20 years they've been paying out compensation for this okay now this is the schedule so let's say you go through you get a vaccine you call up and you have damage you call it the vaccine adverse event reporting system this is the schedule you have to look at to see if your vaccine qualifies for an injury okay or your your injury with the vaccine qualifies in time now I put 2016 up here because 2016 when we're looking at the tetanus containing toxoid they had a B and C and the C there was complications including death disability injury okay within the prescribed prime period they just put not applicable so if you died from it it's not really an issue because it can't possibly be compensated for okay but if we look at the 2018 anaphylaxis within equal to or less than four hours so if you had an anaphylactic shock at five hours I'm sorry you don't qualify okay break your neuritis to 228 days if it's day 29 sorry if it happened on day one sorry you don't qualify Oh so then we look at this syncope okay vasovagal syncope you pass out okay in less than an hour that's okay if it happens at five or six hours that's not okay encephalitis and cephalopoda this is brain swelling brain swelling if it happens within the first 72 hours you're okay no I'm sorry our 73 you don't qualify Wow I mean what do you say to this it just doesn't make any sense and I put a few of these up there just so that you can see cuz not many people go to the varascite and find out what injury is cotton is okay and here's a good one when I did this talk before the rotavirus pneumococcal hepatitis a trivalent influenza there was no condition that they were gonna cover nothing nothing so you could have got the Gion beret and everything that the manufacturer says can cause but there is nothing that you could do well they added it in in 2018 and again it's pretty similar we're less than 48 hours less than one hour less than four hours seven to 42 days if they determine that's right strain do you see the challenge here and again these are forced so let's see what is the World Health Organization on say how to build a vaccine okay and this I just want to read a little bit of this because if you're thinking like the talking heads on the television ah vaccine it's pretty innocuous you got a little bit of the killed virus and you know a little bit of an adjuvant in there to stimulate the immune system response it's pretty innocuous okay let's find out different strands of Bordetella Bordetella pertussis have been purified by different methods for these reasons the protective efficacy in humans of various manufacturers products may be based on different mechanism which complicates the direct comparison the protective activity of various products and new formulations by means of simple laboratory tests indeed no unequivocal immunological correlates of protection against pertussis have yet been demonstrated nor has a generally accepted animal bottle to predict clinical FSC efficacy has been validated in English what I just said was we don't have any laboratory tests to see if this is efficacious like like if it's a good idea to give to somebody where the good outweighs the bad and they say nor has a generally accepted animal model to predict clinical efficacy has been validated okay now this is a product made by multiple manufacturers that's forced on the public and they can't even figure out a good test to find out if it's appropriate for you so let's look at the growth medium now viruses don't grow on their own they're well organized molecular parasites human fetal cells is just one of the growth mediums it could be bro vine albumin could be chicken eggs could be monkey kidney tissue could be caterpillar larva there's there's a lot of different growth mediums out there let's just look at the aborted human fetal cells these cultures are made for rubella hepatitis A rabies chickenpox vaccine now it's interesting when you look at the Journal of public health and epidemiology they're saying that universally introduced environmental factors fetal and retroviral contaminants and childhood vaccines that means that they're using the fetal aborted human fetal cells to grow the vaccines they're seeing a rise in damage of the brains it turned out injecting pieces of human into another human can have a negative response now again children vaccinated with the MMR varicella and hepatitis A vaccine there's a co introduction of vaccines manufacturing human fetal cells okay and again this is a journal article I'm not actually using this stuff in injecting and actually they're forcing injecting in there thus the rise of autistic disorder prevalence is directly related to the vaccines utilizing human fetal cells now if the Health and Human Services was actually doing their D job and they would see this they would say Wow let's see if we can get another growth medium perhaps using aborted human fetal cells isn't the best choice particularly when you look at the rise of autism in USA the United Kingdom Denmark in Western Australia three four totally different parts of the world four totally different demographics all with the similar rise in disease autoimmunity genetic immunologic triggers our portent triggers infections it turns out that the vaccines such as measles mumps and rubella have been so associated with autoimmune disorders hepatitis B vaccine associated with multiple sclerosis that's right the hepatitis B vaccine has shown to cause an increase rate of multiple sclerosis and there's there's a number of different diseases that these things can cause now the rotavirus okay this is for diarrhea most kids actually get it and get over it very very quickly it's a challenge in areas that have poor sewage treatments but is there better ways to take care of it well this shows that when they were doing Studies on it a few hundred kids ended up dying but Kaiser Permanente found out that they among the children who received it the pr"
1,"One of the things that
 has always interested me and was sort of central focus of research of my group when I was at
 the Royal Free Hospital was patent of exposure to infection. Now what do I mean by that? I believe that vaccines cause
 autism, but clearly, a lot of children get vaccinated
 and only some develop autism. Why some and not others? And this comes down, I believe, in large part to the patent of exposure. What do I mean by that? I mean age of exposure. And this is something that was born out by William Thompson's study from the CDC. Younger age of exposure
 producing a greater risk. Another patent of exposure
 which is is extremely important is the root of exposure, the root by which you are exposed to the infection. Now, take a disease like
 measles or indeed mumps or rubella or chicken pox. These were respiratory pathogens that we would inhale, they
 would go through our nasal and oral passages through the lungs and the natural way in
 which the immune system had been set up to deal
 with these infections was there, resident in the
 lining of the respiratory tract and was a system of immune cells that took up the virus,
 that processed the virus in a particular way, presented it to the immune system in a particular way that then invoked the beginnings
 of a protective response, clearance of the virus, and
 recovery from the infection. Now what happened with vaccination is we completely changed all that. So in a heartbeat, we changed
 the patent of exposure, the root of exposure from
 something that nature had set up over a very long period to
 injecting it subcutaneously. The immune system had
 never seen it in that way and in many cases, it's not surprising that it just put up its hands
 and said, ""I don't get this."" To develop a healthy immune response to any environmental pathogen,
 to an infectious agent, what we need is a
 balanced immune response. Broadly two elements to it,
 the antibody producing side of the immune system, what's called a T helper cell type 2 response, and the ability of the
 cellular immune system to identify virally infected cells and to seek them out and destroy them and that is predominantly a T
 helper cell type 1 response. What we need to be healthy is
 a balance between TH2 and TH1. Now when we change the dose or the age or the root of exposure, then potentially and in the real world
 we alter that balance and when you give
 certain infectious agents or their products subcutaneously,
 you produce a bias towards this proalogic antibody response. Now we measure antibodies
 as a measure of immunity, but they're not a good measure of immunity because they tell us nothing about the T helper cell type 1
 response and the ability to kill intercellular
 infections like viruses. Indeed, the greater the antibody response, the greater the T helper
 cell type 2 response, then reciprocally the
 lower the TH1 response. So actually more is not necessarily good. It's telling us that there is
 an imbalance in the system. So merely looking at antibodies and saying this is protection
 against the disease is a very, very simplistic
 and potentially hazardous way of viewing the system. So when you change the patent of exposure, when you change the
 root, the dose, the age, or indeed give concurrent
 infections at the same time in polyvalent vaccines,
 then you have the ability, the potential to profoundly
 alter this balance and the way the immune system is set up and create a potential hazard. The other thing to take into
 consideration when thinking about this issue of immune
 balance and imbalance is what else is in the vaccines? Not the live viral
 vaccines, but for example in the DPT and the Hib vaccine, DTA, thimerosal, it's a preservative, mercury is not a good preservative but a preservative that was
 in there, grandfathered in, highly toxic and in for
 a very, very long time until it was removed from most vaccines, although it's still present
 in trace amounts in many, but still in the majority of flu vaccines used in this country,
 should never be included in any vaccine whatsoever,
 why was it there extensively as a preservative? It's not a very good
 preservative, but I believe it was also there because
 it is an adjuvant. It acts as an adjuvant to stimulate, to boost the T helper cell type 2 immunity to boost the immune response and to give more antibodies but as we've already said, more is not necessarily a good thing. So apart from the sort of
 pervasive toxic effects of mercury on both the
 immune system and the brain and indeed upon many, many
 other cellular systems, it has the ability to
 increase, to act as an adjuvant and increase this antibody response. Then you add in something like aluminum, which is specifically in there to boost the antibody response and you've really got a toxic soup. You're driving the
 immune system inexorably towards this pro-inflammatory,
 T helper cell type 2 response in a way that may not
 allow the immune system to switch off, which I believe is why we're seeing so many
 immunological problems arising in children that
 we never saw before, this ongoing immune drive
 that has contributed to, I believe in large part, by metals that we find very difficult to get rid of from the body that persist and
 can cause long-term hazards. So when you take viral infections like measles, mumps, rubella,
 and you're giving a child at the same time a slew of vaccines that bias the immune response by virtue of containing mercury and aluminum towards this excessive antibody response, pro-inflammatory response,
 then it's little wonder that the immune system
 in many, many children abreacts to those viruses
 and produces complications. More is not better and
 there is a tendency now, a very strong drive,
 in fact, to incorporate more and more and more vaccines into the same shot or to
 be given at the same time in the absence of any
 safety studies whatsoever. It is convenient and that is unacceptable. You wouldn't do it with
 pharmaceutical products and you shouldn't be
 doing it with vaccines but that is the way the world's going. They're now talking, I think, at MIT about combining all of
 the childhood vaccine into a single shot and I have
 grave concerns about that."
1,have you ever wondered what's really in vaccines according to the US Centers for Disease Control all the following ingredients are routinely used as vaccine additives aluminum a light metal that causes dementia and Alzheimer's disease you should never inject yourself with aluminum antibiotics chemicals that promote superbugs which are deadly antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria that are killing tens of thousands of Americans every year formaldehyde a pickling chemical used to preserve cadavers it's highly toxic to the nervous system causing blindness brain damage and seizures monosodium glutamate MSG a neurotoxic chemical called an excitotoxin it causes brain neurons to be overexcited to the point of death MSG is toxic even when consumed in foods where it causes migraine headaches an endocrine system damaged you should never inject yourself with msg but that's what health workers do when they inject you with vaccines thimerosal a methyl mercury compound that causes severe permanent nervous system damage mercury is highly toxic to the brain you should never touch swallow or inject mercury at any dose there is no safe dose of mercury doctors and vaccine pushers lie to you and say there is no mercury in vaccines but that's utterly false even the CDC readily admits right on its own website that vaccines still contain mercury now consider this the most common side effect the vaccine injection is a headache the CDC admits that over 30% of those receiving vaccines experience headaches or migraines gee think about it what could possibly be in vaccines that would cause headaches migraines and brain damage how about the mercury the formaldehyde the aluminum and the SG even if you believe in the theory of vaccines is a helpful way to train the immune system to recognize pathogens why would anyone especially a doctor think it's okay to inject human beings with mercury MSG formaldehyde and aluminum if vaccines are supposed to be good for you then why do they contain so many additives that are bad for you you wouldn't want to eat mercury in your doughnut fish you wouldn't want msg in a sandwich and you certainly wouldn't want formaldehyde in your soda so why would you allow yourself to be injected with these same deadly substances and just as importantly why wouldn't the vaccine industry offer clean vaccines without any brain damaging additives think about it when you buy health food you want that health food to have no mercury no MSG and certainly no formaldehyde no sane person would knowingly eat those neurotoxic poisons and yet astonishingly those same people literally line up to be injected with those exact same brain damaging poisons with the justification that somehow this injection is good for me absurdly the vaccine industry says these toxic ingredients are intentionally added to vaccines to make them work better yes that's the reason they give us mercury makes vaccines work better they insist mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics there have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservative and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children these new studies suggest that the opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance but wait a minute I thought the theory behind vaccines was that weakened viruses would give the immune system a kind of rehearsal so that it would build up antibodies to the real thing where does mercury MSG or formaldehyde fit anywhere in that theory does your body benefit in any way from exposure to formaldehyde of course not the very idea is ludicrous so are there such things as clean vaccines I challenge you to try to find one they simply don't exist for the population at large nearly all vaccines for the masses are deliberately formulated with neuro toxic chemicals that have absolutely nothing to do with the science of vaccinations but everything to do with autism Alzheimer's disease early onset dementia immune suppression and the mass dumbing down of brain function here take a look at some of the toxic effects listed in the material safety data sheets of these chemicals which are intentionally added to vaccines formaldehyde synonym morbid potential acute health effects very hazardous in case of eye contact hazardous in case of skin contact corrosive severe overexposure can result in death mutagenic effects mutagenic for mammalian somatic cells the substance may be toxic to kidneys liver skin central nervous system repeated or prolonged exposure to the substance can produce target organs damage exposure to formaldehyde and methanol may cause adverse reproductive effects and birth defects exposure to formaldehyde may cause cancer may cause irreversible eye damage may also affect metabolism behavior central nervous system excitement central nervous system depression convulsions stupor aggression headache weakness dizziness drowsiness coma ingestion harmful if swallowed may be fatal causes gastrointestinal irritation with nausea vomiting possibly with blood diarrhea severe pain in mouth throat and stomach and possible corrosive injury to the gastro intestinal mucosa ulceration or bleeding from stomach use used as a disinfectant biocide and in manufacture of phenolic resins and adhesives do you see a pattern here many of the health effects of formaldehyde are identical to the neurological side-effects observed in vaccine victims vomiting gastrointestinal tract irritation reproductive effects and birth defects damage to vision organ damage and so on and that's just one of the many neurotoxic additives the CDC admits are intentionally added to vaccines thimerosal is another preservative that's still widely used across the vaccine industry here's the MSDS on Mercury the primary ingredient in thimerosal mercury very hazardous in case of skin contact irritant of ingestion of inhalation skin contact may produce burns severe overexposure can result in death skin inflammation is characterized by itching scalding reddening or occasionally blistering may be toxic to blood kidneys liver brain peripheral nervous system central nervous system repeated or prolonged exposure to the substance can produce target organs damage may affect genetic material may cause cancer based on animal data passes through the placental barrier in animals may cause adverse reproductive effects paternal effects spermatogenesis effects on fertility Phaedo toxicity post implantation mortality and birth defects now think about the most common immediate side effects of vaccine injections we already mentioned headaches but the second most common side effect is skin irritation at the site of the injection itching reddening pain and inflammation these are almost exactly the same side effects listed for exposure to mercury mercury causes infertility so do vaccines vaccines are made with mercury so it's no surprise mercury causes brain damage and organ damage so do vaccines vaccines are made with mercury so it's no surprise formaldehyde causes seizures blindness comas and death so do vaccines vaccines are made with formaldehyde so it's no surprise people you wouldn't eat these ingredients not by a long shot so why do you allow yourself to be injected with them if you really want to be healthy it only makes sense that you first have to stop poisoning your brain your organs and your entire body with mercury from aldehyde MSG and aluminum all of which are intentionally added to vaccines and approved by the FDA and the CDC for use in vaccines now finally you might ask well wait a minute if vaccines caused so much brain damage then half the population should be brain damaged right the real kicker here is they are look around you people are dumb down like never before the public education system is watered down to the point where schools are little more than daycare even supposedly educated adults have virtually no decision-making skills at least half the population is walking around in a zombie State day after day try to talk to someone about something intelligent like the Federal Reserve or vaccines GMOs or even the truth about 9/11 and you'll quickly realize that people are dumbed down they are brain-damaged victims of the vaccine industry mission accomplished by the medical poisoners because as George Carlin once said the very last thing the global controllers want is for people to be educated enough to ask intelligent questions about what's going on around them you're supposed to be dumb down just smart enough to operate your PC at work but so brain-damaged that you can't really question anything they're supposed to be a cog in the machine and let the government tell you what to eat how to think and how to live your entire life intelligence is the enemy of oppression intelligence leads to freedom and that's why the race is on to vaccinate as many people as possible before so many of us figure out what's going on that we challenge the system so take your vaccine shots if you want to live a comfortable numb conformist life of mediocrity and ignorance and remember the vaccine industry will gladly reinsert you into the matrix where you can happily live out your life under the illusion that you're being taken care of
1,"Dancing Cats comes from an epidemic that occurred
 in Minimata, Japan following World War II. Villagers in a fishing community noticed cats
 seemed to be dancing, started reporting it to the local newspaper. It turned out that
 soon infants began to have seizures. Older people began to have abnormalities of vision
 and hearing and numbness and tingling, which seemed to be signs of methylmercury poisoning.
 So the term “dancing cats” was derived from an epidemic that was caused by an environmental
 toxin at a polyvinyl chloride manufacturing site on the banks of the bay that first affected
 cats before it spread to humans. And actually, Dancing Cats was covered up for almost 20
 years. Neither manufacturer, the Japanese Medical Association, or the doctor who worked
 for the company revealed to the villagers they were being poisoned by the fish they
 were eating. The term “Silent Canaries” is well-known. Canaries were always brought
 into coal mines. They would stop singing if the oxygen was being replaced by potentially
 toxic gases, such as methane or carbon monoxide. We feel that, in some respects, children being
 brought into existence are being surrounded by mineshaft. The mineshaft consists of toxins,
 and many of these babies are becoming silent. Some become silent because they don’t survive
 the first year; they die mysteriously at age two to eight months of a disease we call sudden
 infant death syndrome, otherwise known as crib death. Crib death may be avoidable. It
 seems to arisen in parallel with the introduction of PVC into our baby mattresses. When Dr.
 Sanjay Gupta talks about toxic America and talks about PVC, he makes reference to the
 fact that the instance of autism near PVC manufacturing sites is higher than elsewhere.
 The instance of liver cancer among PVC workers is higher. He doesn’t mention the fact that
 babies are confined to PVC mattresses 18 hours a day from the day they were born. He doesn’t
 mention the fact that car seats, playpens, strollers are invariably made from PVC. PVC
 is not only extraordinarily toxic in its own right, it contains antimony, a fire retardant.
 Many cases, arsenic is present with antimony, or it’s been added as a fungicide. Phosphorus
 is added as a stabilizer. The net result is that a baby mattress is a cesspool of toxins.
 They become more accessible to a baby if the mattress becomes mildewed. There’s no question,
 though. Though the theory advanced by Dr. Richardson in 1989 was dispelled after four
 years of research in the U.K., in order to change what Richardson was saying, we have
 to go back to another epidemic that occurred in 1891. That epidemic involved babies dying
 in SIDS like fashion on the floors during the winter in fashionable homes in Europe.
 The homes all contained a beautiful Paris Green wallpaper. Paris Green was used to make
 them vivid colors, particularly the green that was fashionable. Unfortunately, it was
 made from arsenic. All the chemist had to do was identify arsenic in the wallpaper,
 identify mildew on the wallpaper, and he had the answer to the epidemic. Arsine gas was
 being liberated by the accent of mildew. Not surprisingly, Richardson, in 1989, thought
 he was actually repeating the research done in 1891 by Gosio, the famous chemist. But
 instead, Richardson was finding antimony was being metabolized by mildew through a process
 of methylation into the gas known as stibine. Antimony is used as a fire retardant in mattresses.
 So not only is the PVC dangerous, but the antimony is extremely dangerous. We recently
 had an epidemic of ten babies die in Fort Bragg in North Carolina in the same housing.
 Three of the babies actually died in the same house. It’s almost a vivid sighting, once
 again, of what happened in 1891, and yet no one can draw the conclusion there was anything
 in those houses that was similar and may have been responsible for the deaths of those ten
 babies. As I was developing the whole theme around PVC, it became apparent that many of
 our autistic children are toxic with antimony and arsenic. A lot of people don’t know
 where it’s coming from. Well, simply put, it’s coming, most likely, the baby mattress
 because we contaminated the baby mattresses early on. But we did something further to
 children. We started giving them a non-precedent number of vaccines beginning on the first
 day of life. There’s no question: If you look at vaccines, which aside from PVC being
 one of the biggest mistakes of the twentieth century, we added vaccines, which may be the
 second biggest mistake. What we did was we took a child that lay in a crib made of PVC
 99.9 percent of the time that possibly is already contaminated by another baby sleeping
 on it previously, and we’re adding vaccines beginning on day one. Then we start hitting
 them again at two, four, six, eight months of age, the period of SIDS. Everyone says
 there’s no correlation between vaccines and SIDS, but temporarily, there has to be.
 And when we look at the vaccine information statements and as I was writing the book,
 I realized every parent is entitled to know the risk as well as the benefits of the vaccine
 their child is about to be given. A brief sampling of offices revealed that most parents
 aren’t getting any information at all about the risk for fear they might say no. Well,
 there can be no informed consent if you don’t know the risk. The next thing I found out
  – and unfortunately, this was a self-realization  – when I examined my own conscience as
 an emergency physician for 35 years, I realized that although I was technically a part of
 the adverse vaccine event reporting system, I realized I had never reported a single illness
 as a possible adverse event. Well, since 1986, there had been 300,000 reports of adverse
 events, ranging from sudden infant death to febrile seizures to vomiting, diarrhea, irritability
 and lethargy. So I started calling my colleagues, and I realized I wasn’t alone. Then I realized
 the actual childhood vaccine information act was something that designed to protect manufacturers
 and hold them innocent of any dangers that may be presented with their vaccines, and
 it also held doctors innocent of liability. But if was all dependent upon a passive surveillance
 system we call VAERS, and if VAERS is not reporting or not getting the reports, we may
 be basing our reports on vaccine safety on as few as one percent of the illnesses that
 they’re actually causing. It really gave me another reason for calling the second part
 of the title “Silent Canaries” –babies are not being given a chance. The idea of
 a vaccine being given on day one in the nursery for hepatitis B intuitively makes no sense.
 The risk factors, unless they’re there, are miniscule. The first thing I did when
 I was doing the book on SIDS a number of years ago was receive a call from a gentleman in
 New York. He said, “Dr. Davis, my baby died of SIDS, they’re telling me.” And I said,
 “Well, can you tell me anything more?” “Well, I was in the pediatrician’s office.
 I got the hepatitis B that afternoon, and 16 hours later, Lila Rose was dead. The coroner
 said there was evidence of brain swelling  – inflammation. The final report didn’t
 show that. Both the pediatrician – my child’s pediatrician – and I knew what he said,”
 so we realized that that adverse event had gone unreported. So for many years, I thought
 about that, never realizing I was part of the system that was supposed to be reporting,
 and then I suddenly concluded that – perhaps not 95 percent – perhaps as many as 99 percent
 of all adverse events are going unreported. And our entire surveillance program is woefully
 inadequate. And if, indeed, vaccines are being allowed on the market that hadn’t initially
 been tested for safety and they contain components of bovine and monkeys and abnormal genetic
 sequences we’ve seen in those vaccines, we’re looking at a time bomb. And everyone’s
 saying more, “More, more, more,” and the book is really saying, “Less, less, less.
 No more PVC; less vaccines.” The book really tells parents, in essence, “If you really
 want to protect your babies from two of the biggest dangers introduced in the last 50
 years, that parallel the epidemics we’re talking about, you have to get rid of PVC
 and you have to delay the vaccine exposures."
1,"19:55 a year of anxiety and triumphs a major medical hurdle was crossed with the discovery by dr. jonas salk of the anti polio vaccine which was to spread a mantle of protection over millions of American children and the scientists entered the ranks of the medical Immortals leading drug firms shifted into high gear to meet a national demand which spread to every crossroads despite early controversy each hastily set up center became non mecca for anxious parents shepherding little Johnny and little Jill to their inoculations they're protected and it didn't hurt of it any mention of modern medical miracles would have to put vaccines at the top of the list after all think of the end of the great plagues of smallpox that killed hundreds of thousands of people think of polio measles mumps chicken pox diphtheria indeed it is the advances in immunization and with that our vaccines that have helped numerous individuals prevent illnesses that otherwise would have shortened their lives at least that's what we've been told are vaccines safe and effective if you ask any major public health official pediatrician and scientist they'll say of course what is causing the epidemic in autism a controversy has swirled around the use of thimerosal in vaccines by Marisol was comprised of 49.6% mercury unknown neurotoxin are there any babies that died from what is called sudden infant death syndrome that actually died because of vaccines more than 3000 Americans are now in prison having been convicted of shaken baby syndrome is it possible that hot lots are bad defective vaccine matches actually was the culprit and not the parent a linear Co went to prison for life why because he was accused and found guilty of having shaken his baby what if a linear code was the victim along with his baby of a hot lot bad batch of vaccines the medical authorities the police investigators the courts no one chose to look at that possibility we will sadly many studies have shown vaccination to be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome one study found the peak incidence occurred at two to four months in the United States precisely when the first two routine immunizations are given and half of sudden infant death cases are caused by vaccines that's about 2,500 to 5,000 infants per year one of these infants was Alan York owes 10 month old son Alan the medical diagnosis was shaken baby syndrome and in February of 1999 Alan York Oh was sentenced to life plus 10 years with no chance of parole in 2003 we took our cameras to Florida's century Correctional Institution to interviewing lay out the evidence that supports madison's there's quite a bit my child who was premature quite sickly when born his little chest was concaved and as he would breathe you could literally see his little chest caving in in exposing his rib cage in trying to get the oxygen that he needed he fed well you know at first he saw the pediatrician every week because he was a special care baby so we actually didn't know this pediatrician he was kind of thrown on us in the HMO style and every time that we had taken a man to the pediatrician the pediatrician would just disregard this as being overprotective worrywarts of parents and would explain it away by one thing or another oh it's his food oh you know what the congestion it was the tubes that had to be put down his throat when he was born in his nose and things of this nature and so and of course your you learn to trust your pediatrician we thought we were good parents we had outlined a you know contingency plans if you know something happened what we would do and we thought we were doing all the right things then came time for vaccinations DHI bee at be DTP and polio vaccine all in one day regardless of all those things that were still going on with him he received all six of those shots in one day I in effect arbitrarily trusted my son's life to a stranger man I never knew just kind of trusted him because he had a white coat on had Ida done something a little different then then maybe things would be a little different he might be whether he might be alive or not is something that can be argued until cows come home this gets complicated the story of vaccines the greater good versus the risk no matter how small to the individual it's a debate that began in this country nearly 300 years ago over small pox Edward Jenner a country doctor formulated the idea vaccination fashioned after the old country tell that those who got cow pox were protected from smallpox in order to test this theory on May 14 1796 he removed some fluid from the sera Nelms hand which had kal pox lesions and injected it into the arm of James Phipps who was a healthy eight year old boy later Jenner injected the boy with smallpox when James did not come down with smallpox Jenner concluded quote the cow pox protects the human Constitution from the infection of smallpox unquote that is the entire basis upon which the entire field of vaccination grew a close look at history reveals that the entire case based on smallpox eradication is itself unscientific some believe it is a total fraud and all one has to do is be honest objective and simply look at the facts not dogma a small pox scared grips Great Britain in the wake of five deaths attributed to the disease that was all but wiped out in Western nations tens of thousands throughout the nation line up at health centers to be inoculated as officials attribute the up rate to a smallpox barring Pakistani who arrived from his homeland a few weeks ago there is an epidemic in that tiny country and health authorities embarked on wholesale inoculations to prevent any such occurs in Britain young and old they all take it in their stride the u.s. medical men have joined in urging all travelers to be inoculated if they haven't been within the past year there are many doctors at the time that actually stated that in fact these illnesses were caused by the living conditions around during those days how it seemed to be much more prudent or a bit more palatable as far as the wealthy landowners were concerned as far as the factory owners grew concerned as both government was concerned to try and find the panacea for these illnesses without having to deal with all these social conditions that cow parks inoculation had protected James Phipps from smallpox within a matter of a couple of years that observation was translated into six languages his cow pox vaccination became routine by the the sort of the the the mid to late 1800s and early 1900s and by 1977 smallpox a disease which killed 500 million people in the world's history was eliminated the death rate from smallpox went up markedly as the O'Neill's that went up because of the use of the vaccine all these vaccines were introduced at the tail end of the decline all the declines occurred well before vaccines it has always been about better food and better living conditions and never has it been about medical intervention by injecting poisons pathogens or whatever on from the vaccine into the blood you have bypassed what most of your immune system when we bypass that natural protection we attack the baby's cells we attack the baby's health via the backdoor the whole principle of vaccines is very naive it's very old or we're using it as a commercial application of an idea that's at least 150 years old the argument that the pharmaceutical companies make is very deceptive the assumption is vaccination is a good thing in order for it to work we have to spread it as widely as we possibly can because otherwise the people who are not vaccinated will start a disease moving through the entire population therefore we must work really really really hard to get these things in to everybody in the meantime every single dose of vaccination that is sold brings them a tidy profit I think parents are wondering why every time industry produces a vaccine it is automatically added to the mandatory list for school entry in the United States the number of mandatory vaccine injections has risen to 36 per child each of these injections contains neurotoxins such as aluminum formaldehyde aborted fetal tissue animal by-products heavy metals many others what happens to a child's fragile immune system when it's overloaded with these toxins it is my opinion that a majority of cases now being attributed to shaken baby syndrome are in fact delayed vaccine reactions we're not given any pamphlets that are by law supposed to be given out to parents when a child is to receive vaccinations however we were told that your child may develop a high-pitched cry you know he may drop off and his eating and sleeping patterns he may become warm to the touch but these are all normal and don't worry about it because they'll go away his temperature went up his feeding pattern was markedly different but this was normal so we just gazed upon it with guarded concern never vaccinate a sick child because their immune system is is crippled and that's always a dangerous situation I totally slept the whole vaccination thing I worship the vaccines just like people do finally I thought they were the sacred cow never would questioned by that weekend it was about the tenth day or so after his shots this is when he developed that high-pitched cry at first when Ellen and I heard it we kind of giggled like what is that because we had never heard this cry before Ellen and I discussed well if he's not any better come Monday that will take him into the doctor again well that Monday morning came and I got up and little did I know that I would literally kiss my family goodbye for the last time he was a little fussy that morning he didn't take his whole bottle he had a couple spit ups I noticed that he was very still I didn't know he'd stop breathing at first I ran red lights fishtailed into the emergency room I handed the baby over the counter in the emergency room and I said please make him breathe again doctors they got him resuscitated talking to the doctors they were saying well we think it's sepsis we're gonna take him to the bigger Hospital Florida Hospital gonna do a life flight or a transport over there and it was a long day there at that hospital in a waiting room and there we sat and sat and sat no one would talk to us no one would tell us what was going on going back and forth with friend what could have been what happened I don't know around 10 o'clock that night that doctor come up doctor Benji's and had a little conference with us and he sat us down in chairs and quite coldly as a matter of factly said your baby has broken ribs and bleeding on the brain and he's gonna die I lost it at that point I immediately lost it and I wound up having to be sedated I think you got the wrong baby can you check this I mean I've seriously thought he had the wrong baby broken ribs bleeding in the brain there's no broken ribs this mix-up some type of oopsie Daisy are you saying no this is your baby and we have the x-rays here and that's that other we need to know what happened because you couldn't reach the 26,000 children a year who you believe are getting hepatitis B you decided to vaccinate all the children in the United States that's correct and in fact that is a well accepted public health approach and policy the idea that you would in fact vaccinate every single person born with a whole range of toxic chemicals essentially and think that that was in fact helping them is not a sound thought a billion and a half dollars has been paid to parents whose children have either died or been named by vaccinations this is just a commercial operation it's nothing to do with health I don't believe any more the United States uses more vaccines than any country in the world we have the most highly vaccinated population particularly child population in the world it's projected to be a twenty billion dollar business by the year 2020 when dr. Shara appeared on ABC's 20/20 in January he said that he honestly believed the hepatitis B vaccine had not caused any problems can an employee of a pharmaceutical company that manufactures a vaccine be objective in designing experiments to show fault in a product that generates close to a billion dollars in sales for his company there is an alliance between the pharmaceutical industry that produces vaccines the federal agencies that regulate and recommend vaccines for mass use and the doctors who give vaccines we are given journals to read with articles reporting of results of studies that are primarily bought and paid for by the pharmaceutical industry we have drug reps come to our office and bring us cushy little meals and give us a spiel about a drug which they learned in a weekend seminar and doctors are getting this as their major source of information I spoke to the head of CDC the person who actually put these programs in place and he told me specifically that he was terminated in his job because he refused to make the public the annual public announcement that influenza VEX vaccine should be administered now everyone should go get their flu shots what Americans need to realize is that vaccines are not risk-free they carry a risk of injury death and that risk can be greater or lesser depending upon your individual makeup in more than twenty six states there is a movement to mandate the girls as young as 11 had the Gardasil vaccine Gardasil is the merck produced vaccine designed to protect against four of the over 100 strains of the human papilloma virus however according to the lead researcher dr. Diane Harper a Dartmouth Medical School vote giving it to 11-year olds is a great big public health experiment it is silly to mandate vaccination of 11 and 12 year old girls there's not enough evidence gathered on the side effects to know that safety is not an issue in quote in addition Hsieh stated the Gardasil was never fully tested on young girls all of the trials were with girls 15 to 25 years old and in her personal opinion the vaccine should only be used with girls 18 and up I think that Merck deserves the Oscar for marketing they're selling the thing as a cancer scare without telling you number one you still might get cancer from the other thirty percent number two you can't be positive for the HPV that it says that it protects against at the time you get it number three that even if you do get it at the proper time you don't know whether it's going to work for 20 years and then you are only going to know that it hasn't worked if you fail to get your pap smears I started receiving calls from constituents became apparent that the public really wasn't educated about this particular disease or even about the viral vaccine itself we're supposed to be a free country but in this area we certainly are not a free country and then certainly when it has to do with their health of our children this is one of the most basic rights we should have that don't have employees in the federal government who worked with the FDA regulating vaccines or work at the CDC making policy for vaccines recommending mass use of vaccines can leave government service and then go to work for the vaccine manufacturers literally the day after they retire this is is something that we should not accept sometimes people wonder whether or not they represent us and I think what I can say having been on that committee for five years is that not only do they represent us they are us I think that when they they sit around at that table and they try and make the decision is this vaccine safe and is this vaccine effective and will this vaccine be useful in this country and they take a decision about whether or not it should be given to children I think when they make that decision they what their one guiding principle is what I give this to my own child or my own grandchild or my own niece and nephew and only then I think and only then what are they willing to make a recommendation for children in this country they are invited into these meetings to all sit there and talk about how they can keep selling the idea to the American public that vaccines are safe that's why they hold so many vaccine meetings because they don't want the immunization program to fall because it's a multi-billion dollar industry dr. Rafat was a good example he said on he bides Advisory Board for a vaccine that he held a patent he received $350,000 for doing research on that vaccine and he was paid to go around the country and talk to doctors and tell him it was safe to use this vaccine at the same time the government tells it to safe and Cerie there is a government program called the vaccine injury compensation program which compensates the families of children who are injured and killed by vaccinations to the tune of 200 million dollars a year it is illegal in this country to sue the pharmaceutical companies and the physicians for injuries caused by vaccination and if your child is killed or injured you have to go to the government for a government handout in compensation Lindsay is representative of all the children who fall under the mandate Lindsay received the hepatitis B vaccine two days before entering high school the next day she seemed flu-like the day after that so dizzy she couldn't stand up without holding the walls the following day she passed out her ability to stand was compromised for almost six months due to unremitting dizziness following our doctor's advice Lindsay had the series of three it was on the third shot Lindsay became so violently ill within two hours that I knew the vaccine was the catalyst of her illness Lindsay is plagued on a daily basis with headaches of a severe kind joint pain seizures nausea hair loss dizziness gastro esophageal reflux and extreme fatigue my daughter shouldn't have to suffer like this because government officials and drug company executives didn't do their jobs we really have given these companies such wide latitude to develop these vaccines and not really give us full information about what the ingredients in those vaccines can do in the human body one courageous New York State physician a lady who wanted to tell the truth about vaccinations was told that that she was delusional by the very same federal agency the see that we now know accepted vaccine recommendations from a professional committee that had over half of its members from pharmaceutical companies that made those vaccinations and allowed for years deadly mercury toxins to be included in the 29 vaccinations that they claimed our children need very difficult when you've been promoting a certain way of thinking for so many years and such a big industry has grown from that idea and people are very dependent on the idea that to suddenly announce that maybe it's not the right thing to do mean difficulty with the flu for the overwhelming number of people who get it is that it forces you to take several days off from work now when they do the risk benefit relationship they don't do the health benefit versus the health risk they do the economic benefit and risk so they say four days off for X number of people cost the economy X billions of dollars and therefore it's really important to do these flu vaccines to keep people at work a public health official in illinois-chicago fought this whole kind of concept with the slogan influenza is mothers Nature's Way of telling you to slow down he would not allow the flu vaccine in his area nobody died from his not having the vaccine in his neighborhood and in fact virtually no one dies of influenza when they talk about the excess deaths those excess deaths are primarily if not exclusively from pneumonia we had outbreaks of measles and there were 55,000 cases 11,000 hospitalizations and as many as 120 deaths that occurred in the United States between 1989 and 1991 when we gave that second dose of measles vaccine that virtually eliminated the disease so now instead of having but less we did before the measles vaccine roughly a hundred thousand hospitalizations in 4,000 deaths every year from measles last year we had 37 cases of measles and no hospitalizations had no deaths I mean a dramatic example of I think the power of vaccines until they're personally affected by it they will continue to believe they're safe and they're going to help having found a polio virus that then decided that that virus was the cause of polio this never ever been proved however take the virus create a vaccine and you have yourself a multi-billion dollar industry in 1955 the announcement was made that Jonas Salk's polio vaccine worked the fact that 200 people were paralyzed after getting the shot and ten died was overlooked baby's health is still fragile we know that we need to be careful and yet we attack it from day one and make it help I do think that we could we can find that there have been some values to vaccinations in specific populations in specific timeframes but those are limited there are some instances in which vaccination can be useful in some instances in where the payoff is more important than the risk but that small opportunity to use be useful has been blown up into a major public health activity that now in dangers in my opinion every child that's born because of other people's greed our lives have been altered forever my child will never be okay never be okay vaccines cause the same symptoms as sudden infant death syndrome and SBS internal brain hemorrhage bone fracture and external bruising doctors the police and even child protective teams were quick to arrest and prosecute a linear ko not too long after that children and families was called in and investigators were called in before we knew it they were throwing out accusations of child abuse and the nature of shaken baby syndrome the doctor was meanwhile trying to ask me what happened what happened and I've told him what happened 110 I know the over hold it this what happened he stopped breathing I tried to see I got into the hospital why didn't you call the phones not huh why wouldn't they thought that I was suspicious that I didn't call 911 and wait for an ambulance um I don't know why I got him there in under four minutes and they're quick it was determined that there was bleeding within the sheath around the brain inside the skull and it was bleeding behind the eyes retinal bleeding so this combination of symptoms the the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome was triggered around 2:00 in the morning the nurses said the detectives are here they want to talk to you did you shake him no did you hurt him no did you hit him no did he drop no did he fall no is it possible that when you were running with him that maybe these pet injuries could have happened I guess it's possible but I don't think it's very problem eventually life support was taken off they rushed Francine in for life support but not before I was arrested it is a scientific reality that vaccines have caused death or permanent disability families have been torn apart medical and governmental authorities have not recognized these occurrences we've seen an increase in the number of vaccines that our children are getting we have gone from 23 doses of seven vaccines in the 1980s to 48 doses of 14 vaccines by the time a child reaches the age of 6 by time that a girl gets to be 12 years old in this country the CDC says she's got to have 56 doses of 16 vaccines with the recommendation of the HPV vaccine last year so I think that we really need to do more research into what happens when we give all these vaccines to our children when a parent asks me about a vaccine any of the vaccines I have to be honest with them and say I do not know what is going to happen to your child when and if they get this vaccine it encourages the bacteria in the body to produce toxins that are absorbed into the bloodstream the vaccines add further toxins this disturbs coagulation bleeding factors so hemorrhages start the toxins over a period of time chew up all of item and see so you get scurvy like changes in the bones which look like fractures the number of immunogenic or immunologic components contained in those vaccines don't add up to any more than about 135 or 140 that is a drop in the bucket of what a child typically encounters and manages every day the vaccine safety issue will not go away until parents get the answers to why our highly vaccinated children are so sick a patient has the right a person has the right to be fully informed about the risks of any medical intervention and the right to exercise voluntary informed consent we are desperately trying to find not the cause but the causes of autism we believe their variety of different causes for this behavioral syndrome when the CDC was asked to comment upon the toxicity of thimerosal their argument was that well there's not enough thimerosal or mercury preservative in a vaccine to cause all the damage that we're seeing in autism but that was with one vaccine no child receives one vaccine in fact depending upon the child they could receive 20 to 30 different vaccinations and 90% of them contain thimerosal my son at birth was completely normal I had up gars of 9 and 10 I met all of his developmental landmarks the first year of life he was walking and talking I have pictures of him when he was a little infant that just you could see the 21 this kids eye he lost his ability to communicate with us he stopped eating he would gag himself in vomit when he would try to eat he didn't interact with us anymore you started seeing turnaway the facial expression starting to flatten out and he wasn't quite the same initially we thought maybe he was deaf when we shared our concerns with the pediatrician she ordered tests referred us to a specialist for a hearing examination ultimately our son was diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified which is a form of autism my husband and I are both medical professionals I'm a nurse practitioner my husband as a physician and it just didn't seem right to us that our son was autistic it was at that time that Lynn heard on I believe is on the television that the FDA had come out had released a statement saying that if your child had received time aerosol containing vaccines and maybe exceeded their daily exposure of mercury but don't worry about it and I think that's what tweaked Lynn when she heard don't worry about it she says well if they're telling me not to worry about I'm gonna worry about it my son was first vaccinated unbeknownst to me he was being injected with 12.5 micrograms of mercury that's huge that amount of mercury by EPA standards and guidelines for ingested mercury you would have to weigh 225 pounds to be able to process that much mercury when a parent has a child is normally and is walking and talking and meeting milestones and then stops that parent is going to seek out help that parent is going to report it is that parent is going to do anything they can to try to get their child back I have seen children who as far as we can tell looking at videos and were completely absolutely normal in every way until they had the MMR vaccine my grandson was a normal child and two days after he got nine shots in one day several which contain thimerosal mercury 40 sometimes the amount that was tolerable in adult Merck pharmaceuticals the sole manufacturer of the MMR vaccine in the u.s. stands by its safety saying quote the vast weight of medical and scientific evidence strongly refutes an association between MMR and autism Liam was a normally developing baby until June 27th 1997 when he received his MMR and hid vaccines he did everything he was supposed to do he could rolled over crept crawled pulled up and walked right on time he said mama he said daddy he said love you it was born full-term normal in every way vaginal birth with no interventions or drugs his Apgar scores were 9 and 10 which means all his reflexes were perfect and present before discharge he was immunized with recumbents HB against hepatitis B his fourth night in this world was his first at home and about 5 hours after arriving home he had his first seizure the doctors told us we were causing Ben's seizures odd behaviors and delays by bad parenting love you Oh from the day that little jack counter was born in 1996 his proud parents began documenting his progress with a video camera shown here - uh-uh it was the first tooth the first bowl of spaghetti by and the first steps powder that's right where's the comb yeah toothpaste face Jack's parents say by the age of four he had lost all of his verbal skills communication became a series of screams and tantrums and there was other odd compulsive behavior like constant repetitive movements and licking many objects it was a urine test for fifteen toxic metals that provided Joe and Teresa counter with the first indication of what was wrong with their son the test showed that Jack's levels for arsenic cadmium and nickel were normal or within an acceptable range but look at the results for mercury the line goes off the chart I was just awestruck that the symptoms of mercury toxicity were identical to the symptoms at my son's experience we received no warning our pediatrician seemed to think this was like giving an advil or you know Tylenol or something no warning notes no don't watch out you know this is dangerous this could cause convulsions there's nothing whatsoever medical negligence when treating victims of vaccine induced injury and death is not uncommon was that the case with Alan York Oh Alan your Co has argued that there was an absence of properly executed medical examinations police investigations and an accurate autopsy all wow this is going on they're pressuring Francine to donate the organs they even forged your name on some of the papers I got a phone phone call from the nurse not even dr. Ben gets himself who on the phone said to me the doctor would like you to hurry up and get down here because he would like this over with before noon meaning they wanted me to sign off the papers so they can go ahead and whisk them off to harvest his organs terminate his life while I was there holding him with all these wires and stuff those investigators were outside the door I just lost my son I just left him he had this elaborate plan that they wanted me to get on the phone with Alan they were gonna make special arrangements that I could call into the prison facility and they wanted me to tell him that I thought that he could do something like this and let's see what you would say and when I refused to cooperate that's when they became angry and they had gotten up and they had threatened me that I myself could be arrested at 2:45 p.m. just a couple hours after he was admitted to Florida a right arterial heparin line this was not a flush this was a line for heparin heparin is an anticoagulant it promotes bleeding it prolongs bleeding it triggers and causes complications of bleeding it is absolutely contraindicated by every known medical Orthodox text on earth in patients with suspected closed head injury or CNS bleeding or any otherwise such complications why because it causes brain bleeds if you give it to an individual with any mere and hypotension and is about nine times the therapeutic dose of course you will have leaving the bleeding of three types one is organized means is attached and those fibrosis and the other clot clotted on the adult version of three stages now the theory of shaken baby syndrome they said is you you shake the baby a few second and you get a bleeding now if Alan or anybody shake the baby and there was a bleeding and the bleeding stopped I there that means what you expect you expect to see one type of living not three stages of bleeding so how a forensic pathologist would miss that I'd not and doused and the baby Alan when they they did a blood analysis and he had more than 500 thousands platelets per microliter of blood at the admission means this is normal all above normal why is above normal metal bit because the baby has anemia and this is we called hyperplasia the baby lost about 40% of the platelets and does assure you the bleeding is happening after the admission and who's doing that is the hip Holly when you get her telling the platelet stick together on top of that sodium bicarbonate in a sale 3 was administered which should be stopped when pH levels reached 7 point 2 in a diabetics condition or state and in which Allen met that criteria it would still be he was still given bicarbonate at seven point five seven point six and at seven point seven this may sound not a big deal but it would kill you or me or anyone else if you did it very fast and very effectively your brain would swell you would die they held him on life support gave"
1,"what do you think happens when we inject vaccines that contain animal DNA animal genetic matter and animal cells and other animal chemicals well we know that vaccines contain substrates from all these animals that I put up here this is also not controversial at all for instance this cocker spaniel is really cute and you might want to have a cocker spaniel as a pet but you should also know that tumorigenic cocker spaniel kidney cells are used to propagate vaccines and that some of those cells do end up in the vaccine media but we're told not to worry about it because they're only slightly tumorigenic and that's the flu vaccines we know that there is human material fetal material in vaccines they're also used fried lung fibroblasts are used to propagate now think about if you need to propagate vats and vats of vaccine in order to to make it for the entire world you need to have cells that divide really rapidly so that you can grow viruses on or that you can have bacteria growing on so that's why we need these cells in order to make the vaccines okay they don't just make themselves so this chick is also really cute but it's not really cute necessarily when it's injected into you and we know that it's a very common substrate for vaccine production this one here I find rather disturbing that is a caterpillar and that is used for the Cervarix human papilloma virus vaccine is used propagated through genetic engineering with that caterpillar cell and these monkeys again this has been part and parcel of vaccine production since the earliest times because these monkey cells they divide really rapidly and they grow viruses the polio vaccines are made on them we still have vaccines made on them today there have been lots of problems with these monkeys kidney cells some of them had been worked out but we don't you know if you don't know what can grow inside of an animal cell you can't necessarily test for it and even if you look on the vaccine package inserts you'll see vero cells listed and that comes from monkey and that's a kid monkey kidney cell we know that there's cow blood calcium albumin in vaccines and that they also boil the hides for the gelatine that's in the vaccines as well these little piggies here their stomachs are used to get clumps of cells to break apart so that you can plate them out in a petri dish and grow vaccine on it this was a problem just a few years ago we heard about the rotavirus vaccine growing a porcine surco virus but we were told not to worry about it because people that eat pork end up with it so apparently it's ok to give that to your babies - mmm there's actually not been very much research of anything I'm actually available I'm aware of as far as any long-term effects of infants consuming porcine surco virus so how do these things affect your DNA your your child's DNA function well we don't know because no one's bothered to look at the issue but consider this children receive 10 vaccinations in the 1980s before the age of five and today they get 636 vaccines beginning often in utero or on the first day of life like we do in the United States human brains and human immune systems have definitely changed for the worse and vaccines can be playing a part epigenetic cysts and vaccinologist say well vaccines can train the immune system through epigenetic reprogramming and they want us to look on the bright side they always want to paint a picture of how the immune system is going to be improved because of this but that's not what we see and that's not what much of the medical literature states even if vaccines can prevent some infections considering what's in them there's no way they can improve overall health and now they want to give vaccines to pregnant women which in addition to these animal cells and associated genetic material also have aluminium in them and you can see here dr. Paul Offit and he's the doctor that I mentioned in the beginning who says that infants can tolerate 100,000 vaccines at once theoretically although there's never been any animal model for that that's his theory well in the context of medical literature it's astonishing that one of the most well published vaccine proponents Paul Offit and he's a key opinion person who's the go-to soundbite for the American pro vaccine movement that he could publish this on his website he educates doctors worldwide on vaccinations and on his website from the Children's Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania the vaccine Education Center in April of 2013 you could have gone on there and read about your concerns about aluminium and pregnancy and you could have been totally set at ease by seeing what this website had to say because this quote was on his website and it said aluminium is considered to be an essential metal with quantities fluctuating naturally during normal cellular activity it is found in all tissues and also believed to play an important role in the development of a healthy fetus hmm well I PDF that webpage in April 2013 and I sent it with a link to one of the world's most knowledgeable aluminium experts who's usually very diplomatic and polite and he wrote me back stating something not very flattering about dr. Paul Offit which I won't repeat here but wouldn't you think that a man who considers himself highly educated would have read this following quote that was published in 2011 dr. kawahara published a very important article that needs to be read by anybody who has concerns about aluminium and amongst other things in that article in the very beginning he says whilst being environmentally abundant aluminium is not essential for life on the contrary aluminium is a widely recognized neurotoxin that a hibbett smore than 200 biologically important functions and causes various adverse effects in plants animals and humans he goes into great detail about this all the other aluminium researchers I know have no time for dr. Paul off its comments we need to look at vaccines and pregnancy more closely starting with aluminium to see what it really does do in the body doctor cow hairs article is very important because it supports with a hundred and seventy six medical references the fact that aluminium is a death factor for cells he reviews the most state-of-the-art techniques that have brought aluminium back to the forefront of Alzheimer's research and tells why in how the old research that said it wasn't related to Alzheimer's is flawed this picture denotes some of the problems that he has documented and found himself with the action of aluminium in the body now remember the aluminium is a small radius very highly positively charged element so it's going to be attracted to negative charges in the body because of that it's able to travel to places where it really should never go one of those places is into the brain and we now know that it does cross the blood-brain barrier it crosses in cells called macrophages and there are special transport systems that shuttle it through we also know the aluminium binds to phosphate in DNA and RNA in the nucleus remember all that epigenetic stuff well guess what when that binds to phosphates in the nucleus it influences many genes and regulates an abnormal ways gene function we also know that it binds to ATP that stands for adenosine triphosphate which you may have heard of is it's a it's the most important energy molecule in your body and that's what's used to give you know for me to move my muscle right now or for you to run up a hill that's what you need well aluminium binds to that and influences energy metabolism and use we know that people with aluminium excess end up with very low energy this also here is an enzyme and that's calcium or magnesium and you should know that enzymes are dependent upon certain elements and in order for them to function properly and have the right conformation they need these elements well because aluminium is such a highly negatively charged particle it actually has more of an affinity for those enzymes than the normal elements that are supposed to be working with it so it comes in pops calcium and magnesium right off and takes over and essentially inhibits those enzymes without enzymes your metabolism really can't work very well in addition to making those enzymes useless the fact that it's now bound on to them keeps it in the body longer so this makes the half-life of aluminium even longer over here we see this is an example of a protein and we know that proteins are supposed to for the most part be separate doing their jobs and when the aluminium comes along it cross links them essentially works as a tanning agent because it coagulates proteins in this way and it causes conformational change and having the right shape and the protein is really important because the shape often determines its function so those conformational changes can actually inhibit the degradation of those proteins by their particular proteases so you can't actually even use them the way your body wants to use them so aluminium is a huge deal when it comes to proper cell function so if we go back here and just remind you that it's important in the development of a healthy fetus and quantities fluctuate naturally during normal cellular activity we really have to scrutinize that the other thing aluminium does is it damages cell membranes remember I'm going to show you another picture in a minute sorry I got ahead of myself so this is a cell membrane of representation love it phospholipids here the lipids are in the middle and the phospho on the outside and in the presence of iron some of these lipid membranes can be damaged and that's why we have our own antioxidant system but in the presence of aluminium these Pro oxidant reactions are will happen more so it's called / oxidation so it's basically like hydrogen peroxide which actually can be very toxic to cells so an aluminium comes in with this iron it will catalyze using certain enzymes and cause problems in that membrane and remember what I showed you earlier that the cell membranes and the environment and what's happening in those membranes has everything to do with how genes function and how the cell functions and how cells talk to each other and whether they grow or whether they die or differentiate and turn into different cells or whether they turn into cancer have a look at this schematic of a cell membrane which is actually more realistic appearing than the one you saw before and consider that each of each of your cells has around a hundred thousand switches we have what are called receptors and effectors meaning it has a signal comes in and then it has an action okay now that opens and closes to various substances on the outside and it transmits signals to the inside telling the nucleus what to do then consider the fact that after aluminium exposure the membranes and the myelin which is very important for nerve function becomes stiff and dysfunctional dr. burr Stratton wrote two articles that are really important that detailed and in his experimental model showing how the membranes changed in the face of aluminium and dr. kawahara listed several pages of the biological processes that are significantly altered during low levels of aluminium and he talked about three of them with medical references and how they changed the lipid and phospholipids in in the body how they change the physical properties of this membrane and how they change this membrane fluidity I think of this as like a kind of car wash that you can go through that has the flaps that go down and so your proteins are needing to move through this like it's fluid it's almost like it's a matrix that these proteins can can pop up and they can come back down and they can migrate and and it's very important that they're able to move around the way they're supposed to and that this this this area stays functional so when you toss aluminium into that everything changes the signals that are coming through are altered now this slide looks like a handful but I'm gonna explain everything in it to you okay because well never mind because I'm going to explain this slide in detail so this da M PS stands for damage associated molecular patterns and these are basically things that your cells recognize as alarm signals and in response to that they secrete chemicals called cytokines which recruit other cells which come and clean up the mess and deal with it okay and in that process can be very inflammatory and then the anti-inflammatory side comes down and dampens it down this is called pathogen associated molecular patterns but that's not what I'm going to talk about right now the aluminium comes in causes cell damage secretes all the insides of cells which alert the immune system and bring those substances that it came and encountered including the aluminium and the stuff that leaked out of cells and brings it to what's called an antigen presenting cell that antigen presenting cell then starts to secrete its own cytokines and we'll call in T cells these T cells will then recruit other generations of cells to either inflame to clean up a mess because sometimes inflammation is good it actually helps clean up problems and kill bacteria and dead flesh and and and remove that dead flesh and then you need the anti-inflammatory arm to come along and silence that but what happens with aluminium is that this pro-inflammatory response which is a th17 gets set off this one here which is a t follicular helper cell system gets set off and this one here the humoral immunity which is the side that antibodies are secreted and can be associated with allergies also get set off and this is very well documented and established in molecular biology that this th2 system is skewed and biased after the exposure to aluminium and it's actually the basis for why they use it in vaccines so these infiltrating cells that come in here these phagocytes here they will come in and they will have an unlimited diet of aluminium now that's different than if you get a cut on your skin that can be dealt with and it's done and over with these persistent particles continue to stimulate this process and set off an oxidative stress bonfire in the skin in the system and causes massive amounts of inflammation these cells will eat until they die and then they will release their various substances and continue that process this is just a better schematic of what happens in the cell so this is the aluminium adjuvant that's what it's called adjuvant meaning that it helps the vaccine have its inflammatory response we have cell damage because where that needle goes makes all the difference and whether there's a needle or not makes all the difference when it comes to aluminium I'm just going to step aside and just explain this top part for a minute because the other thing that we hear on websites like dr. pol office is that we shouldn't be worried about aluminium because it's a very abundant metal in the Earth's crust and we're eating and drinking it all the time and it's in our baked goods and we shouldn't be worried about it mm-hmm well when you eat aluminium you absorb somewhere between 0.2 percent and 1.5 percent of it okay when you inject aluminium you absorb a hundred percent of it now you can inject it in two ways you can put it directly into a blood vessel which is how the one study that they use for injection did it put it right into intravenously we don't get this happening when you put that into a blood vessel you don't have that kind of cell damage and all this inflammatory response when you put it into a blood vessel the trick is to inject it into a muscle and that's why vaccines are delivered into muscles because the goal for a vaccine an injected intramuscular vaccine is to put this adjuvant in there with the particle of either virus or bacteria and set off an immune reaction that hopefully your cells will remember when they're encountered with that same microbe in the future so remember that intramuscular is key to causing the damage that I'm talking about here now drinking it is still not a good idea but you need a lot more of it to become toxic as long as you have normal kidney function okay so this adjuvant is injected you get the cell damaged and what happens when you get cell damage is that the cells usually will just break open the Mehta's membranes will open and their contents will spill out well it turns out that some of the contents inside of cells are designed to be inflammatory it's almost like an acid in there because you want it to be there if you want it to take in a microbe and dissolve it but what you don't want to happen is for those cells to then break open and cause more inflammation in the body and that can happen sometimes which is why we need all those antioxidants in our diet and in our bodies but normally that shouldn't be going on and on and on but what happens here is that the cell breaks open ATP comes out DNA comes out uric acid comes out these phago lysosomes break open and spill their contents all highly inflammatory okay so then you're calling in more immune cells and more T helper cells to come in and deal with the problem they come in and they encounter more aluminum and it's basically a vicious cycle that continues to go on until the body can finally get them get on top of it and in some vaccines it's actually worse than others we're finding that in the Gardasil vaccine this is a big problem and that these these dendritic cells that get activated sometimes they don't shut off and this inflammation continues so the dose of the of the aluminium the state the anti-inflammatory state that it's injected into and where in the body it's injected is really important needle into muscle is what's key so if any wants to argue with you about aluminium asking them about the different routes of how it can come into the body well it's presumed that aluminium is safe because it's been used in food and vaccines for 70 years not because it's been tested against placebo and people follow it out for long term but just because it's been done for so long because of that it continues to be added to the vaccine schedule with callous disregard for the many mechanisms of cell injury and the vast medical literature on its toxicity when it's injected especially in America we are giving our babies their first dose of aluminium during pregnancy and then we're giving them the second one on day one of birth when they get 250 micrograms shot and then just like you do here we start off with the 1200 microgram doses that boy that I was presenting today he got eight different antigens on one day three times in a row that was a huge aluminium load that he got and by the time babies are 18 months old they're getting around four point nine grams sorry four thousand nine hundred and twenty-five micrograms brought in to their bodies well there's one really important detail that's almost always left out the discussion when it comes to aluminium whether it's injection or ingestion and that is what is the kidney function of the person that has taken it in well we know over history that when aluminium is in dialysis fluids that those patients get really sick their bones get sick their brains don't function properly and it's a big problem you know we worked really aggressively to get that aluminium out of the dialysis water before giving dialysis it's that important if you don't have normal kidney function now if you've got any degree of kidney dysfunction chances are the aluminium is not going to be excreted as if you have a hundred percent of kidney function well who has low kidney function it turns out that infants don't have the same percentage when you compare it using the same measurements as adults have and that premature infants have really low kidney clearance so you know to do these calculations and reassure parents that everything is fine because we've injected aluminium into one adult man intravenously and he got rid of it all we can't reassure parents about injecting it into their their newborns or their babies because normal kidney function is about 90 milligrams re MLS per minute per 1.73 meter squared we have ways of measuring that and that's just the standard consideration that greater than 90 is considered normal well when a premature baby is born it's around 20 and then we can see over here that as time goes on the average what we call glomerular filtration rate or the clearance of substances through the kidney that need filtration and a 2 to 8 day old average is only around 40 and then it ranges from 17 to 60 so some of them have actually really low clearance and they never checked to see what it is before injecting aluminium in these babies and you can see that even up to 2 to 12 years they say it can only be on a low level on the low range here 89 but on average up to 6 months most kids don't have their kidney function up to speed so we have to take this into consideration when doing these analyses and you very rarely almost actually I've never seen this taken into consideration with an aluminium analysis there very few of them out there that have actually injected real babies and looked to see what happened afterwards but there is one that came out this year by dr. Moses and what she did was she injected two month-old human infants with three of the intramuscular was one injection but three vaccines and this is basically just according to the schedule for a total of twelve hundred micrograms of aluminium per the usual infant schedule with this this amounts to about 545 micrograms per kilogram of baby weight hmm the conclusion of this study after they measured the urine and blood aluminium levels for 12 hours after they injected it was that they said that they were reassured to find that there was no significant post vaccine rise in serum aluminium level after vaccination of preterm infants containing twelve hundred micrograms in other literature and that in their study they found that there also was no rise in the blood levels and urine levels after injection so I thought to myself well why would you be relieved by that you've you've injected aluminium and you see that it doesn't rise in the blood and it doesn't rise in the urine where did it go and so I wrote to this doctor and I asked her and I said are you aware that the kidney function of these babies is actually really low and so I wouldn't I'm not surprised to not see a lot of aluminium in the urine and you didn't find it in the blood so where else could it have gone it could only go to organs and to bone and she wrote me back and she said quote so we don't really know what happens to the aluminium at this point in time as you said more research is needed in this area okay there's something called a minimal risk level that is a theoretical calculation that shouldn't be exceeded according to this theoretical calculation because there could be neurotoxicity and that's really the problem with aluminium is that primarily a brain is very sensitive to it and the nervous system is very sensitive to it well this is a really interesting paper because they did these calculations and if you go and you read the paper you see that first off the calculations were based on rodents that were eating aluminium and the other way they looked at it was that one injection study by priests that I mentioned already which looked at one man who got a very small it was 0.7 micrograms ok that's nowhere near what a baby gets intravenously and they they tagged it with a radio labeled it was radio labeled aluminium so that they could trace it in this in his system over time and see where it went and what they found was that they said it was great because all the aluminium disappeared from the blood after two days and only about fifteen percent of it was taken up into the body and not immediately excreted but that the Halloween and aluminium in his body was down to four percent after eleven hundred and seventy eight days so that's about three years and they also used the form of aluminium that's not as toxic as the aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate that's used in vaccines they use aluminium citrate his kidneys were also normal so the this is the these are the measurements that they're using for their theoretical calculation an intravenous dose in one man a very low dose with normal kidneys and and rats eating aluminium and based on that they say that we shouldn't exceed a certain dose of aluminium every day and then they look at their theoretical ingestion both in breast milk and it is there's a vault with low levels of aluminium in breast milk there's low levels in formula there's higher levels in vaccines and so they looked at that and they saw well this is what we're calculating as the minimal risk line and let's see if we add all this together if it goes higher than that minimal risk line and conveniently we see that only spike through a little bit right there well one of the things with breast milk and formula is that the aluminum in in substances that we eat has silicate on it that's what's in the Earth's crust it's totally different than this aluminum phosphate and this aluminum hydroxide that we're ingesting okay but the other problem with this analysis was that they only looked at hepatitis B and the DTP vaccine they left out pneumococcal and him and hepatitis A which was another 600 micrograms of aluminium so even though they found that there were spikes for about three days at a time that went through this minimum risk level they reassuring that it's probably okay to have these vaccines and it's it's not really a big problem in the formula breast milk because look it comes right back down and stays below that line but what I'm telling you is that these babies don't have kidney function that's as high as that adult man or those rats that were tested that we are injecting it in a form that they weren't using in those animal studies and that they didn't look at the whole vaccine schedule so this essentially is telling you that it can be toxic even with these small amounts of vaccines with this terrible analysis dr. Cohn and other scientists in 2013 looked at the transport of aluminium into the brain and after noting that trans after that after they did this full analysis they noted that translocation does happen after intramuscular injections they specifically looked at inter muscular injections and then they issued a recommendation about that at the end of their paper and they said aluminium has high neurotoxic potential and planning administration of continuously escalating doses of this poorly biodegradable adjuvant in the population should be carefully evaluated by regulatory agencies since the compound may be insidiously unsafe it is likely that good tolerance to aluminium may be challenged by a variety of factors including over immunization blood-brain barrier immaturity and individual acceptability factors and aging that may be associated with subtle blood-brain barrier alterations and a progressive increase of these special transporters that I mentioned earlier called ccl2 they can be higher in some people especially as we age those transporters tend to go up so the problem with aluminium is that the reason for its use and its efficacy and its toxicity are actually one in the same the inflammation caused by intramuscular injection adds to the accumulation in lymph nodes spleen liver brain kidney kidney it actually is highest but then when they went and looked they found that it's even higher deposition in the bone so all those organs accumulate aluminium and all of us as we grow older but if we're purposefully injecting it into a muscle and it doesn't have a way to get out very easily this problem is even bigger well in the 1980s the amount of aluminium and your vaccine schedule was eleven hundred and twenty micrograms for the whole schedule and today it's six thousand 150 micrograms and the year that you did them the men ZB vaccine it was much higher than that about five thousand micrograms higher for those vaccines those started at six weeks of age kidney function was not up to 100% at that point well there are more properties of aluminium I can't I can't tell you all of them and all the two hundred biological processes inhibits but there are a few more studies that are worth mentioning there's one that showed that damaged thymocyte and lymphocyte plasma membranes so the thymus is really important in training the the T cells what to react to and what not to react to that was dr. Camel off and he said it was at clinically relevant doses meaning they were not giving mega doses to these animals it also is known to enhance what's known as excitotoxin II in the brain which I'll tell you more about that in a minute these cells microglia are really important in the brain you don't want them to be in a high inflammatory state but aluminium activates them and inflames them the literature is just abundant with articles and experiments that show that aluminium interferes with gene expression it increases vascular endothelial de Cygnus and dr. Auster link stated point-blank that aluminium is pro-inflammatory and opposes a cardiovascular disease risk so for the rest of us that are adults and being recommended are aluminium containing vaccines we also need to think of this the Cochrane Collaboration is a global independent network that tries to present evidence-based reviews dr. Thomas Jefferson came out with a surprising conclusion on the risk of adverse events after immunization with aluminium containing DPT vaccines he said that despite a lack of good quality evidence we do not recommend that any further research on this topic is undertaken put the lid on it why I thought why on earth and I kept reading and the answer became obvious assessment of the safety of aluminium in vaccines is important because replacement of aluminium compounds in currently licensed vaccines would necessitate the introduction of a completely new compound that would have to be investigated before licensing it would also have to be paid for through research and development for all the vaccine companies that would have to get new patents on their vaccines no obvious candidates to replace aluminium are available they've tried a few it didn't go well so withdrawal for safety reasons would severely affect the immunogenicity and protective effect of some currently licensed vaccines and threatened immunization programs worldwide in other words your individual safety is not of primary importance and we don't need to be doing any research close the book well pregnant women in America are recommended to get several aluminium containing vaccines all of these accept influenza vaccine contains aluminium and all of these vaccines cause massive inflammation and during pregnancy it's really important not to have massive inflammation"
1,it's funny you mentioned the reporting that goes on or lack of for some of these vaccines you go back to the flu shot and there does seem to be reporting and two years ago I think they said there was maybe nine percent effective for for a certain population maybe use the elderly I can't remember in this this most recent year I think the effectiveness for them the main vaccine was forty seven percent and I look at those numbers and I'm like well nine percent is nothing forty percent is better than fifty you know it's not even fifty fifty what are your chances of getting the flu either way probably you know not as good as even that those numbers to me don't seem to support the effectiveness of the vaccine no and they consider like seventy to eighty percent really good and so for some strange some years it might be that high but you know they removed the inhaled influenza vaccine this year because it was only three percent effective and you know people assume that they go and they get their child vaccinated and they're going to be protected even after one shot but the fact is that even after three or four shots of some vaccines you're only 65 to 85 percent protected even with the measles vaccine they're between two and ten percent of people who take that vaccine who never respond to it so they're called primary non responders so there is susceptible and you know the reason they added the second shot it wasn't it for a booster the second shot was added to that program around 1992 mop-up set 2 to 10% who never responded in the first place but the problem is that those 2 to 10 percent don't really have that much higher of a chance of responding by yet they have somewhat higher but not a perfect response rate even after that second shot so you know it's a real kind of lack of fault it's a false sense of security that doctors and parents have after vaccines that they are necessarily protected and they're not and even if they do work initially there there's no guarantee that they stay you know is the more back you say for instance the more pertussis vaccines a person gets over their lifetime the shorter they actually respond to it for the shorter period of time so as adults you know our protection might last six months to two years whereas it as a child because they just keep giving more and more and more trying to build that immunity so that's one problem with with this feeling that that vaccines are protected but you mentioned influenza and there's a lot of there's something that a lot of people are unaware of and I think this is a really important point to make about influenza vaccines which is that you're talking about the effectiveness in the year that it's given then the following year there could be a whole three or four new strains of influenza circulating well there's plenty of medical literature and epidemiologic evidence that if you've taken an influenza vaccine on year one that your risk of contracting influenza on year two is higher your risk of getting a pandemic strain is higher and your risk of shedding and spreading to vex the virus for longer periods of time as higher as a result of what that vaccine did to your immune system the year before that's a really important point that I think needs to really be hammered home to people is that even if you are protected that first year that you got the vaccine it has changed your immune system in such a way that your t-cells can't respond using memory response and so you are actually more susceptible than a person who's never been vaccinated and that's been proven in medical literature I speak about this publicly with the references on a regular basis you
1,"Oh our next speaker dr. Russell Blaylock and I can't remember what I didn't know Russell I think I'm known for close to 30 years I met him back sometime in the 1980s and certainly he spent on within the 12 line with netic politics since he's retired from often the practice of medicine he has done probably more to educate people about medicine than anyone I know in fact my wife is down at the Costco just the other day the visible care by Suzanne Somers and the barber picked that book up and looked at it and open it up right to the chapter and pull it the whole chapter about dr. Russell Emma so without further ado Russell thank you very much well I think Stanford inviting me wanted to do this for a long time things always seem to interact and prevent us from coming but I've learned a Norma's amount from the stand he's a brilliant man and he's a tough act to fall of the day service might not be as exciting but I'll try to make a little bit exciting so we can learn bit about vaccinations what they're doing what may be the long-term plan vaccination is I'll touch on that a little bit don't want to make it too controversial I notice that every time conservatives speak is controversial the last speakers mainstream you know it's difficult to ever speak in public as a conservative because you're always by definition controversial one thing I would say about the number seven on that list is surprises to come about John McCain miraculously winning this election one scenario that may happen is this Bly lawsuit and which they're going to prove that he's not a Susie on stages of Susan a Kenyan if that comes about the last minute or even afterwards then suddenly he's out of the running McCain walks in they continue the takeover Station worldwide different model so with that happy ending beginning let's start with the new topic I've seen vaccines have been something that I got into in the last I guess five years maybe a little longer but the more I get into it the more I'm concerned that it is a way to produce a mass loss of health in the United States and what really concerns me is the fact I'm going to make it mandatory you're no longer going to be given the choice and they're scheduling up to 150 vaccines before your lifetime is over so if you're a force to receive 150 vaccines I can guarantee you a great number of diseases are going to increase astronomically we're going to see that the American health deteriorated like you've never seen it before and of course the death rate is going to increase terribly the one of the big concerns you hear a lot about today is autism I just left Pittsburgh speaking to an autistic autism group about a new hypothesis that out proposes a cause of autism called the immuno excite of toxicity hypothesis and I think it explains the entire autism spectrum disorder it explains all the bindings and it also explains all the nerd and journey diseases as well like Alzheimers parks and a disease all these different neurogenic diseases of aging that we're seeing can be explained by the same central mechanism I'll discuss that a little bit but in autism what concern does so much and the medical outliers on call us were outside the mainstream was that about in actually 1980 the incidence of autism suddenly shot up dramatically increase exponentially and it continued to increment at first it was just totally ignored by the medical profession and then it became so overwhelming changing from one in 10,000 babies to one and 150 babies in New Jersey of something like a hundred and eight out one out of every 85 babies is developing autism recently as they took the mercury item most of the childhood vaccines and they thought that suddenly autism was going to disappear or is going to decrease enormously I had worn all the people who put their eggs in the mercury basket up in when you take the mercury out you can find launches and rings I'm going to fall why was the odd man out because everybody said no no you're wrong that's the mercury well they took that most of the mercury out and they'll just break didn't change appreciably in fact it continues to rise well the medical profession has been a little slow to catch on to what's going on unfortunately and our lifetime Stan and myself we've seen a real change in how doctors are trained and what we're seeing is a couple of them one an arrogance that exceeds all Aaron as we've seen in medicine before and that is they're teaching medical students that you are the brightest people on earth medicine is so far advanced you know things that no one else could know and therefore you don't have to listen to your pains because you know what's best and so you no longer interact with your patients and deciding on procedures and treatments you tell them what to do and if they don't do it you tell them to get out of here old and we're seeing that arrogant attitude grow and I deal a lot with this because of the recommendations I've made and I have been appalled at how physicians talk to patients telling them if you don't do this get out of my office telling parents who've already had one on juicing child or even two that if you don't vaccinate your child no longer see you and your own so get out of my own some of the quite a few experience have been intimidated immunizing the second or third child and they became obtuse now there's nothing sadder to see the knack of it it's just the destruction of that child's brain and the destruction of the entire family unit their families no longer have a life it's a very sad thing and to think that they were intimidated by the medical profession by their personal position to destroy their child's life it's just uncomfortable so this is the thing we're against we're trying to convince the medical profession stop propagandizing and start bitching because they're absolutely wrong and they're using the medium just like we see in all this stuff with conservatives they're using the media to propagandize for the vaccine companies in promoting massive vaccination of the public now this is from the Centers for Disease Control site showing how many vaccines are recommended for our Archer this is an enormous number of vaccines and I made up a chart in which I served that by age two years a child receives 36 vaccinations that is an enormous number of activations when I was growing up we had about three or four when my children were small that was about 12 now by age 2 years there's 36 vaccines and as many as 42 by the time that started soon so they are being massively vaccinated with vaccines that enormously powerful as you know we bring destruction now this is not just hypothesis this is hard medical science I do a lot of research looking into the medical literature and have uncovered hundreds and hundreds of studies that show that if you take animals and you vaccinate them in a manner similar to human beings as they're being back to they've now you will produce severe damage to their brain and admirable development on their breath and a lot of this can be irreversible now one of the things is being promoted widely and you see to some TV all the time is that every pregnant woman should received a flu vaccine I cannot think of anything more insane than vaccinating pregnant women and so I did some rather intense research into their what do we know about vaccinating during pregnancy well right now there's a lot of concerns in the field of neurology and neuroscience of the observation that women who develop the flu during the second trimester their pregnancy there's a very high incidence of their child growing up and develop schizophrenia or autism and so that led to this idea well we should vaccinate all pregnant women against the flu well what I discovered in the research was that in fact the virus is not transferred from the mother into the baby's brain so it's not the buyer that's causing the brain change and reduce schizophrenia and ultimately what it is is when the mothers immune system reacts to the virus the immune chemicals called cytokines transfer through into the baby and it's the cytokines the immune reaction of her body that causes the destruction of the baby's brain and the alter development of the baby's brain so in essence the way they test this they took things that stimulate immunity in the pregnant animal with no wires whatsoever no infections organisms just the immune stimulant and found I didn t the same thing so now you're taking in the human population you're saying okay well a small person your women are going to get the flu during the flu season during that second trimester of pregnancy but what we're going to do we're going to stimulate the unity of every pregnant woman so what we're probably going to see in twenty years from now is a tremendous increase in schizophrenia and in autism as that that period dropped now what they're going to do is they we don't know why there's all these cases get your perineum during that 20 years later because no one will think back to say wealthy with that vaccine you gave another 20 years ago even though the research shows that's exactly what you'll do you will produce schizophrenia if you stimulate her and the other thing is that vaccine is there getting the mother's contain to pull those of mercury and so you're vaccinating the mother was mercury now is even worse than that in that that mother will have starting now be vaccinated at age six months net worth is a little baby and they should be vaccinated up to age 24 months and then after that all the way to age 18 so she will be have gotten a huge acuity dose of mercury until the time she gets pregnant and if you get the flu vaccine there is prep so when you put this accumulated neurotoxic dose of mercury plus the effectiveness sequential immune stimulation together you have created a disaster in the making now the question is do they know what I know well a lot better but most of the practicing physicians out there pediatricians they don't know most of the OBGYN doctors that are recommending this vaccines and their patients they don't know what I know they're listening to the American Academy of Pediatrics the American Academy of Family Practice who are telling their members this is something you should do to the health injure of your patient and they don't understand what what I'm telling you right now because they don't research the literature they just the words American having Pediatrics and they are receiving money from the vaccine pharma companies promote these Vedic scenes and that's been proven and this is some of the propaganda that's being put out of the news media and put out the physicians offices assuring them that these stories about dangers of vaccinating pregnant women just are all wrong and completely safe and you can feel safe I'm getting your vaccine to prevent the Pluto well the other interesting thing is the studies show that the flu vaccine most often has no effect on preventing the flu because they get which virus will be predominant for that next year and they go by using the bars previous year you know is last year they were wrong they pick the Roman bars so the vaccine was totally worthless this year and so even at bats if they pick the right bars the effectiveness is about 30 percent so even if the mother is vaccinated she still does a good protection against the flu you get the flu anyway and the mercury suppresses your immunity superglued will be much more intense and then there's a question of what is in a vaccine most people that in a lot of positions you'd be amazed the number of positions you ask them what does that thing they go al there's the bacteria the virus that you want to vaccinate against and then there's a little immune stimulant in there stimulate the unity so they react against those viral enemies they don't know about all these other chemicals in there like formaldehyde special proteins special lipids that are known to be brain toxic that are known to do so don't interview the brain then I wear that they don't know that msg isn't a lot of vaccines monitoring human brain excitotoxin they're not aware what's in the back Dean they're given and that's just the things that you can find the CDC site there seems in a vaccine that most of you are a lot of you probably are not aware of and the thing that concerns me is the number of viruses mycoplasma and viral fragments that are being found in vaccines when they looked at vaccines ransoms the Japanese Eddie look at six major manufacturers of vaccines media which make vaccines the United States population and what they found was that upwards to almost 60% of the vaccines were contaminated either with live viruses or with contaminants now these are viruses and not supposed to be in the bags that you like to pass the box whether downplayed when they found a high percentage of these vaccines were contaminated puzzle box so there well let the virus of cattle and we don't know that it really does anything humans were all accustomed are anything to do something as horses and humans so it does do things in humans that they really don't want you to know now the other thing that they found was viral fragments and with these are little pieces of DNA or RNA but it's not two actually living the virus they found that in a much higher percentage of vaccines and so I read this article and it was by biologists and well-known neurologists and he said well yes as a high percentage of the vaccines are contaminated wild fragments and then the article ended by saying but we don't think causing problem and I'm thinking you're you're inoculated millions of people just in this country and the best you can come up with is I don't think it was also a problem well I looked up what happens when you inject bone fragments and this was actually led a lot of my apotheca well when you exact file fragments they enter the brain and the brain special you cell called the microglia so when it inserts itself in the microglia cell it turns it on and michael yourself becomes real hyperactive and it starts destroying brain cells and brain connections this is the mechanism for dementia and aid you know a certain number of AIDS patients will develop severe dementia become tears of it very quickly well we know that AIDS virus did not invade the brain cells itself so the mystery was always will hide the cause of dementia it's because a fragment of the virus enters the microglia and the microglia become activated secrete very toxic immune chemicals and excitotoxin and begins to destroy brain cells and brain connections and that's I produced the and here we're injecting viral fragments and people with vaccines that have the potential of doing the very same thing but over a slower time period now one of the things that really concerns me it's bad as the contamination problem has been and if we look at the vaccine manufacturers in this country they had some major major scandals of acting contamination I looked up some of the FDA records and the FDA actors were saying that presence of olive oil Salman over them they were accepting plasma and components and people to make vaccines and these people had never been a truly checked for most conditions in other words they had infectious diseases that would be spread by the the vaccine and borrow fragments that can enter design team and so they closed down the plan for a while and then they reopened it well the interesting thing was the FDA never goes bank checks if these vaccines have bio fragments or any life on they take the word of the manufacturer there's no follow-up to see if the vaccines are clean now more concern is that now almost the majority of vaccines made for the world including the United States are made in condiment china and over here the FDA inspects the vaccine companies I use that term loosely inspect the vaccine company every two years in China it's inspected every 13 years now when the FDA goes trying to spec to plan they're not allowed to enter the clinic they have the officials in the plant come out and tell them everything's okay and then that's how they do the inspection once every 13 years so that means now the vaccines probably much more contaminated than ever before and there will be a follow-up by the FDA like a bit but FDA doesn't follow up on domestically produced vaccine they're sure not going to follow up on Chinese made vaccine well you may have noticed that there's been a few scandals in the pharmaceutical industry in China region babies people wasn't my baby formula culture of the contains antifreeze has killed thousands of people worldwide all these scandals have downplayed a lot probably the death rate and the severe injury rate is 10,000 times higher than theirs they're big so the potential if you have these vaccines badly contaminated remember this is the communist country that is sworn to destroy the United States the potential of putting in a microorganism that they generally that they make specifically as a weapon and put it in the vaccine by the time we discovered what had happened you would have a hundred 150 million Americans vaccinated with an agent that you cannot remove from their body so you could wipe out almost two-thirds of population the United States very quickly or you can thicken them so bad they couldn't function as dr. Monte has pointed out the things are not always what we think and if people in this government or once behind the Chinese government doing it as we've seen if you've ever read the issues of Soviet Union you know the Soviet Union was created by money from the United States and from Germany and from the UK so they created the Soviet monster that we spent billions on for said to you they created the Chinese government Chinese communist government we created by imaginations of our governments so there's a interlocking relationship where if you want to carry out what dr. monkeys it's a population control what if your way to do ten days vaccine where you would have sudden epidemic for millions died it would be like the AIDS epidemic gone forever oh this mysterious disease is killing Americans we have no idea why we're investigating in all our major laboratories and by the time anyone would ever get close to discovering what was the actual cause the culprits would clean up all the evidence and of course how you going to trade the evidence before the country goes into enmity and say we would never be able to send the state agencies to Communist China to discover these things now there's a lot of complications of vaccines that are rarely talked about in fact when I spoke at a meeting of autistic parents and one of the parents told me she went your pediatrician he told her he thought I just got off the phone with the CDC and they said that they have never seen a seizure caused by vaccine when I told her I said well number one I can tell you that he never called the CDC he went back there and drank a cup of coffee came out and told you you did because the CDC them their own cycle is that their vaccines cause seizures so we know that our seizures was a major problem with the DPT vaccine it produces seizures and a very high percentage of children we know that when you combine vaccines the incidence of seizures goes up considerably and that these seizures may even be delayed months or years after the vaccine doesn't have to happen within the first week or so the vaccine and then other things the SIDS that I was talking to the group in Pittsburgh about Sue's stuff and they were saying that you know my profession still denies it has a they who's nineteen seventy percent of all that fall within two weeks of getting it VPP vector so that's a pretty good indicator that there may be a problem with this vaccine now if you look at the mechanism which goes along with my hypothesis of every other side of toxicity its activation of these microglia in the brain that destroy these brain areas or make them not work properly well the part of the brain that contains the highest concentrations microglia and then the brain city car brain control respiration so when you take a small baby and you inject it with this powerful vaccine and activate microglia they begin to secrete these inflammatory excitotoxins and cytokines in that part of the brain is not as a big surprise in a small percentage you can produce sudden infant death so in my rather extensive investigation into SIDS death I think it is a vaccine triggered death due to this this mechanism and the other thing that people don't seem to realize is the danger giving live vaccine viruses like an MMR composable I measles rubella mumps virus they think we know about these three viruses is that their their immune suppressing bar just like the the HIV virus he in suppress immune system in four weeks or even months and in the suppression immune system it can be so profound that did the child become susceptible to other infections so a lot of things like the mapa thing Windham enjoy us they killed these little children is because we got an MMR vaccine it suppress their immunity then they exposed to the amount with influenza bacteria and it ain't resist him logically so they end up hitting severe anxiety because we have mice normal children expose that the model attempt one the bacteria develop their disease their problem or if they happen to be the very model and get over to them a small percentage that you develop does that need they're insisting surprise well a good way to suppress is and gentlemen and MMR vaccine and the other thing is we know that when you inject live viruses and people and a certain things there's people that buyers who live for the rest of their life in your body and they did a study on elderly people and looking for measles virus and their juices and what they found if you look at their brain twenty percent of the brain and live needles arson and if you look there are other mortgage about 45 percent and work loud needles viruses now when you make a live vaccine what you do is you insinuate that the buyer so it won't cause measles that's the whole idea is you take this virus and you run it through tissue cultures into the virus loses its ability to produce the measles building you call that an e weighted virus and you inject it in the person hopefully an immune reaction and development resistance well the problem and this is this custom of biology literature is that when this virus enters your body and it doesn't die but comfortable we call a persistent virus and grows there for decades because your body is producing free radicals all the time particularly you get healed from something else those free radicals bomb bar that bars is DNA and it attenuates back to a bully pathogen back on Mars and he introduced new disease and that's why we know there's a correlation tree measles vaccinations and things like Crohn's disease and even moles corrosive so injecting live viruses the very hazardous thing to do particularly in small babies whose immune system is not fully functional yet but cue it those babies are not breastfed because babies get their immunity for the first year from their mother they don't have the ability to resist infections if the mother's bottle being the baked immunity is totally normal to every disease and this is why again a lot of babies end meningitis needs other things that they screen we need back things or because they're not breastfeeding they're not transferring their maternal antibodies to the baby to protect the baby you should breastfeed at least for a year to two years and we know there's a lot of the diseases you may have heard there's a tremendous increase in a see a tremendous increase in diabetes the type 1 diabetes in children and in rheumatoid arthritis in children there's all vaccine related disorder and you look through the literature and the scientific literature is shows to be that's what happens is that the asthma rate increases enormous we was vaccinated with certified certain types of vaccine well we're seeing an explosion of asthma today and those of us practicing medicine a long time as my children used to be a rather benign disease they rarely ever done that now is the fatal disease of children so it's much more severe and Angele more common and it continues the increase in incidence is positive directly related to this vaccination obsession the type 1 diabetes the same thing diabetes is strongly correlated to certain types of see if they're here you have a normal child they're vaccinated the developed type 1 diabetes you shorten their life span you've increased the amount of money that is parents are going to spend taking care the child becomes this terrible disease taken by bees all produced by the vaccine and we know that's because if you produce antibodies to your own language and some of these vaccines now the live polio vaccine I think probably a lot of you heard about this before t infection this was a contaminant all the forms with vaccine up until nineteen sediment both live virus and kill fire site polio vaccine this vaccine is contaminated with the virus called entity for the simians rs40 this virus was known to produce cancer in M particularly sarcomas and brain tumors while they denied it forever when it first came out that these vaccines were contaminated and they had contaminated millions of children with this virus at first they went to the denial mind that this is not known to be a fancy coffee virus well then it was proven by a scientist from the NIH say B it does cause cancer and that the types of cancer introduced four camps as you can see in human beings well the studies continue and when the government always does these suspicions of a connection to some program they're promoting they always hear what's called epidemiologic study it just always be behind them what that does is they look at a large population of people and say well RIT people were injected with a polio virus and we'll all of them achieve their cancer rate increases and then they write papers that we saw no increase in cancer rate of people has been injected with the virus well when you look back at the studies of the lungs plausible people moving in and out of it the area that they were setting people that had taken the virus that they weren't recorded so it really was a worthless study but the advantage of doing epidemiologic studies is you can make it tell you anything you want to and in the scientific world that long haul we know that they won that the weakest typesetting is everything Elijah said every government study in FD life stuff that's was a different mercury bad things such as the exact things inside if they did magic epidemiologic studies and we're saving clothes all the factors so they could come back and say well we studied 335 thousand children we found no connection between the vaccine or the Marisol and the autism sortable and then when people that were experts in statistics look at their articles and say well you know you this art study sort of respected well that never gets into the media will get that to the media's original story Instagram as the huge study shows no connect Street vaccines mulches and that no further study should be done that was the shot when the history mountains that no further studies ever need to be done now there is nothing in science and completely medical science in which you would ever make such a stupid statement nothing has ever suddenly everything can change later that you learn wars are methods of research approval he can change so that if you find well we were wrong twenty years ago but for the first time they come out they no further money needs to be spelled this we don't even look at it anymore and I hear that quoted constantly like a did a radio interview recently where we had a person who was talking about the vaccines and they had one of their doctors come on is that all this is all nonsense we do stop spending money on this one doesn't abuse a stop at the end and so they as we come on the radio after he spoke and I just destroy your thing itself and that's what you have to do you can let's get away to the Sun sense because it they'll do it and these poor parents will to see kids are the victims of this is tactic as a couple of tumors that are linked this is one is mesothelioma well you hear mesothelioma is caused by asbestos there's a physician who is a biologist beard famous neurologist he did a lot less important and he showed that in fact men number one cause a test before you buy probably from all these polio biases that were given now asbestos exposure increases the risk if you have the virus but if you don't have the virus that risk of getting mesothelioma jism asbestos is extremely low that's which are the cases have been infected that before you Box jelly's brain tumors particularly menuhim blastoma childrens the big killer small children very colleague lincoln children they cultured these tumors in a significant number of children and found they always noting this before tomorrow and so then the government comes back and said well we think that was just a perchance infection these really anything to do with reducing the Malaysians well doctor any of the National Institutes of Health and proven it is the Carson's a virus and this the biologists Harmonia looked at it and he said well I'll type the bars and it will look outside around the tumor to see if the virus and histograms to well it was only in the tumor which proved this virus cause the truth the big surprise was that it's still causing this highly malignant tumor in children and the question was well how is it causing it if the virus was removed in 1970 the vaccine so the new vaccines are clear of as important well it is what we call it vertically transmitted virus that is it passes from parent to child and then from that child to the next generation so every generation was infected by that virus we'll pass it on to the next generation so that means from now on children were to get this horrible tumor due to due to the induction by sv40 virus contamination coding environment now another thing that's interesting about the polio virus was the use of the live oral vaccine they discovered that in fact after 1970 every case of polio was caused by the vaccine son and not by a while bars now they took the by the Turkish oral live virus and they brought it to Africa they were going to radical polio in Africa and that jury is one of the places they chose they start getting this far assume suddenly the mothers are coming down slowly on the children are coming down with polio and they start an epidemic opponent and they they even call it back being related polio some their names new form of polio well the mother's wise up and they were hiding in the bush she keeps getting a vaccine they do it with caution well the government United States government compressional Nigeria that you've got to make sure they take is back pain because and this is not World Health our Loretta said well it hit the virus vaccine calls the epidemic of polio but now that we caused it we can't stop because there's a cheap spread and they come to the United States so we need to keep back to men so what they did since the the they try to get a Nigerian government to corporate well they wouldn't first cuz they were too afraid of revolution and so they went to the surrounding countries and they tell them how you know Nigeria is bringing polio in your country unless you make them vaccinate their children so the surrounding countries threatened to declare war Nigeria if they didn't vaccinate their children and so the Government of Nigeria that if you don't back you make sure puts in prison and so a lot of mothers were arrested and put in prison their children and typing away forcibly documented well that's what's going to happen this country when they may be mandatory nineteen's you need to vaccinate them when you go to prison they take a child and they are forcibly document if you review those and force we vaccinate you so here's an example of an epidemic started in Africa by a live virus they do all the interviews which to the killed virus which in this country you don't use the the killed butter I mean a lot of box as you get the law now you only kill them so these are slightly I'll try to state that document II was talking about and these are just distributions of the highly contaminated vaccines with Esme 40mm in the lower 48 a state that had low contamination of the vaccine so it period this is dr. Boyd Haley he's done a lot on a mercury oxygen to the brain and I've spent quite a bit of time talking with you about this as a total amount of it I think tha"
1,"hi this is dr. Mercola for most of you viewing this is winter and associated with the winter of course is the flu season and more than likely you're being exposed to significant pressure in the media and your community to get your flu shot in fact when I visit with our airport last week there they were even offering flu shots at O'Hare so I'm sure you're being exposed to it through many of the communities in the buildings that you that you're visiting and part of the reason is because the drug companies that make this and been able to convince and really manipulate the public health community to convince them this is a public health crisis why because more than a million people get the flu every year and of those about a half a million at least are hospitalized and from those half of half a million hospitalizations about 35,000 people die every year from the year from the flu or so we're told if you examine very carefully the CDC statistics that 35,000 people mostly do not die from the flu they die from pneumonia and in fact the numbers show that less than a thousand people a year die from the flu the rest are dying from pneumonia so the question becomes does flu vaccine work and even in the million people who do get the flu and and are affected by it how old are these individuals well these individuals are mostly elderly that's when your immune system becomes diminished especially as you is if you've not adopted these healthy lifestyles so and those are the individuals are more likely to suffer from pneumonia so does the flu vaccine work for pneumonia no it's conclusively been shown in multiple studies not to or not to work and I've got a list in some of these studies there's one published in the New England Journal of Medicine in nineteen or 2005 three years ago and one just recently published in The Lancet showed that flu vaccine does not work for pneumonia no surprise but it also doesn't work for the flu in fact I challenge anyone to find a study that proves a well done well research trial to choose that improves the flu vaccine works for anyone it doesn't work so if it didn't work then you're only really if there was no problems with you're only out the inconvenience and the cost to get the flu the flu shot but unfortunately that's not the case because the flu vaccine is loaded with with toxins that you just do not want to put in your system the first one and then innocent the majority of flu vaccines is mercury yes they're putting mercury in the form of thimerosal and about 25 micrograms and if you look at the warning size of mercury that exceeds the toxic dose of mercury that is not recommended by the EPA and the CDC unless you're over 550 pounds yet it's in ever nearly every dose of flu vaccine now there's also other things such as phenol aluminum ethylene glycol which is antifreeze and a variety of other substances should you just do not want to do not want to put in your body so the craziness of this is actually the flu vaccine is recommended for every single person in the US or nearly every single person because it was in 2005 three years ago the Federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that infants from the age of six months to five years old be given a flu vaccine every year and earlier this year they extended that for all trilled children so just about every single person in the u.s. is recommended to get an annual flu vaccine so obviously I do not advise you in fact I strongly encourage you to review the evidence make your own decision and I suspect if you carefully review the literature you'll reach the same conclusion I did which is that it is unwise for you or anyone in your family to receive the flu shot so there are things that you can do to prevent the flu now wouldn't that be better prevention makes a lot more sense clearly you would like to lead the take control of your health lifestyle program which involves of course normalizing your insulin and doing exercise and all the things that I talked about but there are specific things that will really virtually annihilate the flu and one has been clearly without any question is vitamin D and the best way to get vitamin D is through sun exposure unfortunately is an isn't it interesting coincidence that the flu occurs in the winter so that's when you don't have access to appropriate amounts of sunshine so the next best thing ideally would be to expose your skin to ultraviolet radiation that you can do that with a safe tanning bed in a safe tanning bed there are there's a list on my site where you can go and find these commercially available or for more convenience you can actually get one to use in your home for you and your family I think that's the best way because there's very little danger of overdosing on vitamin D but for whatever reason you are unable to do that or you can't do that then the next best step is to make sure that you and your family members are getting enough oral vitamin D and what is the dose well the dose is a lot higher than you're being told the dose probably is about 2,000 units international units a day for children and up to between somewhere between five and ten thousand units a day for adults if you are a heavy adult closer 300 pounds then you're going to be closer to the ten thousand units and most most normal way to delts will be close to four or five thousand use so if you take that every day the odds of you obtaining a flu are virtually non-existent now of course a safer way to get that is with the sunlight exposure or the UV light exposure through a safe tanning bed now if you do take the the supplements ideally would be best to have your blood checked it is in appearance if you're going to go through the the difficulty in the challenge of getting that you want to make sure at this point in time that you get that done through LabCorp not quest I've done the earlier video on that explains the problems with quests at this point in time so give it through lab core and your levels should be over 50 nanograms per milliliter now interestingly if you're watching this video when it's too late you or someone you know already has a flu there is something you can do you can actually use oral vitamin D in very large doses let me tell you what that dose is the dose is 2,000 international units of vitamin D per kilogram of body weight so that basically you would divide your weight if you know your weight in pounds by 2.2 to obtain your weight in kilograms and you multiply it by 2,000 to obtain your vitamin D dough so essentially it's almost a thousand units per pound of body weight very close a little more precise if you use that formula so if you weigh 200 pounds you're going to require 200,000 units okay a hundred pounds will require 100,000 units and that's taken as one dose every day for three days and if you take it early in the course of the illness that usually is enough to abort the actual illness so hopefully this information will give you that the knowledge you will need to make an informed decision for yourself and your family your friends so that you will have hard data to in options as we enter the flu season you"
1,last time we talked we talked about vaccines and autism and I think just this week a new report came out saying the incidence of autism are increasing and which 45 yeah which happens every year I mean yeah that's the worst we've seen right 45 right on the charts we're headed for the 1 & 2 by 2032 according he just extend the numbers but but when those numbers come out the doctors or the health officials say it's alarming but we're not really sure they always try to say oh well we're just report we're just reporting more we're just diagnosing more witches I think absolutely not the case I actually think we might be diagnosing less because when you think about it in the school system it's a tremendous burden once you say a child has autism you're obligated to treat them with very special treatment that requires a lot more money and I think all the schools are going to become really burdened probably already are by the cost of all these extra autistic children and of teaching them it just amazes me that people think there isn't actually more when i think about my childhood i never met an autistic person in my child in my entire childhood i have an autistic child just down the street from me in my home and you know people at work i know people at work with autistic children i mean it's just amazing to me that it's so pervasive and that we're so somehow immune to the alarm I don't understand why there aren't more people like myself who are absolutely terrified of the future given the way this thing is going it puzzles me that people are just going about businesses if everything's fine but there's such a campaign to say it's not vaccines what do we know about the connection possibly between vaccines and autism right now right I mean of course the government has done a really good job of suppressing the information that's out there and there's been quite a bit written on the aluminum in particular which is one that I've focused on aluminum is definitely neurotoxin of course mercury is too they claim they took the mercury out and autism rates continue to go up and therefore it's not the mercury it's not that simple because as they took out the mercury they were also increasing the amount of aluminum in the vaccines which would compensate for that so you're just substituting one chemical for another and of course glyphosate was going up rapidly at that time in the food glyphosate is the active ingredient in roundup I think there is tremendous synergistic toxicity between the toxic chemicals in the food and the toxic chemicals in the vikes vaccines and I think that this is why vaccines have become much more toxic today than they used to be because of this synergy you
1,one thing you mentioned is and in one of your taxes there's new adjuvants that are coming out and you mentioned Illumina most was one of those things that's currently being used what are the new ones and what might be some of the concerns down the road with them well squalene is is one that's already been used that was perhaps the biggest one of the biggest part of the problem the problems with Gulf War Syndrome okay a lot of Gulf War vets that went into the Gulf War they got this cocktail of vaccines and some of those vaccines like for example for anthrax contains squalene which is an adjuvant like aluminum it's added to the vaccine to to increase antibody production and that's a problem and then they have a new generation of of adjuvant that are coming on to the market and I talk about those in my other book in the vaccine safety manual and here there's a section in there where I do talk about some of the other adjuvant this is the new generation of vaccines the the a so4 and MF 53 these are these are fancy names that that sort of hide what they are but part of the problem is that the immune system has a hard time these are oil in emulsion adjuvant and the immune system has a hard time differentiating these adjuvant s-- from something that is part of the body versus something that is foreign to the body and and that's a big part of the the autoimmunity by the way it's the same as with aluminum when they when the aluminum is put into the body it irritates the body and the scientists that have invented this were able to create a neat technical trick which is to produce to put something into the body that that were to inject something into the body the aluminum for example with the a or any of these other new adjuvant that that increases antibody production but what happens is you turn the immune system on and there's no way to turn it off once you've added these adjectives into the system you can't turn down the immune system and that's essentially what autoimmunity is the the immune system becomes exhausted by by constantly fighting this for what it believes is a foreign substance in the body and and now they've got there's research now that's showing that actually the smallest particles maybe the worst okay the smaller the smaller the concentration of aluminum were the smaller the concentration of these other new generation adjuvants may actually cause more damage because it is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier you
1,"let's talk about kids a little bit more in something that you go back to when they're just born in first couple of years and they get loaded with vaccines and the amount that they get is I'm sure more than double then when you and I were kids why is that increased so much and what is that doing to a a newborn through six year old that gets that amount of vaccines well this is a gigantic can of worms the whole vaccination topic is wide and deep and there's a lot of information here now honestly this particular topic isn't my wheelhouse I'll tell you whose wheelhouse it is dr. sherry Tenpenny she's an osteopath out of Columbus Ohio I believe she's the person that you should be talking to about this because this is her wheelhouse this is her area of specialty right but what I can tell you is I have a 26 year old son he wasn't vaccinated I'm not an advocate of vaccinations why because from my point of view the net negative benefits of vaccinations outweigh the positive benefits of vaccination quite frankly which are questionable now it's a very complicated sophisticated subject but my position on vaccinations is the parameters that the MDS use to measure the effectiveness of vaccinations are incomplete and they're leaning on one particular set of data and not looking at all these other data sets and because they're not holistic in their understanding of the effects of vaccination good or bad their results have a built-in bias and they're skewed before it before the fact it's called a priori bias so from my point of view vaccination science is fuzzy science it's fuzzy science you know I'm not against vaccinations because I'm a natural doctor that's nonsense right I mean I can prescribe drugs and by the way this is another interesting thing to talk about when people talk about natural medicine everybody is confused about that nobody knows what that means most people think oh those nature paths they only use natural treatments well no we don't I mean soap is not a naturally occurring substance right you have to make soap you don't find it growing from trees every single homeopathic medicine that's ever been made is non naturally occurring thing it's you have to manipulate the original substance chemically if you give an herbal tincture you have to manipulate the stuff that you pull off the plant chemically if you use a synthetic vitamin right you've manipulated a molecule and it's a misconception that holistic physicians or nature Pathak physicians only use natural medicines whatever that means it's not it at all the fundamental tenant of nature Pathak medicine is the human body has a built-in god-given natural ability to fix itself and it's this natural ability that the human body is endowed with to optimize its structure and function that nature Pathak doctors support and we use the scientific method to do it so if we want to support and promote healthy blood sugars we use the scientific method to prove that our methodology is correct and then we try that methodology clinically to see that in fact is effective and this is why I'm such a cheerleader for dr. Wallach because dr. Wallach was in charge of 25 million dollars of federally funded research from 1970 to 1982 25,000 autopsies over ten million blood chemistry's in histopathology that's a lot of pragmatic old-fashioned boots-on-the-ground research when you do that much research you start to get a clue and that's why in my opinion dr. Wallach is the leading holistic physician in the world why because he did the hard homework years ago and all of his therapeutics and subsequent clinical experience were based upon a pragmatic fundamental really good really sound scientific research and when you use scientific research to support the natural god-given ability of the human body to fix itself the results you get you wouldn't believe the things I've seen people recover from you"
-1,"Hi my name is Jai and recently I came to the 
 hospital to get a vaccination. Vaccines help   our bodies to fight different diseases. Dad and 
 I went to the Immunisation Clinic at the Royal   Children's Hospital. Immunisation is another 
 word for vaccination and this time I had my   flu vaccination. When the nurse, Sonia, was 
 ready we went into a little room. Sonia asked   my dad some questions to make sure I was ready 
 and well enough to have my vaccination. Then   Sonia told me about the different ways 
 I could help during my vaccination. Some   kids choose to buy some bubbles and others use 
 a special gadget called a Buzzy. Buzzy tickles   your skin so you can't feel things as much. I 
 give it a try and it buzzes against my skin. When babies have their vaccinations they can 
 have a special medicine called Sucrose to   help. Babies usually have their vaccinations 
 in their legs but my vaccination went into   my arm. Sometimes you might need more than 
 one vaccination at the same time and some   vaccinations you can swallow. I rolled up my 
 sleeve and then it was time to start. For my   vaccinations I chose to hold Dad's hand and 
 look away. I kept my arm still and relaxed   and it was done in a flash. It prickled for a 
 few seconds but it didn't let it bother me. My   arm was a little bit sore for a day or so but 
 it's great to know that I'm protected against   the flu now. Then she gave me a special sticker 
 to wear. The sticker had my vaccination time on   it. Sonia wrote it down on my chart so we can 
 remember when I had it and she gave dad some   information about the medicine and then after 
 our 15-minute wait we went home. Vaccinations   are the best way to stop certain diseases from 
 making us sick. Have you had your vaccinations?"
1,"we respect the atom bomb but how many of us respect this this dish full of disease producing organisms if allowed to grow unchecked may be capable of more widespread loss of life than a dozen atom bombs but scientists have found a strong defense vaccines which stimulate the formation of antibodies once formed they may remain in the blood and confer immunity against another attack of the same disease I was taught in medical school that vaccines are safe and they're effective I had no reason to believe otherwise it wasn't until the New York State passing of the hepatitis B mandate in 1991 and struck me as kind of odd that they were mandating a vaccine for newborn babies when babies were not at risk for developing hepatitis B infection it made me question whether or not we're doing a service to children by giving them all these vaccines and injections there's more than just an assumption that vaccines are safe it is pretty much regarded as law but I don't think it's that black and white there are many greys and you have more and more people who are questioning it and with good reason because the science is not there to really state that vaccines are truly safe my wife is five months pregnant and I'm for parental rights not government coercion telling us what we can do what we can't do with our kids there is no other mandated procedure and our that is first of all it's illegal we can't have you can't make you can't make people do procedure that they don't want the parents have to be the ones to make decisions for what's best for Mike for our kids it can't be the government saying that it's against the nuremberg laws it's ridiculous since against the state constitution and it's against their own bylaws here I mean I was reading the I've been reading some legislation that was passed years ago but these two do state sterilizations they thought that that was a good thing you know so you can't let the state make the decisions the people have to decide and parents have to decide and that's why I'm here they've gone from when you and I were kids we had like eight shots now that's up to 70 shots and multi shots and then I'll tell you the safety of these things there is no there's no efficacy stuff in the toxicity of these things we're having more and more side-effects you're having more more autism when you go from autism which was unheard of in America in 1932 was one in 5,000 after she'd started being preserved with Mercury which is the second most toxic thing on this planet next to plutonium and then you go to let's go up a couple of decades by 1990 it was one in 200 now it's one in 88 now truthfully it's true that a lot of autism rates are grouped into one but there is something that's really happening and one of the most vulnerable things you can do to a child who doesn't have an immune system is give them a shot and I'll just give you one example you take the hepatitis B okay the hepatitis you're only going to get that from drug use and you're going to get that from intravenous drug use and gain from sexual contact and yet they won't let a baby out of the hospital unless insisting on getting the shot I'm sorry there's an unnecessary shot that they don't need to have when especially one of the babies immune system isn't developed the baby's immune system is the mother's immune system so it is beyond ridiculous it's criminal government can't make decisions on what I do to my body my children's body that they had to stay out of that that's not something that's open for discussion I got to make my choice and I'm going to do what's best for my child and to the idea that they're going to mandate that you if I don't want to vaccinate my kid they can't go to school unless they get a consent from a doctor that's the lunacy show them the thimerosal dong which we keep in a metal container because we're little frayed of it and it's a very fine powder this is this is thimerosal which is labeled very toxic as cumulative effects can cause damage to the kidneys to the respiratory system skin to the nervous system specifically warns on here that it can cause reproductive and developmental toxicity meaning that it can cause things like autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders this is immensely toxic stuff and this is what's in the vaccine it's important to realize we're talking about a whole range of products vaccines are a big one because of course you're directly injecting it for example this is tetanus vaccine this one expires it's a lot dated now in 2007 here's the thimerosal one to ten thousand is a preservative perhaps the the biggest one in the u.s. at least that's exposure to mercury is the influenza vaccine influenza vaccine is now recommended for all pregnant women all infants all children on a yearly basis you suppose that lashes influence me understand that thimerosal is not added at the end it's not like well that factory next year can make thimerosal free thimerosal you either have to have a thimerosal free factory or you have to not have one they add thimerosal at each step because the factory is not clean and not sterile so you either have to have an expensive sterile factory where you don't need thimerosal all you have to have one that produces thimerosal it's gonna need thimerosal or something the whole time it needs to be stopped this is the influenza vaccine from adventist pastor their flu zone by Marisol 25 micrograms of mercury per dose I'd like to point out that a lot of people didn't know and I'm one of them I've given two thousand rhogam shots I've been in vaccines for 35 years I didn't know that rhogam had thimerosal in it so I think a lot of the doctor were unaware they were unaware that even the word thimerosal meant mercury he had been this bright or cautious baby speaking of full sentences by the age of two after that shot we got the diagnosis that he was minimally brain-damaged and the recommendation was to put him in a self-contained classroom for the learning disabled I became committed to reforming the mass vaccination system and I've worked for thirty years to make vaccine policies safer in the 1980's the children were being asked to get 23 doses of seven vaccines in the last three decades that number has grown to 69 doses of 16 vaccines that's triple the numbers of doses of vaccines we gave our children in the early 1980s rates of autism are jumping an alarming 10 to 17 percent every year every 20 minutes in this country another child is diagnosed with autism all you have to do is ask the guidance counselors the teachers the principals and all of them across the board will tell you that we are seeing a rise in the number of children with disabilities that is clear the CDC states that one in hundred ten children have autism but autism is just one piece of a bigger problem the bigger issue is that one in six kids in this country has some form of neurodevelopmental disability fifty years ago children didn't even get type-2 diabetes now it's an emerging epidemic as our a long list of ailments which used to be rare and have now been mainstreamed things like asthma and autism an acid reflux and arthritis allergies adult acne attention deficit disorder and that's just the A's vaccine safety is not just about autism autism is only one kind of brain and immune dysfunction that is associated with vaccination millions and millions of children now in America are chronically ill and disabled and during the same time period that the numbers of doses of vaccines have more than tripled that we're giving our children we have seen this explosion of chronic disease and disability and to take off the table the use of a pharmaceutical product like a vaccine as a potential cofactor in this explosion of chronic disease and disability among our children is irresponsible yes if we talk about the children who have learning disabilities who weren't born that way but who have learning disabilities if we talk about the children who develop ad D attention deficit disorder if we talk about the children who have P D D the pervasive developmental disorder Asperger's every kind of disease process that you can talk about that has this neurologic learning problem when we add those children into the mix and I believe firmly that they should be added that they are all on one spectrum and it's one process you're talking about one child in every six and those numbers were not like that you will talk to teacher after teacher who's been in this business of teaching children for 30 years and they will all tell you it wasn't like that when I started teaching it's like that now and something has changed and they laugh the teachers laugh when a physician says oh it's just better diagnosis they were all there before I can promise you that if you had had this many children walking through grocery stores having full-on meltdown temper tantrums 30 years ago it would have been diagnosed as autism so about 10 years ago a mother came up to me and said hey Doc did you know there's mercury in vaccines and I hadn't a clue and so my question was well if mercury is in the vaccines what else is in the vaccines so I open up the package inserts and I see mercury and aluminum and formaldehyde and antibiotics and then preservatives like polysorbate 80 so I asked the pediatric resident I said tell me how does the body process those materials she could not answer me and no one in science can because no one has looked Health Canada says the best way to avoid the flu is vaccination which in many provinces is free well let's see if these recent flu shot recipients can help reveal the mystery of why cheetos and pop-tarts list their ingredients while vaccines do their best not to are you aware of the ingredients in the vaccine I know there's some egg products I don't think they offered us a list of ingredients though that no I don't know this is blind faith for me did you know that there's a mercury in that shot no I didn't oh I did not know are you glad that is free yes well you know it's not really free yes well that's paying for through our taxes right so if I sneeze right now would you be okay with that you know these people confirm two things some are happy to wait in line for a secret serum and nobody likes getting sneezed on well what if drug companies are right what if tricking your body into thinking it's already sick doesn't make you sick what if there's not enough vaccine to go around you should know that making your own is easier than brewing your own beer and it could save your life well the first thing you need is a live virus no is there anyone here suffering from the flu oh sure would you favor us by discharging directly under these chicken embryos uh I could good huh we now have our chicken embryos and our live virus now from the pickled frog chart your local schools biology class will keep that virus dead like the drug companies do with formaldehyde now careful don't get any frog in the mix that'd be gross now let's add a little either careful don't fall asleep and then we dump some detergent in there that keeps it clean and remember when your mother lost her mind when you played with mercury because it never leaves your body well that makes it a great preservative if you have a thermometer well staying healthy is a lot more important than room temperature now all of this goes into the centrifuge like this blender and hey hey hey it's vaccine for the whole family well the debate over whether vaccines usually don't work or aren't fully safe may never end which at least explains why the contents are rarely publicized ah fine I'm fine but it's government recommended oh well that's my eye on the flu shot you would think that the FDA would take each of those ingredients and study them and in human infants to make sure that each of though each of those ingredients are safe well they haven't done that they've never taken vaccine quantities of each of those ingredients and done any sort of safety testing to confirm that each one of those ingredients are safe I'm a neuroscientist by training and my studies are in the origin of neurological disease I develop animal models of Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's disease recently we've been looking at aluminum which is common to many vaccines it's used as an adjuvant that means helper without the aluminum the vaccine basically does not provide any long-term protection and some of my research has looked at injectable vex and how it might impact the nervous system the difference between injectable aluminum versus dietary aluminum is that aluminum that you eat is excreted fairly rapidly injectable aluminum however is meant to stick around and that's precisely why it's there in the first place that's what an adjuvant does so we simply did the really simple experiment of taking the same stuff out of the vaccines the aluminum hydroxide and injecting it into mice into the muscles to see what would happen if we tried to mimic the vaccine schedule we are quite surprised to see how rapidly the behavioral symptoms emerged they showed not only behavioral deficits motor function but they ultimately showed cognitive deficits as well and once we sacrifice the animals and started looking inside their brains and spinal cords we found massive damage to motor neurons and so we may be creating the conditions for Parkinson's disease Lou Gehrig's disease Alzheimer's disease maybe not immediately but maybe 20 30 40 years down down the road when I first saw her she was having problems with seizures intractable headaches chest pains and I found out that she began having problems following the herd Gardasil vaccinations in my opinion there's little room for doubt concerning that this condition was caused by the Gardasil G every time she got a another injection she got worse and worse I think Gardasil should be taken off the market it hasn't been a well tested before it was placed in the general public the FDA has a particular process that's called fast tracking when there is a promising drug that comes forward Gardasil they had scheduled a four year trial but after 15 months they went to the FDA and said there is nothing like this vaccine on the market would you please consider this for fast-track the FDA said yes so within six months they approved it and as soon as they hadn't approved Merck said we will no longer continue our trial we're gonna stop our trial because our drug is now approved he is an example of why no vaccine particular vaccine for children should ever be fast-tracked by the FDA less than 1% of all cancer deaths are for cervical cancer and yet we now have a vaccine that was only studied in 1200 girls under the age of 16 before it was recommended for universal use by the CDC in all 11 and 12 year old girls in this country that's not science that's politics Texas Governor Rick Perry has ordered that school girls in his state must get the Gardasil shot it's also worth pointing out that the AP says that Governor Perry has ties to Merck including the fact that one of the company's lobbyists in the state of Texas is his former chief of staff we are standing publicly for the legal right to follow our conscience when making educated vaccine decisions for our families if the state can force you to put your life on the line or your child's life on the line for any medical intervention then the state has too much power more than 2,000 Prince George's County students have not gotten their state mandated shots tonight and ultimatum to some of those parents come to court get the shots or else more than 1600 students and their parents have been ordered to appear in Circuit Court for the children to be immunized we can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way but it's gonna have to get done I went over there and saw the parents lining up they had police with dogs and guns patrolling the courthouse I thought to myself there is something wrong with us we shouldn't be summoning appearance on the threat of imprisonment and fines because they didn't get their children a hepatitis B vaccination or a chicken pox vaccination Americans are well aware that a number of prescription drugs that have been licensed as safe have been found to be unsafe after they're used by millions of people and yet when it comes to vaccines which are mandated by law there's somehow this separation made the vaccines couldn't possibly be the same the majority of vaccine research is paid for by the vaccine manufacturers themselves so the people who are approving the vaccines are taking the word of the pharmaceutical companies the pharmaceutical companies have been allowed to be to present at the table at the FDA and the CDC and I think a firewall needs to be built between those in government who are regulating making policy for and developing vaccines and those pharmaceutical companies that are making profit off the sale of vaccines you know snowonder parents are asking questions it's because doctors that are making these policies are financially benefitting from these policies the ACIP is the organization that approves vaccine policy for the United States you have some doctors on that board that have a direct financial interest in these vaccines that's a huge conflict of interest do you believe anybody who's getting funds from Merck or any of the other pharmaceutical companies should be on advisory panels that are making judgments about pharmaceuticals coming from those companies or do you believe that's a conflict of interest I think that's a difficult question to answer wait a minute let me get this straight you think it's a difficult question to answer if somebody is getting funding of some type from a pharmaceutical company for them to sit on an advisory panel that's approving or giving their approval to a new drug that's coming on the market you don't see that as a conflict it's important to point out that recommendations for vaccinations are made independently by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians and those recommendations are virtually always in harmony with the recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices the pharmaceutical industry is probably the most powerful lobbying force in Washington DC there are 535 members of Congress the House and the Senate there are over 600 lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry they are a very powerful force they give a lot of money to both political parties they give a lot of money to individual candidates they don't give me any but they give an awful lot of money to various candidates and they have a very strong lobbying effort and so getting anything done in Congress that Pharma the the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want done is very very difficult that is one of the problems the other problem is they have very very strong influence with the Food and Drug Administration and Health and Human Services and CDC and because of their their strength it's very difficult to to get change me I mean we're talking today about autism but there's something in even or as great at stake here as the autism question and whether or not the MMR vaccine and other vaccines may be contributing daunt ISM and that is are we letting pharmaceutical companies have too great an influence on the decision making process that affects every one of our lives do we want to give at a child nine vaccinations in one day do we want to give them 31 or 32 or 33 vaccinations between the time they're born and their age six isn't that maybe a little bit overload I ended up taking him to my pediatrician she just said oh he's autistic that's how it goes sometimes you know they're born that way but we felt like there was something medically going on with him so we took him to this doctor and he said the first thing I want to do is check him for heavy metals I looked at those results and the mercury was off the end of the page I sort of freaked out I thought he's mercury poison where did that mercury come from we tested the paint we tested the air I'd had the sawdust in my basement shop tested to see is there mercury in that when we talked to dr. green about it tell me what we were doing he said you don't have to look for where the mercury is coming from we know where it's coming from it's in the vaccines that Jordans and getting money guys since I began practicing in 1975 I saw one child with autism in the 80s one child with autism the early 90s and then in the late 90s I was literally flooded with patients I've evaluated and treated note approximately 2100 patients with autism the children who are here their parents will tell you were definitely injured by vaccines they were fine and then they were gone so if I have pants screaming and I have science confirming that there's a problem with exposure to mercury and there's a problem with exposure to aluminum and there's a problem when you take a broken immune system and give it three live viruses on the same day then why don't we just want to fix that this is it's ridiculous that there are this many children in one little town in one of the pool all of them who have the same story Jordan received a mercury far exceeding EPA safety guidelines we know that mercury causes neurotoxicity there's no controversy about that does it cause autism it contributes to the damages that lead to autism Jordan was not born with autism he was a normal child he was injured by vaccinations and the injuries would to his autism certainly this is a controversial point in the medical field because the conventional medical community has basically stated that there is no link between mercury and autism the science has been very clear all knows we have six studies that show mercury-containing vaccines don't cause autism and although there can be slight flaws I think in any of those studies once you have negative study after negative study after negative study I think you can say with comfort that the truth is emerged almost all vaccine studies are epidemiological studies which means that large groups of people are compared to each other there has been very little bench science that is looking at what happens at the molecular and cellular level in the body we really need to do both kind of studies in order to understand what really happens the research is incomplete and the certainty that's why stood on us by vaccine authorities is not scientific since 1999 the amount of mercury has been reduced in vaccinations but thimerosal is still present in some vaccines and it's pretty clear from the scientific evidence that any form of mercury in the body is toxic and it can cause damage the vaccine program it's one-size-fits-all every child is the same every child needs to be vaccinated regardless of their family history or their medical background what we don't know is what is sitting in their genetics that's potentially going to express itself or not express itself for a child to develop certain chronic illnesses my oldest child has learning disabilities asthma numerous food allergies my youngest son has a significant speech delay when you look back through their medical records they are all absolutely perfectly healthy until the day they are vaccinated and then is like clockwork every four weeks every six weeks we are at the doctor runny nose ear infection asthma respiratory problem since the vaccine has been licensed there have been more than 18,000 serious adverse event reports made to bears what's the government's response been to all this their response has been to issue a report that says all of these reactions and average events and deaths are a coincidence I'm so grateful that we're here together and if we need to unite across all of the different one almost eight years ago I think we were at an autism rally we started talking to other people and everybody had the same story about the mercury toxicity and this one parent George Mead decided to go ahead with this class action and we decided to join him in that Jordan and William Mead were two of the test cases that were chosen to represent the lawsuit the first thing that we learned is you can't you can't sue the drug company that made the vaccine our lawyer explained to us how there was this court set up specifically to address all the vaccine injuries there were a lot of civil lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and there was some extraordinary Awards because there were very devastating injuries so the vaccine that manufacturer said this isn't profitable for us we're not gonna make vaccines anymore so Congress stepped in and said okay we're going to stop lawsuits against manufacturers and you're not allowed to sue them unless you first go through this new program that was setting up called the vaccine compensation program or the vaccine good we face a future where presumably you could have 30 40 50 different vaccines recommended for university use and mandated and absolutely no accountability you have a prescription for disaster when you don't have anybody accountable in a court of law for what happens when vaccines go wrong do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but yourself you got I see everybody knows the value of vaccinations and every time you testify you tell us how valuable they've been and we already know that we're not here to say that vaccinations aren't important they're very important they've given us the highest quality of life of any civilization in the history of mankind that ain't what we're talking about we're talking about why they're putting mercury in vaccinations and why it's never been tested since 1929 when Lilly developed it mr. Egan as the Murrah Saul ever been tested by our health agencies it's been holy in that there were those early tests that you know of that were done by Lilly and when was their testing that was done in 1929 and okay well let's just follow up on that in 1929 they tested this on 27 people that were dying of meningitis all of those people died of meningitis and so they said there was no correlation between their death and the mercury in the vaccines that is the only test that's ever been done on thermos all that I know of it can you think of any other no in people no except over accidental exposures over here so we have mercury that's being put into people's bodies in the form of this preservative and has been since the 30s and it's never been tested by our health agencies and yet you folks come here and you testify that there's no conclusive evidence that the conclusive evidence and and the IOM says they favor yet this they don't say they're sure they say they favor rejection of a causal relationship between mercury and autism and other neurological disorders mr. Regan can you say to me right now that that amount of mercury being injected into a baby will not hurt it it's you know it's it's impossible to make those categorical statements of 100% right that's what I want to say too so so it is possible that the amount of mercury that's being injected even in trace amounts could damage a child neurologically right I don't think it has that capacity I mean it that's you know we can argue I know but you don't think it is but you can't say categorically can you the white do I have evidence for every single child for every possible dose the answer's no there you go we've been after this now for eight years now progress is being made but sometimes I feel like it's it's it's pulling a wisdom tooth where they get in your mouth with both feet in both hands and their inner jerk in that tooth out me it's just so hard to get it moving why they have left it in the vaccines is because they say it's such a minut amount it doesn't really hurt anybody but that's begging the question the question is is it toxic or not and it is it should be out of everything that goes into the human body and our health agencies in my opinion have been derelict in their responsibility of making sure that mercury is out of everything that goes into the human body especially vaccine well B says be well be well be well be well be well D urge your family friends and neighbors to take the new oral polio vaccine the new oral polio vaccine tastes good works fast and prevents polio so to protect we're taught in medical school that vaccines reduce the incidence rate of smallpox or polio one of the things that's missing in medical education is that they're not the only thing that play a role as to whether or not diseases come and go today what I'd like to talk about is the rationale of vaccines there was an article in Pediatrics journal which is the Bible Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics and this article looked at child mortality rates by age at death in the states between 1900 and 1998 and you see all the death rates of these diseases actually came down before the DPT was licensed in 1949 and the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963 so what is it that actually helped state and local health department's implemented public health measures and public education about hygienic practices thus vaccination does not account for the impressive declines and mortality seen in the first half of the century vaccines are drugs parents need to understand that vaccines are drugs vaccines contain antigens preservatives adjutants stabilizers antibiotics buffers diluents emulsifiers and inactivating chemicals they also contain residue from animal and human growth mediums ingredients in vaccines antigens these are the main components of any vaccine designed to induce an immune response they're either weakened germs or fragments of the disease organism some examples include viruses such as polio measles mumps bacteria such as Bordetella pertussis and toxoids such as Clostridium tetani ingredients in vaccines growth mediums viruses need a medium in which to propagate or reproduce common broths include chick embryo fibroblasts chip kidney cells mouse brains African green monkey kidney or vero cells human diploid cells cultured from aborted human fetuses MRC five are a 27 -

0,"Sugar Water. You can control your baby's physical pain
 during vaccinations with sugar water. There are many randomized control trials that
 have shown is that sugar water seems to be an effective way of reducing pain. ""What do you think?"" Probably by a number of mechanisms. Whether it's just the taste that these little infants have in their mouth which is distracting them, or whether there's some interference in the
 neurological pathways, it really seems to be effective. ""Okay."" You can make your own sugar water. Just mix a packet of white sugar, which is about one teaspoon or 5 mLs, in two teaspoons, or 10 mLs, of water. You can use distilled water or boiled water; you can use tap water in older infants if you know that the water in your area is
 safe for drinking. Put a drop at a time in your baby's mouth, about a minute or two before the needle, using a dropper, syringe, or medicine cup. You can also dip a soother in sugar water, and give your baby the soother to suck on
 during the needle. ""Oh, good boy!"" Be careful not to squirt the sugar water directly in the middle of your baby's mouth-- this can cause your baby to gag or spit up. Instead, put it on the side of the baby's mouth, inside the cheek. Hospitals use sugar water to reduce pain in babies, even newborn babies. It is safe and effective, but only use this as a pain medicine, not as a general comfort, or as a food. This is one of the many ways of reducing your baby's pain during vaccinations.

-1,">> Hi, my name is Paul Offit. I'm talking
 to you today from the Vaccine Education Center here at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
 And when children get to be 4, 5, 6 years of age, I think parents ask the question,
 ""What vaccines does my child need before starting school?"" And there are a few. I mean you need to get
 another booster of something called the DTaP vaccine: diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular
 pertussis, or whopping cough. You need to get a booster dose of the MMR vaccine, which
 is measles, mumps and rubella, or German measles. You need to get a booster dose of the varicella,
 or chickenpox, vaccine. And also need to get a fourth, or booster dose, of the polio vaccine. Now some of these viruses are commonly transmitted
 in school. Certainly were commonly transmitted in school. And if we let our guard down, we'll
 start to be transmitted in school again. Things like measles, and mumps, and German measles,
 often chickenpox, that's when children would get those diseases in schools because that's
 when everybody gets together and starts to share their viruses. So, it again, gives your child protection as
 they now intermingle with a lot of other children in a fairly closed space. And that's why it's
 important to get them."

Matt Paula check will be back with us in January to kick off the new year with style and gusto now for those of you that have been listening sending in questions and comments thank you so much it adds so much to the show and it's something that we dearly appreciate and please continue to help spread the word that every monday from 11 a.m. to noon pacific time this show will bring you special guests that can inspire educate and in some cases entertain while bringing answers and options to making your lives happier healthier and more successful now this show we will address issues such as locating a runaway teen family crisis intervention building self-esteem dealing with addictions and so much more and we will introduce you to talented authors caring people with new innovations in the areas of health security and fun for you and your family now with our experience working with families in crisis we have really been blessed and very fortunate to meet and work with some of the top professionals in many of the helping fields who are all working to make this world a better place for all of us now today we have a very interesting subject and i'll just start with a piece of information a piece of law that was passed in in 2015 california lawmakers voted to approve SB 277 and that was a bill that ended granting vaccine exemptions to parents who would cite personal or religious reasons although they did put an exemption in to allow medical exemptions but what this rule has done is it's really had a huge blow to the anti-vaccine movement but after the lawmakers cited the hundred and forty-seven people that contracted measles in disneyland in Lake 2014 they decided that this was going to be their decision and you know they you know they stated that you know in orch that they believe that in order to prevent widespread outbreaks of measles mumps and rubella that they believe that the National Vaccine rate must be between 96 and ninety-nine percent now at the time of the musicals outbreak California's vaccination rate for these diseases was between fifty and eighty-six percent so to some immunizations against childhood illnesses are touted as one of the greatest achievements in modern medicine to others it's looked at as something to wear maybe Big Pharma has seen another way to make a lot of money so the question is if it is the greatest achievement for modern medicine why would parents rather risk their child contracting a deadly disease than simply receiving a round of vaccines well to to talk about this topic with us which really poses the question why are parents rejecting vaccines we have Jennifer right who is an associate professor of sociology at the University of Colorado at Denver she is the author of the award-winning book fixing families parents power and the child welfare system she was the co-editor of reproduction in society and her new book which is the topic of our show calling the shots which delves directly into the much debated topic of childhood vaccines jennifer welcome to answers for the family i'm so happy to be with you today well you've certainly tackled the topic that has been in and out of the news now for the last few years so i think the first question would be why did you choose this topic what is what is your feelings on it and why did you have enough of a passion about it that you felt that you needed to write a book about it so i started thinking about this is a project i was living in California and I had finished my first book and was trying to think about other places that families are making decisions for their children and this is clearly a very different kind of topic and looking at the child welfare system but in a lot of the same his parents are interpreting law and policy making decisions for themselves interacting with institutions like schools and trying to decide what makes them feel like a good parent or at least a good enough parent and those are the questions I find most compelling at the time I started thinking about this I was living in California and there was sort of two simultaneous conversations happening around me one was an increasing stir of distrust of vaccinations and parents increasingly starting to opt out of them in small numbers and on the flip side we were having conversations when george bush was president about the possibilities of bioterrorism and what that would mean for first responders and i started thinking that this was a really interesting juxtaposition that on one hand we expect public systems to make sure we're all safe that we can't see weaponized viruses that we we can make sure we are protected against the rest of other kinds at the same moment that parents were rejecting an intervention that protects their children in much more pedestrian ways and I thought it was a pretty interesting opportunity to start thinking about the intersections between parents decisions their views of public policy their understandings of expertise and health and how they make sense on the ground every day as they try to do what's best for their children and that was a decade ago I started thinking about this and so for EM I think if anyone had told me then it was going to take me ten years to make sure I got the story right i don't know that i so would have done it but it was the right way to kind of follow the question through the ins and outs that you mentioned where the topic is really evolved and moved forward and really interesting and complicated ways in that time period well you know i think one of the the things that has come out at the same time is this huge distrust of Big Pharma that that and and a big corporations as a whole but but specifically Big Pharma what are some of the findings that you have had in regards to to their involvement and and is it something that we should really be worried about that they're having that much influence on the decision makers in regards to either our legislature or the experts who are making the decisions on if this is something that's good for us or so one way I approach this question is you know I started with you know really the question of like what our parents doing when they're faced with this decision in the first sometimes in the first 30 minutes of becoming a parent they're asked to start making vaccine decisions and over the last decade I've talked to parents who choose to opt out of summer or all vaccines but I've also talked to pediatricians faculty and researchers members of federal regulatory boards I've talked to complementary health providers to really try to understand this from as many perspectives as I could capture and what I really look to is you know where the points of disconnect and how people can understand the same question in different ways and I mention this because I think it's a really important way of thinking that um you know I think the parents are often who don't fancy don't vaccinate are sometimes described in ways that they're ignorant that they're not informed that they're stupid or they're armed with an Internet education in very dismissive ways and at the same time parents who distrust vaccines tend to be very very confident in their dismissal of all expertise and what I was really aiming to do was to try to bring these perspectives into conversation so with a little bit less bifurcated that we could find some common ground that we could see points of disconnect and what you're mentioning is that this question of trust is really profound when we asked people to vaccinate their children what we're asking them is to please participate in public health to make sure that members of the community who are most vulnerable are protected even if they can't be safely vaccinated themselves and we're asking people to work together as communities and absorb some minimal risk to themselves or their children and to do so we have to trust that all aspects of vaccines have been fully vetted that there is faces they could possibly be that they're well measured their well manufactured there well as odd that the manufacturing facilities are inspected and as safe as possible with all known science and that's the question that parents often highlight as a point of distrust so that they're not sure that the federal regulatory bodies that are responsible for ensuring that the safety of vaccines is upheld and constantly monitored is good and to your pointed out you know pharmaceutical questio pharmaceutical companies in their role in the US we have really trusted public health to for-profit corporations so we've really looked to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture not just vaccines but other life-saving medications and we expect them to do so epically in ways that that they have some profit motive to do and in fact are legally obligated to make a profit researchers point to the great disagreement about how profitable vaccines really are and whether they're profitable at all but for parents know whether or not they want to trust their children's health to those companies remains I'm a question that they're not they're not entirely on board as well and I know some of the statistics that that those that are against the vaccine some of the statistics that they bring out for instance one of which because we just did a show in regards to autism is the huge rise in autism and I've seen to where they've tried to tie it 2-2 the influx of greater vaccines so again I've seen that now at the same time I've also seen it tied to the change in our diet so I'm not saying that 11 is accurate or the other but what was your findings in regards to those that were tying it to to certain things that we were seeing within our children I had imagined when I started that autism was going to be a much more pressing concern of the parents i spoke with because there had been so much media coverage starting in the early night led the mid to late 1990s when the US began looking at mercury content and seafood and other environmental sources and look to vaccines as well at the same time that there was research in the UK suggesting that there was a connection between vaccines and autism and the process and the guides that might yield these kinds of mechanisms what I found in talking to parents is that their concerns are often more diffused so occasionally I talk to parents you say autism is our greatest concern but often what I hear is something more general that they're not sure that it's entirely safe to act upon the immune system and young children and how do we know that that doesn't have long-term results in 30 or 40 years so how do we know that the safety profile which might be okay in the immediacy doesn't have long-term consequences and some of those might be autism but really what I heard with questions about autoimmune disease rising rates of diabetes and adults that rising rates of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases and a general sense that they didn't feel that the science is clear enough to make them believe that vaccines were entirely safe now that calculation only makes sense along sign a different calculation which is how necessary are vaccines so what I find is that parents are often engaging in a somewhat complicated process of evaluating the risk of disease the risk of infection and also the severity of the disease's we vaccinate against and stacking that up against any concerns they have about the individual vaccines that are recommended for children in order for them to attend school or childcare settings and in those calculations they may overestimate risk and underestimate benefit but I think they're gathering as much information as they can and trying to make what they feel is the best decision for their own children that makes sense now you you mentioned mercury and I read that mercury that mercury at one time was in many of the vaccines of the past and they were then connecting it as you were saying that the research that was done in England to some of the problems with vaccine is it true and and if so is it true that that the mercury has now been removed from the vaccines because I had also read that I'm getting feedback on my own voice it could be all money here you twice so in terms of mercury it's an important I think it's an interesting question you know the history and I spent some time in the book explaining this history because I found it so fascinating myself most of the research we have about the dangers of mercury come from that bill mercury in studies of that compound specifically the vaccines that were using system aerosol is an ethyl mercury compound so it's actually a different chemical compound that's metabolized differently in the body the problem is there's not a lot of research on that cell mercury and so a lot of the conversations that were happening in the late 1990s and early 2000s around this question we're doing the best they could to extrapolate what was known from methyl mercury research and estimating how that might work with the marisol so the there was no all the research at that time shows that the marathon had no long-term health consequences that could be identified and some of the studies are quite powerful looking at countries with nationalized health care where half the country has vaccines with the marathon and half didn't very high-powered studies and nonetheless at the time the advisory groups responsible for vaccine safety made the decision that to be under the precautionary principle to be as safe as possible there was no reason to continue to use the marathon vaccines and so it was removed when I talk to parents about this like don't you feel better the marathon's no longer in vaccines the challenge is that all vaccines still need a preservative if they come in multi-dose vials so often we send out back beans in vials that can be used for several different immunizations and there's syringes that are going in and out of the bottle and in history we have examples of contamination of the miles so all vaccines have them that have multi multi-dose vials have some kind of preservative so what happened when Tamara thought was removed is that other kinds of preservatives still needed to be used and parents now and I talked to them about that the marrow cells gone now point to the other kind of preservatives is equally concerning to them and so again it's not like one concern like we solved the marathon we don't think it causes autism so it's okay what I hear from parents is that it's a much more generalized concern about the long-term health of children stacked against how necessary is it to really vaccinate against these diseases that very few people have seen in their lifetime and you mentioned some of the some of this the surveys that you've seen where they've they've handled you know they've done a support or a group to where half of them had this in it in half of MIT didn't I mean we've all been getting vaccines now for a very long time what are some of the results that that tells the experts that it's still a positive you know what when I talk to parents who are concerned about vaccine safety I do talk to a handful of parents who are hardliner they don't believe any vaccines have any value I sought to parent Tuesday that vaccines don't really work that polio would have disappeared by itself and that the vaccine got credit for that and that's a very numerically small portion of the population when I the vast majority of parents were talking about and it's worth remembering it's a very small number numerically but it's not nothing so income you know in California which in some ways looked a lot like Colorado where I conducted a lot of my interviews with parents there's a portion of kindergartners for example in Colorado which still has the exemptions that California has been eliminated that don't vaccinate against any vaccines and that's we hover around seven to nine percent which is pretty high for nationally but when we look more generally about whether parents are following recommendations for all vaccines what we find is close to twenty to twenty-five percent of American parents are opting out of some vaccines or are administering them in a schedule other than the one recommended by experts and to me that's really the more compelling question it's once we start getting as high as twenty or twenty-five percent of parents who are not trusting the recommendations provided by perils of scientists and professional organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics and I think we have to take a different look about what counts of knowledge what counts as expertise how do we know when to trust recommendations and to me as a sociologist a very compelling question is what does it mean when parents trust their own judgment more than they trust an entire body of national scientists about when vaccines are necessary and which vaccines are important and that means a much more pressing question and what is the answer you came up from that I think there's a like all things it's complicated which is how it takes a decade to tell a story so there's a lot of different aspects to this question so from parents perspectives what I heard often was that some vaccines feel more necessary and I used feel often because parents frequently cited their intuition and their sense of their own children and the powerful motivator for when to make decisions about vaccines so many said things like Texas which is ubiquitous in the environment but not actually contagious person to person was a very important vaccine many-sided polio as a vaccine against the disease they believed was really a serious but many parents pointed to things like varicella which is chicken pox it's something that they felt was really not a compelling argument for a vaccine but I actually had two parents who said that they didn't really believe that the vaccine against whooping cough was very important and that if their kids became infested they felt they could really manage that disease themselves and keep their children safe long term and those are much more complicated sorts of calculations that make very little sense to people who study vaccines to create vaccines to licensed vaccines and to monitor them because they see the severity of the disease is very differently than parents now I know that there was in and there's a variety of different vaccines so I think one of my questions you know will be you know is there a a higher rate of adverse reactions to to one type of vaccine over another but one of the ones that was in the news just a few years ago and it was one that I think all all girls and I think around 10 to 13 years old or whatever we're supposed to get and I know that and I can't remember the name of it now but there was a it was a lot of pushback from parents that that really were were not in agreeance with this particular one what was that one what was the argument and and what did you learn about that so you're thinking of that the vaccine against the human papillomavirus HPV and it's marketed by Merck under the name gardasil there's a second back pain in the market called cervarix this excuse me that was last lessons in the Europe first and the HPV vaccines I think a really interesting example of how parents makes a clean decisions so the HPV vaccine is recommended for everyone now not just girls to be administered some time after the age of 10 or 12 up to the age of 26 it's administered in three doses and it protects against the most carcinogenic strains of a virus that's virtually ubiquitous on University campuses for example so something like eighty percent of young people come in contact with HPV an HPV is with the leading cause of cervical cam it's I think the sole cause of cervical cancer and is now the link to head neck throat and anal cancers so we know that it's a virus that causes cancer but not all strains of HPV do and that a certain portion of people who encounter HPV will manage to clear the virus from their system themselves without vaccination so parents often look at this vaccine in ways that are somewhat perplexing to them do I really need to vaccinate a twelve-year-old against a disease that's it that comes from sexual contact it's not necessarily intercourse but it comes from any kind of genital contact with someone who's infected do I really need to do this is it the kind of thing that's really necessary and when parents start asking these questions how necessary is this they're stacking it against their perceptions of what are the benefits of this vaccine is that a powerful enough case to make do I trust the safety monitoring enough of a new vaccine that did receive expedited approval because it was the only vaccine on the market against this potentially lethal disease and so those are questions for a new vaccine that doesn't have a long term track record and parents really spend a lot of energy evaluating this necessity question against the safety question and I think HPV is one of our newest vaccines on the market really speak to that tension very directly because it's also about sexual contact it also brings opportunities to think through how my child behave as an adult how is a parent can I support different kinds of health practices without vaccinations and is this really necessary and I talk to a lot of parents who talk about the ways their parenting will support their health without vaccinations and what was the side effects that they were claiming that they that they were so against the range of side effects that have been described with HPV are are complicated to understand there was a report mostly on YouTube of a woman who could only run backwards she lost the ability to run forward after vaccination attract a lot of researchers who say that they can't identify any biological probabilities I would start to be true the more common side effect that people talk about it's supposed to be a very painful vaccine it does cause I think it has one of the highest rates of people fainting after vaccination and and so that's like a short-term effect and then in terms of long-term effects it's pretty hard to identify significant risks that come with it and I should just say though that it's also really hard to understand long-term causality anyway and so knowing you know did this vaccine change something fundamentally that I might not know for a long time it's a harder one to know if I talked about creating researchers they point to this vaccine actually is one of the greatest accomplishments of science so that it has no viral protein in it it uses a very complicated technology to really hone in on exactly the kinds of viral response it wants from immune system so there's not any other antigens in it that's very precise and as of a few months ago it looks like the efficacy rate so its ability to prevent it is is better than was expected so that sounds from a scientific perspective and the medical community's perspective like a win from a parent perspective hearing that something is perfectly manufactured that it has nothing natural and it's entirely synthetic proteins sounds actually more terrifying than reassuring and that for many parents the idea that this entirely unnatural substance will be injected into my child's body actually is anxiety-provoking not reassuring and that's you know an example of the kinds of disconnects and how we talk about these questions wow you know I you know I I love the fact that you have gathered so much information in regards to this because it was one of the things that and then I was looking at at a time you know when you mentioned about the 90s and you know my kids were young and so and I was a room dad in the class so it was it was a topic of conversation with some of the other parents of you know what do we do and you know one of the things I think is great about you putting out this book is is that there really wasn't any information in other words you know we would we would try to find out its parents but you know there would be a piece of information that would come out but then you know then there would be someone else that would have something that would be the exact opposite and we'd go okay well what do we believe then so I love the fact that you have put together so much great information in regards to a subject that I think a lot of us were we're really very uneducated about now for everybody out there stay with us we're going to take a break but I want you to know we will be right back and

we are talking with Jennifer right and we're talking about her new book calling the shots why parents are rejecting vaccines and if you are just now tuning in she has spent ten years gathering as much information as possible to be able to help educate all of us as parents to be able to know I mean what is the real information out there and especially in this day and age of Internet information you can probably find an argument to almost anything you know you can find an opposing argument out there so so Jennifer again I appreciate you coming on I appreciate you putting together the book and and one of the questions that that came in and this is one that came in from a listener this one reads my main concern as a parent is the presence of aluminum in vaccines I have confirmed in my research that it is added to half of all vaccines to boost their effectiveness although some experts claim the amount of aluminum contained in vaccines is safe I have seen studies in infants that haven't proven that what does your research show regarding this topic and this is from Francis J Francis sounds like a really diligent parent who's doing a lot of reading and information gathering and I think that's like a really important thing to recognize that you know so often parents are to distrust vaccine claims are dismissed as not thoughtful or as ignorant or as inconsiderate or selfish I think this is a great example of a parent who's working really hard aluminum is one of the new preservative that's used to replace to replace Samara thaw and I think it isn't about half the vaccines based on their multi vile usage and in terms of the safety studies you know one of the complicated questions I think we can always come back to is what do we think of the power of the studies how how well conducted with the studies are they well designed what kind of evidence do we have and then who do we trust with that information and I think that's a really important question to ask I think parents should be asking questions they should ask them of their pediatricians and and there should be dialogue about it there is concern about aluminum as a heavy metal the studies I've seen say that it does that it's in small doses and does not accumulate in the body the way some heavy metal do and so it's safety profile as I've read it looks pretty good not an associative and so I try not to make any claims of understanding the chemistry of these kinds of issues but I think it's a great way of pointing to this question about who do we trust and who do we ask we have what I found was that there's really two simultaneous pressures culturally that parents are responding to that that me right at vaccine questioning one is that we have this cultural moment I think we're parents are being asked to assume responsibility for everything that happens to their children we are told that parents you know have to pick the perfect school for their kids to make sure they have the perfect diet but they're not home alone for too long but they have some independence that they have the right extracurricular activities that their college applications are coming together but there's a huge amount of parents to invest in their own children and not a lot of conversations about worrying about everyone's children and other people's children and simultaneous to that cultural thread this kind of individualist parenting we do something very similar around health right now so we asked people to track their calories to monitor their steps to keep track of their you know their fitness to assume personal responsibility for all of their house and when we hear people become ill we often asked what did they do wrong to become affect not you know what did we as a community do not to support better health for everyone what we know is that most of disease has environmental factors to it it's not entirely individually controlled and yet the way we talk about managing ribbed I argue correlates perfectly with the way we talk about parents being the gatekeeper for all good and bad outcomes of their children and that the collision of these two moments have placed a lot of pressure on parents I would say probably like Frances to feel like you have like the parents in your classroom to that you have to do perfect research that you have to understand the science that you have to make decisions because you if you're not asking these questions and making decisions for your own child then it's hard to feel like you're a good enough parent and and more generally outside of like the individual choices of individual vaccines does the larger conversation concerns me more which is this moment where we can say that as long as my kids raise enough money to have PE it's okay that other kids in the same city don't that we really have taken away concern for anything kids and connect it throughout the community in ways that carry different risk so that it's not only about making the perfect decision for one's own child around things like vaccines but that all these decisions have complicated repercussions for others in the community and they don't know that we talked enough about that yeah and I think you bring up a good point and I know that as a room dad one of the things I learned the hard way was when you go in for the first time as a kindergarten room parent you know you you catch all the things that all the other kids have because you're not used to it you know so so there was it was one of those things that some of the room parents were or the the room moms were telling me oh yeah well you have such and such because it's your first time ever doing this well one of the things that it did was I then never got sick again my you know on the first day of school because I had built up a resistance to all of those new childhood diseases but at the same time you know so were the other kids so is there also that argument of well you know by putting them around other kids and by getting some of these things that's how your body builds up a you know a resistance to it you know so you know at what point are we you know are we protecting so much and when you mention about the individual you know the the person who's working on their own individual child it by them not doing that being the one that doesn't are they bringing whatever that that they're not immune to into the school are they now bringing something into the school that is now putting others at risk is that part of the issue here yeah I think your experience of the room here and they think is a ubiquitous one when kids at our preschool or any kind of group school environment whether it's preschool or kindergarten all of a sudden we put a bunch of small people who are prone to sharin
-1,in Panama City the average adult has been vaccinated around 30 times throughout his life between the time a child is born on the first year of life he will get to have themed vaccines moreover from one year until four years of age he will get thirteen immunisations more and between 4 and 19 years will get at least four more vaccines 30 might sound like a big number however there the necessary number to give these seasons from spreading and to keep a healthy population even though vaccines have been proven to be lifesavers they are a very controversial issue since Ron claims were made linking vaccines to diseases such as autism and deities many people believe they're not saving now I believe that vaccinating kids is not a good thing there's a lot of research done stating that vaccines are commonly causing a lot of kids to be very sick they can be anorexic autism ADHD and so forth a lot of vaccines also have been known to be that have ingredients that are not even normal to be human for human consumption in my opinion I don't think that scenes are a good thing however in a server may 2 2014 MINI people only one of them believe that vaccines could lead to autism the other 23 we're very much in favor of vaccines my three kids they have been vaccinated since they were newborns up until they are where a teenager's thing I really think back scenes are required for good health because they really have a lot of benefits because it will help not to get any of these diseases that you are vaccinated for or any disease spread I can tell you about my experience I believe they're really beneficial for human and it has more benefits than risks I am very very much in favor of vaccine I feel that the science has completely proven it over and over and over again I know that in the news lately there's been a lot of talk a lot of things going on with trying to relate vaccines to autism but I also know that when they tried to recreate those same studies that this particular doctor claims were true they were unable to recreate the same studies and the science ended up being fraud fraudulent I have a three and a half year old daughter that since birth I have I've opted to completely vaccinate I think it's important because she's going to go into school in the fall and I would not feel comfortable if my child is in a classroom with other children that are not vaccinated at the same level that she is because they could be exposed to the diseases that are used to be you know non-existent but because people are now choosing to not vaccinate their children are now becoming more common nowadays even in California where there's a good pocket of a population of people that have opted out of vaccines and they've actually had an increase increase in measles contractions so things like that that you don't expect I really don't want my child to be exposed to other children that are not vaccinated I want my child to be as protected as I possibly can have her be protected um can we protect her completely from all diseases no but I think it's smart of parents to say hey there's a vaccine that could possibly help your child not get infected so you know the science shows that it's effective and I'm gonna go for it moreover the Ministry of Health has an all year long campaign that invites people to get vaccinated their goal is to have an overall healthy population and also to cure awareness nosotros en todo lo ciento de salud tenemos vicunas durante todo el ah no pero esta semana de la panzanella Americas es donde le damos como tributo dónde le damos como Mayo refers Oh a lo que son logic Oona's bell Ministerio de salud cuenta con una Rami enta que el primer pen Centro America que le Abajo Abajo no Bovie Evos che ba a comunidade hopper Tadas en donde no a a acceso para persona que puedas en tres importante achenar sake' nada amigo men oreja de mentos ya que tu no hi u de lo que la prevention eradication de todo lo que sorry information tokura nika's la que se puede venir case uncommon dengue y este tipo de infección a cow's ass porn akitoki pienso que el padre vicuna es su momenta importante
1,"we respect the atom bomb but how many of us respect this this dish full of disease producing organisms if allowed to grow unchecked may be capable of more widespread loss of life than a dozen atom bombs but scientists have found a strong defense vaccines which stimulate the formation of antibodies once formed they may remain in the blood and confirm immunity against another attack of the same disease I was taught in medical school that vaccines are safe and they're effective I had no reason to believe otherwise it wasn't until the New York State passing of the hepatitis B mandate in 1991 and struck me as kind of odd that they were mandating a vaccine for newborn babies when babies were not at risk for developing hepatitis B infection it made me question whether or not we're doing a service to children by giving them all these vaccines and injections there's more than just an assumption that vaccines are safe it is pretty much regarded as law but I don't think it's that black and white there are many greys and you have more and more people who are questioning it and with good reason because the science is not there to really state that vaccines are truly safe my wife is five months pregnant and I'm for parental rights not government coercion telling us what we can do what we can't do with our kids there is no other mandated procedure and our that is its first of all it's illegal we can't have you can't make you can't make people do procedure that they don't want the parents have to be the ones to make the decisions for what's best for Mike for our kids it can't be the government saying that it's against the nuremberg laws and it's ridiculous since against the state constitution and it's against their own bylaws here I mean I was reading the I've been reading some legislation that was passed years ago but these two do state sterilizations and they thought that that was a good thing you know so you can't let the state make the decisions the people have to decide and parents have to decide that's why I'm here they've gone from when you and I were kids they had like eight shots now that's up to 70 shots and multi shots and then I'll tell you the safety of these things there is no there's no efficacy study in the toxicity of these things were having more and more side-effects you're having more more autism when you go from autism which is unheard of in America in 1932 was one in 5,000 after she'd started being preserved with mercury which is the second most toxic thing on this planet next to plutonium and then you go to let's go up a couple of decades by 1990 it was one and two hundred now it's one in 88 now truthfully it's true that a lot of autism rates are grouped into one but there is something that's really happening and one of the most vulnerable things you can do to a child who doesn't have an immune system is give them a shot and I'll just give you one example if you take the hepatitis B okay the hepatitis you're only going to get that from drug use and you're going to get that from intravenous drug use and gain from sexual contact and yet they won't let a baby out of the hospital unless insisting on getting the shot I'm sorry there's an unnecessary shot that they don't need to have when especially when the baby's immune system isn't developed the baby's immune system is the mother's immune system so it is beyond ridiculous it's criminal government can't make decisions on what I do to my body and my children's body that they have to stay out of that that's not something that's open for discussion I got to make my choice and I'm going to what's best for my child and to the idea that they're going to mandate that you if I don't want to vaccinate my kid they can't go to school unless they get a consent from a doctor that's the lunacy show them the thimerosal long which we keep in a metal container because we're lit afraid of it and it's a very fine powder this is this is thimerosal which is labeled very toxic as cumulative effects can cause damage to the kidneys to the respiratory system skin to the nervous system specifically warns on here that it can cause reproductive and developmental toxicity meaning that it can cause things like autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders this is immensely toxic stuff and this is what's in the vaccine it's important to realize we're talking about a whole range of products vaccines are a big one because of course you're directly injecting it for example this is tetanus vaccine this one expires it's a lot dated now in 2007 here's the thimerosal one to ten thousand is a preservative perhaps the the biggest one in the u.s. at least that's exposure to mercury is the influenza vaccine influenza vaccine is now recommended for all pregnant women all infants all children on a yearly basis you suppose that less influenza understand that thimerosal is not added at the end it's not like well that factory next year can make thimerosal free thimerosal you either have to have a thimerosal free factory or you have to not have one they add thimerosal at each step because the factory is not clean and not sterile so you either have to have an expensive sterile factory where you don't need thimerosal all you have to have one that produces thimerosal it's gonna need thimerosal of something the whole time it needs to be stopped this is the influenza vaccine from adventist pastor or their flu zone by Marisol 25 micrograms of mercury per dose I'd like to point out that a lot of people didn't know and I'm one of them I've given 2,000 rhogam shots I've been in vaccines for 35 years I didn't know that rhogam had thimerosal in it so I think I'll the doctors were unaware they were unaware that even the word thimerosal meant mercury he had been this bright or cautious baby speaking in full sentences by the age of two after that shot we got the diagnosis that he was minimally brain-damaged and the recommendation was to put him in a self-contained classroom for the learning disabled I became committed to reforming the mass vaccination system and I worked for 30 years to make vaccine policies safer in the 1980's children were being asked to get 23 doses of seven vaccines in the last three decades that number has grown to 69 doses of 16 vaccines that's triple the numbers of doses of vaccines we gave our children in the early 1980s rates of autism are jumping an alarming 10 to 17 percent every year every 20 minutes in this country another child is diagnosed with autism all you have to do is ask the guidance counselors the teachers the principals and all of them across the board will tell you that we are seeing a rise in the number of children with disabilities that is clear the CDC states that one in hundred ten children have autism but autism is just one piece of a bigger problem the bigger issue is that one in six kids in this country has some form of neurodevelopmental disability fifty years ago children didn't even get type-2 diabetes now it's an emerging epidemic as our a long list of ailments which used to be rare and have now been mainstreamed things like asthma and autism an acid reflux and arthritis allergies adult acne attention deficit disorder and that's just the A's vaccine safety is not just about autism autism is only one kind of brain and immune dysfunction that is associated with vaccination millions and millions of children now in America are chronically ill and disabled and during the same time period that the numbers of doses of vaccines have more than tripled that we're giving our children we have seen this explosion of chronic disease and disability and to take off the table the use of a pharmaceutical product like a vaccine as a potential cofactor in this explosion of chronic disease and disability among our children is irresponsible yes if we talk about the children who have learning disabilities who weren't born that way but who have learning disabilities if we talk about the children who develop ad D attention deficit disorder if we talk about the children who have P D D the pervasive developmental disorder Asperger's every kind of disease process that you can talk about that has this neurologic learning problem when we add those children into the mix and I believe firmly that they should be added that they are all on one spectrum and it's one process you're talking about one child in every six and those numbers were not like that you will talk to teacher after teacher who's been in this business of teaching children for thirty years and they will all tell you it wasn't like that when I started teaching it's like that now and something has changed and they laugh the teachers laugh when a physician says oh it's just better diagnosis they were all there before I can promise you that if you had had this many children walking through grocery stores having full-on meltdown temper tantrums thirty years ago it would have been diagnosed as autism so about ten years ago a mother came up to me and said hey Doc did you know there's mercury in vaccines and I hadn't a clue and so my question was well if mercury is in the vaccines what else is in the vaccines so I open up the package inserts and I see mercury and aluminum and formaldehyde and antibiotics and then preservatives like polysorbate 80 so I asked the pediatric resident I said tell me how does the body process those materials she could not answer me and no one in science can because no one has looked Health Canada says the best way to avoid the flu is vaccination which in many provinces is free well let's see if these recent flu shot recipients can help reveal the mystery of why cheetos and pop-tarts list their ingredients while vaccines do their best not to are you aware of the ingredients in the vaccine I know there's some egg products I don't think they offered us a list of ingredients so that no I don't know this is blind faith for me did you know that there's a mercury in that shot no I didn't oh I did not know are you glad that it's free yes well you know it's not really free yes well that's paying for through our taxes right so if I sneeze right now would you be okay with that you know these people confirm two things some are happy to wait in line for a secret serum and nobody likes getting sneezed on well what if drug companies are right what if tricking your body into thinking it's already sick doesn't make you sick what if there's not enough vaccine to go around you should know that making your own is easier than brewing your own beer and it could save your life well the first thing you need is a live virus is there anyone here suffering from the flu sir would you favor us by discharging directly under these chicken embryos uh I could do the help hey we now have our chicken embryos and our live virus now from the pickled frog jar your local schools biology class will keep that virus dead like the drug companies do with formaldehyde now careful don't get any frog in the mix that'd be gross now let's add a little either careful don't fall asleep and then we dump some detergent in there that keeps it clean and remember when your mother lost her mind when you played with mercury because it never leaves your body well that makes it a great preservative if you have a thermometer well staying healthy is a lot more important than room temperature now all of this goes into the centrifuge like this blender and hey hey hey it's vaccine for the whole family well the debate over whether vaccines usually don't work or aren't fully safe may never end which at least explains why the contents are rarely publicized ah fine I'm fine but it's government recommended oh well that's my eye on the flu shot you would think that the FDA would take each of those ingredients and study them and in human infants to make sure that each of the each of those ingredients are safe well they haven't done that they've never taken vaccine quantities of each of those ingredients and done any sort of safety testing to confirm that each one of those ingredients are safe I'm a neuroscientist by training and my studies are in the origin of neurological disease I develop animal models of Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's disease recently we've been looking at aluminum which is common to many vaccines it's used as an adjuvant that means helper without the aluminum the vaccine basically does not provide any long-term protection and so my research has looked at injectable vaccine how it might impact the nervous system the difference between injectable aluminum versus dietary aluminum is that aluminum that you eat is excreted fairly rapidly injectable aluminum however is meant to stick around and that's precisely why it's there in the first place that's what an adjuvant does so we simply did the really simple experiment of taking the same stuff out of the vaccines the aluminum hydroxide and injecting it into mice into the muscles to see what would happen if we tried to mimic the vaccine schedule we were quite surprised to see how rapidly the behavioural symptoms emerged they showed not only behavioral deficits function but they ultimately showed cognitive deficits as well and once we sacrifice the animals and started looking inside their brains and spinal cords we found massive damage to motor neurons and so we may be creating the conditions for Parkinson's disease Lou Gehrig's disease Alzheimer's disease maybe not immediately but maybe 20 30 40 years down tomorrow when I first saw her she was having problems with seizures and tractable headaches chest pains and I found out that she began having problems following the herd Gardasil vaccinations in my opinion there's little room for doubt concerning that this condition was caused by the Gardasil G every time she got a another injection she got worse and worse I think Gardasil should be taken off the market it hasn't been well tested before it was placed in the general public the FDA has a particular process that's called fast-tracking when there is a promising drug that comes forward Gardasil they had scheduled a four year trial but after 15 months they went to the FDA and said there is nothing like this vaccine on the market would you please consider this for fast-track the FDA said yes so within six months they approved it and as soon as they had it approved Merck said we will no longer continue our trial we're gonna stop our trial because our drug is now approved we as an example of why no vaccine particularly a vaccine for children should ever be fast-tracked by the FDA less than 1% of all cancer deaths are for cervical cancer and yet we now have a vaccine that was only studied in 1,200 girls under the age of 16 before it was recommended for universal use by the CDC in all 11 and 12 year old girls in this country that's not science that's politics Texas Governor Rick Perry has ordered that school girls in his state must get the Gardasil shot it's also worth pointing out that the AP says that Governor Perry has ties to Merck including the fact that one of the company's lobbyists in the state of Texas is his former chief of staff we are standing publicly for the legal right to follow our conscience when making educated vaccine decisions for our families if the state can force you to put your life on the line or your child's life on the line for any medical intervention then the state has too much power more than 2,000 Prince George's County students have not gotten their state mandated shots tonight and ultimatum to some of those parents come to court get the shots or else more than 1600 students and their parents have been order to appear in Circuit Court for the children to be immunized we can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way but it's gonna have to get done I went over there and saw the parents lining up they had police with dogs and guns patrolling the courthouse I thought to myself there is something wrong with this we shouldn't be summoning appearance under threat of imprisonment and fines because they didn't get their children a hepatitis B vaccination or a chicken pox vaccination Americans are well aware that a number of prescription drugs that have been licensed as safe had been found to be unsafe after they're used by millions of people and yet when it comes to vaccines which are mandated by law there's somehow this separation made the vaccines couldn't possibly be the same the majority of vaccine research is paid for by the vaccine manufacturers themselves so the people who are approving the vaccines are taking the word of the pharmaceutical companies the pharmaceutical companies have been allowed to be to present at the table at the FDA and the CDC and I think a firewall needs to be built between those in government who are regulating making policy for and developing vaccines and those pharmaceutical companies that are making profit off the sale of vaccines you know it's no wonder parents are asking questions it's because doctors that are making these policies are financially benefiting from these policies the ACIP is the organization that approves vaccine policy for the United States you have some doctors on that board that have a direct financial interest in these vaccines that's a huge conflict of interest do you believe anybody was getting funds from Merck or any of the other pharmaceutical companies should be on advisory panels that are making judgments about pharmaceuticals coming from those companies or do you believe that's a conflict of interest I think that's a difficult question to answer hmm wait a minute let me get this straight do you think it's a difficult question to answer if somebody is getting funding of some type from a pharmaceutical company for them to sit on an advisory panel that's approving or giving their approval to a new drug that's coming on the market you don't see that as a conflict it's important to point out that recommendations for vaccinations are made independently by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians and those recommendations are virtually always in harmony with the recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices the pharmaceutical industry is probably the most powerful lobbying force in Washington DC there are 535 members of Congress the House and the Senate there are over 600 lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry they are a very powerful force they give a lot of money to both political parties they give a lot of money to individual candidates they don't give me but they give an awful lot of money various candidates and they have a very strong lobbying effort and so getting anything done in Congress that Pharma the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want done is very very difficult that is one of the problems the other problem is they have very very strong influence with the Food and Drug Administration and Health and Human Services and CDC and because of their their strength it's very difficult to to get change mate I mean we're talking today about autism but there's something in even or as great at stake here as the autism question and whether or not the MMR vaccine and other vaccines may be contributing to autism and that is are we letting pharmaceutical companies have too great an influence on the decision making process that affects every one of our lives do we want to give at a child nine vaccinations in one day do we want to give them 31 or 32 or 33 vaccinations between the time they're born in their age six isn't that maybe a little bit overload I ended up taking him to my pediatrician she just said oh he's autistic that's how it goes sometimes you know they're born that way but we felt like there was something medically going on with him so we took him to this doctor and he said the first thing I want to do is check him for heavy metals I looked at those results and the mercury was off the end of the page I sort of freaked out I thought he's mercury poison where did that mercury come from we tested the paint we tested the air I had the sawdust in my basement shop tested to see is there mercury on that when we talked to dr. green about it tell me what we were doing he said you don't have to look for where the mercury is coming from we know where it's coming from it's in the vaccines that Jordans been getting what are you guys since I began practicing in 1975 I saw one child with autism in the 80s one child with autism the early 90s and then in the late 90s I was literally flooded with patients I've evaluated and treated note approximately 2100 patients with autism the children who are here their parents will tell you we're definitely injured by vaccines they were fine and then they were gone so if I have parents screaming and I have science confirming that there's a problem with exposure to mercury and there's a problem with exposure to aluminum and there's a problem when you take a broken immune system and give it three live viruses on the same day then why don't we just want to fix that this is it's ridiculous that there are this many children in one little town in one of the pool all of them who have the same story Jordan received a mercury far exceeding EPA safety guidelines we know that mercury causes neurotoxicity there's no controversy about that does it cause autism it contributes to the damages that lead to hurt to them Jordan was not born with autism he was a normal child he was injured by vaccinations and the injuries led to his autism certainly this is a controversial point in the medical field because the conventional medical community has basically stated that there is no link between mercury and autism the science has been very clear on those we have six studies that show mercury containing vaccines don't cause autism and although there can be slight flaws I think in any of those studies once you have negative study after negative study after negative study I think you can say with comfort that the truth is emerged almost all vaccine studies are epidemiological studies which means that large groups of people are compared to each other there has been very little bench science that is looking at what happens at the molecular and cellular level in the body we really need to do both kind of studies in order to understand what really happens the research is incomplete and the certainty that's why stood on us by vaccine authorities is not scientific since 1999 the amount of mercury has been reduced in vaccinations but thimerosal is still present in some vaccines and it's pretty clear from the scientific evidence that any form of mercury in the body is toxic and it can cause damage you the vaccine program it's one-size-fits-all every child was the same every child needs to be vaccinated regardless of their family history or their medical background what we don't know is what is sitting in their genetics that's potentially going to express itself or not express itself for a child to develop certain chronic illness my oldest child has learning disabilities asthma numerous food allergies my youngest son has a significant speech delay when you look back through their medical records they are all absolutely perfectly healthy until the day they are vaccinated and then is like clockwork every four weeks every six weeks we are at the doctor runny nose ear infection asthma respiratory problem since the vaccine has been licensed there have been more than 18,000 serious adverse event reports made to bears what's the government's response been to all of this their response has been to issue a report that says all of these reactions and average events and deaths are a coincidence I'm so grateful that we're here together and if we need to unite across all of the different one almost eight years ago I think we were at an autism rally we started talking to other people and everybody had the same story about the mercury toxicity and this one parent George Mead decided to go ahead with this class action and we decided to join him in that Jordan and William Mead were two of the test cases that were chosen to represent the lawsuit the first thing that we learned is you can't you can't sue the drug company that made the vaccine our lawyer explained to us how there was this court set up specifically to address all the vaccine injuries there were a lot of civil lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and there were some extraordinary Awards because there were very devastating injuries so the vaccine that manufacture said this isn't profitable for us we're not gonna make vaccines anymore so Congress stepped in and said okay we're going to stop lawsuits against manufacturers and you're not allowed to sue them unless you first go through this new program that was setting up called the vaccine compensation program or in the vaccine court we face a future where presumably you could have 30 40 50 different vaccines recommended for university use and mandated and absolutely no accountability you have a prescription for disaster when you don't have anybody accountable in a court of law for what happens when vaccines go wrong do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but truth soap you got I see everybody knows the value of vaccinations and every time you testify you tell us how valuable they've been and we already know that we're not here to say that vaccinations aren't important they're very important they've given us the highest quality of life of any civilization in the history of mankind Danny what we're talking about we're talking about why they're putting mercury in vaccinations and why it's never been tested since 1929 when Lilly developed it mr. Egan as thimerosal ever been tested by our health agency it's been only in the Dewar those early tests that you know of that were done by Lilly and when was their testing that was done in 1929 and okay well let's just follow up on that in 1929 they tested this on 27 people that were dying of meningitis all of those people died of meningitis and so they said there was no correlation between their death and the mercury in the vaccines that is the only test that's ever been done on thermos all that I know of it can you think of any other no in people know I get accessor accidental exposures over here so we have mercury that's being put into people's bodies in the form of this preservative and has been since the 30s and it's never been tested by our health agencies and yet you folks come here and you testify that there's no conclusive evidence that conclusive evidence and and the IOM says they favor yet this they don't say they're sure they say they favor rejection of a causal relationship between mercury and autism and other neurological disorders mr. Eagan can you say to me right now that that amount of mercury being injected into a baby will not hurt it it's you know it's it's impossible to make those categorical statements of 100% right that's why we decided so so it is possible that the amount of mercury that's being injected even in trace amounts could damage a child neurologically right I don't think it has that capacity I mean that's you know we can argue I know but you don't think it is but you can't say categorically can you do I do I have evidence for every single child for every possible dose the answer is no there you go we've been after this now for eight years now progress is being made but sometimes I feel like it's it's it's pulling a wisdom tooth where they get in your mouth with both feet in both hands and they're jerking that tooth out me it's just so hard to get it moving why they have left it in the vaccines is because they say it's such a minut amount it doesn't really hurt anybody but that's begging the question the question is is it toxic or not and it is it should be out of everything that goes into the human body and our health agencies in my opinion have been derelict in their responsibility of making sure that mercury is out of everything that goes into the human body especially vaccine well B says be well be well be well be well be well d urge your family friends and neighbors to take the new oral polio vaccine the new oral polio vaccine tastes good works fast and prevents polio so to protect we're taught in medical school that vaccines reduce the incidence rate of smallpox or polio one of the things that's missing in medical education is that they're not the only thing that play a role as to whether or not diseases come and go today what I'd like to talk about is the rationale of vaccines there was an article in Pediatrics journal which is the Bible Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics and this article looked at child mortality rates by age at death in the United States between 1900 and 1998 and you see all the death rates of these diseases actually came down before the DPT was licensed in 1949 and the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963 so what is it that actually helped state and local health department's implemented public health measures and public education about hygienic practices thus vaccination does not account for the impressive declines and mortality seen in the first half of the century vaccines are drugs parents need to understand that vaccines are drugs vaccines contain antigens preservatives pageants stabilizers antibiotics buffers diluents emulsifiers and inactivating chemicals they also contain residue from animal and human growth mediums ingredients in vaccines antigens these are the main components of any vaccine designed to induce an immune response they're either weakened germs or fragments of the disease organism some examples include viruses such as polio measles mumps bacteria such as Bordetella pertussis and toxoids such as Clostridium tetani ingredients in vaccines growth mediums viruses need a medium in which to propagate or reproduce common broths include chick embryo fibroblasts chip kidney cells mouse brains african brain monkey kidney or vero cells human diploid cells cultured from aborted human fetuses MRC 5ra 27 -

-1,recently the rise of the anti backs movement pushed several countries to enforce in London here are three scientific facts that will help you make an educated decision vaccine save a huge amount of lives historically smallpox has killed 500 million dis bigger than many more but in 1918 thanks to a global immunization program it was eradicated in 1998 James Wakefield and other researchers published a paper claiming the specific kind of vaccines cause autism despite the huge head was eventually declared Portland's retracted by the publisher and the authors were held guilty of ethical violations and scientific misrepresentation number three there are claims that the chemical formaldehyde used to weaken vaccines prior to injection is toxic in large quantities itself is but not in the microscopic doses used in vaccines in fact your average fruit snap has a higher dose do you have any spare ante back documents good science will always suppress them
1,"this is a call for an uprising welcome to today's show well it's the 2019 golden turd Awards or I guess as they call it the Golden Globes but let's be realistic these shows are nothing but a front a place for all of these satanic Masonic Eastern Star witches and Satanists you sniff each other's rear ends and praise one another as the Sheep at home watch and just gush over what everyone's wearing and wishing that they could be there with all of these satanic losers who will be residing in hell and do time but what did I see when I flipped on the 2019 golden globes because usually I will cover these award shows recently yeah you know I'll flip in see if I notice anything but get a load of what I saw is pretty much within 60 seconds of tuning into this take a look at what they're pushing now that must be a huge coincidence right pushing the flu shot I mean what did I just talk about in my last video right suddenly everybody's dying of flu shots I mean excuse me dying of the flu everyone needs to get their flu shot or your child could end up dead you could end up dead right and remember all of these losers in this room are the influencers these are the talentless hacks who get pushed who clamor for fame and clamor for attention it's funny think you know guys like Jack Black start YouTube channels right they just start the channel and people are just like oh okay and it's trending in YouTube with no views and no subscribers because they want celebrities all of these people who are or they are all Satanists freemason you know bagel eaters and they want to make sure that they're all over every source of media as the influencers they know that YouTube has turned into a place where people are being I shouldn't say influence but they're learning things from other people they're learning about the deception that's currently going on right so you have people like Jack Black who has to have you to put them in the trending section or nobody would listen because nobody cares about these losers right realistically nobody cares now the Sheep out there don't realize why they care or why they look into their opinion or why they you know dress how they dress or why they accept the things they accept because they're under my control they think that it's all freedom of choice they don't realize that oh these are the people who are influencing my behavior these are the people who are influencing them you know from the music and the mind control and the witchcraft used in music you know like you just saw in that clip shot Chuck shot cha-cha-cha right I mean really like this is a song alright that's getting played over and over I mean could you guys write a song like that could any of us alright I mean well it's like oh somebody just wrote and they were like shot shut oh this is a hit this is gonna make millions of dollars right it's there to influence people to dumb you down repetition over and over and over right now the song stuck in people's head now people want to do shots the same with drugs the same with money all right strive for these things they want you to because they want you to fail but they also want you to give your allegiance and your soul to Lucifer without realizing it because most of these people don't realize what in the world they're doing not hard to see I mean go go walk around a mall like I've said a million times it's like walking in Zombieland I mean people are literally clueless you know I'm surprised everything I've ever been to a mall honestly maybe a decade okay and I'm not saying that sarcastically like a mall mall but I I'm you know if I went into a mall today I would expect to see like three or four people walk over the ledge just like texting walk over those don't even realize what they're doing you know cuz I see people around you know in areas where I do go out and that's pretty much what they do and they're walking into telephone poles you know so anyway back onto the top the topic here right the Golden Globes which usually what I'll do is I'll cover this and I'll go through all the symbols and the hand gestures and the agendas the agendas are pretty clear right all the women that go up talk about change all the men that go up talk about change a need for change right talking about the wall talking about control of guns right these are common themes of the New World Order that we constantly hear right pushing feminism Oh women have been you know the host was almost was tending to get teary eye because oh she's a woman host and this has changed for like like what who gives a crap you're up there you know you're up there in a dress right you know they're like we want to be respected they're half-naked all these women right their cleavage showing and they're like we want to be respected yeah I fully respect women right this is the mica sure they want to convince women out there empower women that being a mom is here response what being a mother isn't a job it's a chore right like all these lifetime he's all these TV shows you want to be a career woman right then a men are sexually harassing even though women are walking we're no clothes right and just men are just as bad I mean men are wearing women's makeup so it's you know the world has pretty much been flipped upside down which is what Satanism is all about but you see those agendas pushed right and how ironic that they're talking about the Felucia how ironic that they're disgusting is I just covered it now I'm not saying oh they saw my bit of course not of course not but what I did say in the video I did about the flu shot is that at a certain time okay every year they call on certain things now when they plan these usually these shootings right a lot of times you'll see January February you'll see the fall you'll spring let's see one every season right and some people yeah I mean you might see one every week at this point they're getting so ridiculous but with the flu it becomes repetition where every news station is talking about the flu over and over and over and you even have Hollywood doing it right now they're not they're doing this in a different way they're not going get your flu shot you could die right there's just planting seeds in people's heads who have seen all of this stuff on TV about how people are dying from the flu and then they're using humour and saying things like oh you're welcome it's free it cost us $50,000 remember if the government's giving anything away for free that's a red flag okay there they only give things away for free if they're going to poison and kill you with it think about what the government gives money for free right in Canada they give away free abortion pills America they give away free flu shots soon of course in America they'll give away free abortion pills because that's just how it works so I plan hip Parenthood and all that stuff this is all satanic this is all part of child sacrifice and you can even see the celebrities Melissa I didn't call Matt I mean these are the Hollywood celebrities are the biggest losers on the planet and I say that and people back oh yeah I get messages all the time people like you're so jealous and stuff like that you know I'm on my second channel here at 400,000 subscribers I have 400,000 subscribers in a year pretty I could care less about popularity long if I wanted to be famous I'd show my face in the channel I try to go on shows like Infowars and fox news I would play the ref left-right paradigm no interest okay people just seem to be drawn to the channel because there's people who are waking up and understand this stuff's real and I'm making sense of things so they get it but celebrities are literally the biggest losers on the planet because they're forced into the spotlight none of these people are liked without being forced to be like right the TV constantly tells you to like them to love them so and so's funny this shows funny this song is great this movie is great right there are literally losers and that's one of the reasons they can't stand platforms like YouTube so much and like I said earlier white guys like Jack Black and they're pushing all of these celebrities Will Smith onto YouTube because these people are realizing that nobody really likes summer cares they get made fun of left and right now these people are actually getting trolled they don't even need to know how to deal with getting trolled right I mean all youtubers know how to deal with getting chill for the most part because we all get trolled whether you like me or you don't like me or I don't like you which you know it's part of being on here but they're throwing these people over because they can't get enough for the limelight and you get all these losers now talking about the flu shot right what a big coin sets free flu shots for all the celebrities and they're all laughing it up in the crowd because they know exactly what it is remember these people are all initiated in the same secret societies starting with Freemasonry okay and not every one of them is a freemason as some of them are born into covens or cults which are way higher up than Freemasonry but most people go through Freemasonry they navigate through they get into other cults they network and that's how all this stuff works but they all know the same stuff they're all told the same agendas that's why Hollywood's pushing me to left and right right all of these guys who take the bullet you know for the me2 thing guys coming out getting attacked and instead of wanting to go to court over any of this stuff or just coming forward and going okay I quit my job and now I will make any money no you don't see any of these celebrities defending themselves and saying prove that I hit on you and creeped you out at 1975 you know Dustin Hoffman I mean the list goes on or some of these guys if actually Google some of the people who have been called out in this entire scam right none of them want a fair trial another one ain't it they just lay down under the bus because I'm you know what I mean like wouldn't you defend it would you even remember if you hit on someone 30 years ago I mean think about it right but that's how it works they all do what's in the betterment to reach the New World Order that's part of the secret societies and their goals the New World Order is the ultimate goal whatever has to be done they all take an oath a vow of silence and then they're all part of the same Brotherhood men and women through Eastern star through D Malee's you know they grow up through it rainbow girls jobs daughters and this is where we get to write working together for their one cause which you know it's all under the all-seeing eye of Lucifer who they worship so here they are pushing the flu shot folks just like I said a couple days ago you're good as I see it turn up now for a couple weeks all right and crack a joke about oh if you're somebody who's anti vaccination just put a cloth over your head you know what I mean right like that sense of subliminal mind control for people out there who are watching it who are like I don't know if I should get my kids vaccinate to make them feel like losers like they should get a vaccine right because all the celebrities do it even though it's a comedy skit that's how mind control works it's a total joke just like the Golden Globes and just like every loser sitting in this room at the 2019 Golden Globes same things bunch of puppet nobodies who wouldn't be anything if they didn't you know bow their soul to Satan not that any of us are anything anyway we're all God's children all right but I'm saying it from the standpoint of the mindset of them like there's somebody's in today's world they're nothing but garbage and filth and trash don't look up to anybody on this earth okay look up to God read the Bible look up to God's Word not man's word and stop admiring these absolute losers who aren't funny who aren't entertaining who think they are and people think that they're funny because they're told that they're funny these people would be do these people would literally be scrubbing our toilets with their tongues if they weren't a part of these secret societies okay and that's where they should be I thank you for listening to today's show god bless all of you and your families"

-1,taken me a while to bring myself to do intensely angry so I'm probably going to take it away blondie hi my name is Shanna and we are a vaccine free family people make fun of the idea of I can't even but I seriously can't even right now it would be so easy to just sit here and run for ages making all the points I want to make throughout this video based on this one simple statement what I want I'll be a good sick I wasn't always going to not vaccinate in fact my husband is a chiropractor oh peddler brilliantly you can't cure a disease by cracking your back sorry not a fan of nonsense pretending to be medicine it's kind of one of my triggers I guess and when we were pregnant or when I was pregnant I had this trump card that I played that said basically I'm the mom and I get to decide because well as an idiot it's not like you don't already have all the rights towards your child but you want to shut your husband out of any decisions to boot so he was grow some bald man parenthood should be a partnership not you being your wife read a book and it was at the time a book called the sanctity of blood by dr. I'm going to buy a book for the sake of this video I ain't that rich yet but if someone can get me a copy perhaps I'll make a little review of it it's full title is the sanctity of human a vaccination is not immunization however title screens volumes of the direction the author is most likely going and at that time I couldn't find it but I knew where he was going he wanted me to at least look into his his feelings on the situation because you know feelings are more important than objective reality especially the feelings of someone in such a renowned profession so while shopping one day in a whole type of market with Whole Foods and books and whatnot I came across a book called the vaccine safety manual and another book I looked up a couple of the author Neil Z Miller's books and noticed something interesting he seems to like putting a foreword in from someone was an actual degree but doesn't appear to have any himself very interesting and I'm a researcher and I may not be a researcher by career but I'm a researcher on life oh well forgive me I didn't realize we had the great researcher random soccer mum in our presence do go on if I'm going to research a car I'm going to know everything about that car before I purchase it if I research a vaccine I want to know why or why not I would be doing it or not oh my god you are a things are in any way comparable is just things that you just aren't going to be able to be all that qualified to judge the bust and I mean vast amount of research that has gone into vaccines would take lifetimes that's life times plural to get through and more and more research is being done as we speak the consensus that vaccines are a good idea and this is some people with actual medical degrees is overwhelmingly in favor I think that's a good bet but what do I know I'm not super with wife of Cairo practice soccer mom researcher and so I found this book what I liked about it was that it was unbiased bollocks from the book I began studying medical and scientific journals the data was just been evidence showed that vaccines are often unsafe and ineffective yet no word means and I didn't want somebody on a pro side to tell me why I needed to do it and I didn't want somebody on an anti side tell me why I shouldn't do it I just wanted to know what it was about so you with a belly sticking out to hear that basically walk into a room before I did and I open this book up and the first thing I saw was these are vaccines these are what they're supposed to do for the body this is what they're made of and this is why they put these ingredients into it and then at the end of each section was the situations that happen to people that have taken these vaccines so whether it's an injury or just a damage I'll say so stories some could have happened things that may have been related to this battle the other not studies not empirical data brilliant sounds super unbiased babe Edie a damage I'll say it was listed at the end of each chapter and I was shocked I was shocked that very basic immunity building things that I've been told were causing harm well that's what these anti facts books are supposed to do they work on your emotions they make you sad angry or shocked because feelings are much easier to understand and hard data unfortunately when dealing with something as important as vaccinations and not to be hyperbolic but the millions of people your feelings need to be thrown out of the goddamned window now my father passed away of leukemia and he was an older gentleman but that that changed me for life and so when I looked at some of these vaccines and I saw side effects were leukemia never heard that one before and I can't seem to find any information even hinting at a link between vaccines and cancer is this another one of those made-up ones like autism because one person one time had a vaccine and then was diagnosed with leukemia so vaccines totally caused it because that science and staff or when I was learning about disease in itself and I learned that that's one of the number one killers I should say for children under the age of eight I thought there's a correlation to this again more information that I can't seem to find maybe Google is hiding the truth of me or maybe that book and you are full of market at however many months pregnant I think it was close to nine months and I just started reading from the front cover and I turned page after page after page we to the shop not a live movie where the Bible believe it oh and to be honest with you I wept I cried for these women for these fathers for these mothers I wasn't even really a mom yet but you certainly were very easily emotionally manipulated by stories stories that you couldn't verify and also have no bearing on reality regardless but I was carrying a life inside me and I was responsible I'm responsible for everything that this child is going to be doing in life it's my job it's my job to be the voice and it's also my job to the caregiver and that was my first step into I may not not vaccinate but I'm certainly not going to jump into the hospital and vaccinate being emotionally unstable is always a great place to make important life decisions from soft me and that's where it started and we went to the hospital when I was delivering and the doctors came in and I said I'm not getting the vitamin K shot they immediately start to tell me then your child's brain is going to bleed to death and that's not the case and in some sense instances that may happen to a child but that's not the regular case well I'm pretty sure they didn't say that I imagine it was more could and you're just being hyperbolic but still it will be far more without the I thought you cretins liked vitamins anyway of all the things to not get that seems like a really silly one even by upset me and a new mom with all my hormones going and the lack of sleep and this newness of this child that I'm going to be leaving the hospital with any minute now and I can't believe they're letting me take her with me it was the feeling that came over me as so you're not for me raising my child you're for me being a woman of fear no children and understanding the risks they aren't trying to make your life worse they are trying to make your life better the only people trying to instill fear in others are people like you and the my husband was right beside me said ok thank you and the woman walked out so fast forward a little bit I get home and we decided I'm going to look more into it because I don't want to be foolish in my decision I want to be smart presented without comment and I started getting every book and every article that I could find that supported you'll presuppose conclusion and then I asked piers I at the time was going to school for nutrition and I was amongst many doctors all the time in my schooling nutritional school what are the chances that that was some Institute of Wuan nonsense after all that has been said considering your lack of knowledge and personal credentials because let's be clear you would have mentioned them were surrounded by doctors of any sort let alone medical professionals and I would go to them and I would say you know do you have sources do you have education for me that I can look at that I can read that I can make my own decisions and I got hooked well I bet it was more of the same biased wound nonsense but even if you did read actual peer-reviewed papers from well-respected journals you don't strike me as someone who read them properly or understood them what upset me was also being a new mom you want support around you and being that we have social media everywhere I went onto a site and there's a plethora of groups for moms and moms to be and and parenting and what kind of parent do you want to be and the majority of what I found was kids were being drugged up across the board if they have a fever you don't just give them acetaminophen or ibuprofen now you make a cocktail and you give them both at separate hours and you can get away with that and I like the accusation there yes you can do that because they don't really react with each other and it gives the child a more constant pain relief that way they cocktail it's two over-the-counter very safe medicines when used correctly that decades stop trying to use buzzwords to have colic you're giving them you know prescription medication drugs that were never intended for kids there's no such thing as intended to kids or anyone really when new drugs are discovered they can be found to have uses beyond their original purpose studies and testing show a variety of doses that can have benefits for all sorts of people at that age but it's been okay well you can give it to them and they're not getting better and it leads them from one thing to the next to the next so it starts out with colic and then it moves on to stomach issues and then it moves on to you know the next thing down the road and then these kids are just consistently drugged cool story bro needs more dragon we can't blame the disease because they've always been here and they're always going to be here eradicated smallpox window pest global eradication underway polio Drakken colitis yours malaria regional elimination established or underway hookworm lymphatic filariasis measles rubella on cosec Isis quick belt Yakult disease rabies you ourselves you will have to blame yourself if God forbid your child catches something that you could have prevented if you didn't think for smarter than people who spend their tiny aspect of it because there is just couldn't learn everything about this if you lived multiple lifetimes there was just that much information on it so for you to sit there and pretend you know better than doctors and scientists is is four I can't blame her so instead I had to look in the mirror at myself what am I going to do for my child to raise her up in the way that she should go and in the way that she should go as a way of help Jesus Christ you are a terrible speaker to boot so in our home we proactively do preventive care we do whole food supplements we eat beets we choose organic foods we choose Whole Foods nothing like a big pile of beets toward of necrotizing fasciitis we have very little refined sugar if at all we didn't do the one year birthday cake it let the child eat all they want to and we didn't have any cake we have fruit look I think we all just have to understand she's just better than us her kids are going to grow up to be the true uberman and destroy us all first God's candy so that's what we do in our family actually God's candy is Toblerone he told me their self and it's worked our child for oh well if one child makes it before Sam's back things that's evidence enough of me pack it up people what I need to science anymore wait you break and she's had a couple of the small child childhood illnesses like roseola but when those things come along I know you had me convinced they would be illness proof we've done all that we can preventive you really haven't and then we go into how can we care for our child during so when she gets a fever I don't give a ride your profile because fevers are there for a reason so instead we use homeopathy I'll of course you tool that you use when you're gullible charlatans trying to take your money instead of doctors trying to save your life getting over its own illnesses it's not there to mask it and it's not there to fix it well of course it's not there to it's there to protect preserve the body and to promote healing and that's what we do and every time our a fever or an illness or cold is run through our family we're stronger for it and I can see a developmental growth in my child good for you now what if your kid catches something and comes into contact with an immunocompromised child that was incapable of surviving many of the things we vaccinate for see that's what about the whole anti-vaxxer movement I wouldn't really care if they did it to whatever it boils my pissed when they inflict it on their kids but ultimately it is their decision but the fact that it also affects people around you can cause mass outbreaks just because you don't understand science or trust your that makes me I'm greedy I can see her speaking better I can see her her her growth and her weight they add into her life and that to me those are real results that is is real credibility right there confirmation bias is the only real evidence I need I wasn't always that person I wasn't always that person that was going to not vaccinate I assume you hit your head really hard since then but it has to start somewhere and we have to make the decision to always take one step forward in the proper direction and if you go down a road you are literally taking leaps and bounds backwards and taking the rest of society with you follow the road and see where it leads and it usually seems to be that only when a child is injured through the parents then realize it wasn't the best choice for their family I really would like it moved to an island with all the things they could ever need but actual medicine poison around and just see how long they last before it becomes a zombie apocalypse I give it ten years maybe drop a few vials of those eradicated or new eradicated diseases that they don't need vaccines from I mean seriously ladies and polio or to make it look like a pretty convincing zombie movie nobody wants to play Russian roulette and in a sense unless you know for sure that your child will be 100% safe do you want to play that game yes because I would rather do something and have a tiny chance of some fairly mild complication then do nothing and have a higher chance of them ending up dead if you can't say yes right now pause this is Klara she's four years old and she is my vaccine free child she is the epitome of love affection and understanding and health as much as I I truly hope Klara never catches any of the diseases you could have protected her from by simply trusting people who have worked their whole lives in order to make the world a little bit of a better place there are so many of this kind of video on this one channel so expect to see more I'll leave a link if anyone else responds to another one of these head cases please Chuck me a link I

America you guys know why we are here I'm not cool with being racist at all but you shouldn't be fired for it because that's like being fired for being jailed black or Mexican or anything like that it's all wrong but it still happens I'm pretty happy to live in a world where blatant racism gets you fired wait what what being black is who you are being gay is who you are being a racist swamped West is an ignorant choice let's play 13 reasons why if I say no then you haven't heard me if I say welcome to your tape then you had to figure out what you've done to me comment your name I didn't you respond to my happy birthday message I left on your timeline I was just wondering cuz you responded to other people but not me just seems weird long I had a lot of my wall the ones I responded to were the ones I had time to before I went out for lunch with my family I've been busy today it's gonna respond to all of them eventually uh-huh sorry hmm well if I'm being honest that just seems like a lame excuse most of the ones you replied to were from guys and so it kind of looks like you're picking and choosing based on popularity and how hot they are dude chill chill I'm perfectly calm actually just trying to get some closure to the clear ignorant I was issued the majority of the bday messages I responded to early in the day from family and close friends some of which happen to be guys that's not my fault and why does it matter pathetic if you take an online birthday message so seriously come on and they need to add that I would have eventually responded to yours but I do have a life outside of social media and on my birthday it's kind of hard to keep up with it when I'm doing stuff with my family and friends you actually make yourself come across as a weirdo doing this I care because I took the time out of my life I have a life as well considering I come from a well-off family and attend social events and parties pretty much all week but I took time away to wish a pretty girl happy birthday would have been nice to get a thank you at least but not a low guess all your girls are just the same have to be a great looking athlete to get like whatever thanks for the birthday message now go away earth is not flat vaccines work we've been to the moon chemtrails aren't a thing climate change is real stand up for science Luigi stated this man as for me it's like wearing a sign that says shoot me please it's sad that we live in a world where having a shirt like that can be considered controversial another one this has got to stop I think it's the left paying people off to do horrible things involving guns yeah because we want to see people get shot to take away your ass all right not at all I got pregnant on purpose so my committed phobic boyfriend would propose three years later and we have two beautiful kids and we are happy he has Jesus this is what it looks like when your two-year-old gets ahold of a palpable of Cologne and drinks it glazed eyes a little loopy no need for you wait wait Little Italy no need for their kids do not do the a nice lush long thing going around just as I warned about the ice bucket challenge you think it's innocent it is not I get a huge check in my spirit with these things two nights ago I saw the earth and it was being covered in a black ooze goo very dark or these act rituals are these acts calling something remember the key of Salomon could it be a tone power and Prince Attalla teased people don't be programmed to follow the masses stand apart and say centered trusting God all of this is a prelude so why you're saying is for every Proust I that I'm lazy if you can't credit properly when possible don't post it at all it's America dude Jesus Christ what the hell are you talking about I'm telling me that you shouldn't have posted the picture at all if you don't give credit no need to give a speech about how your country is so free that you can be an ignorant person and ignore everybody that's exactly what I'm telling you it's my freedom here the Donald Trump does it all the time look at that monster now America and China are doing better enough princess South Korea relations is better than ever I going on about what about the word relevancy was he vaccine injured yes but the mainstream media denies it urgent warning there is a black Jeep Cherokee that drove down a dead-end street and turn around and drove back out and they don't live in the streets I was sitting in my driveway and they drove by real slow okay does anyone else giggle when you're sitting in a place like a little clinic husband is getting his dot physical and look at your kids and they're not unvaccinated and nobody knows no when they I've found out that my kids weren't vaccinated they all went in put masks on I just think it's comical like huh look at my kids spreading diseases and they don't even know why I'm so childish please be satirical please I don't know if it is masturbation is a homosexual act here's some real science to back up the obvious correlation between masturbation of being gay homosexuality percentage number of masturbation's a briefing blacks have watts gave them even freedom probably hurts some wittle fearless to realize that I'm out god prove me wrong slavery is literally the opposite of freedom how do you even function hell racists do you belong to the clan and who freed blacks from slavery not over blacks we literally gave them everything they need to be more thankful and well behaved why does it hurt mother asked with in my dream last night she was giving birth I did not respond to her I just continued to watch stone-faced push yelled father and she did but mother and I did not break eye contact I knew the answer I knew that God made childbirth painful as punishment for Eve since mother already understood this she taught it to me I wonder why she would ask me such a question to test me and my knowledge to see if I would show your motion to see if I would pray suddenly by her work in a cold sweat mine racing immediately put on my shirt and took this picture my d/f traded a line of coke for a tattoo with my name on it wish he wasn't in jail so I could see it relationshipgoals all right hi there please help ASAP I'm looking after my friend six-year-old for a few days he had every vaccination and he has been diagnosed with autism to the point he's

-1,hello hello and welcome welcome calm down it's okay you're in safe hands this is the afterlife yes exactly how your mind perceives it am i you are intelligent aren't you you perceive that you've died that's right you were born you lived and now you've died and you're in the weigh station this is where you come to be reincarnated and sent back to the world in a new body a new life with new hopes you want to know how you died oh well that's not that hard to figure out let's take a look shall we very good well it says right here reason for death complications from polio you died from the disease polio because you weren't vaccinated you contracted polio and then your heart was crushed because you couldn't breathe when your iron lung went out due to a power shortage and the emergency generator didn't kick on because the mechanic didn't put fuels in it so you died from complications of polio well I understand you never know what's going to happen to you in the life that you lead but in your next one you get a whole new chance to live a new life with myriad amount possibilities are you ready to go back very good very good sign right here and we'll get you right back right away

little bit of a rash going on down there on the planet burthen we're having a influx of new clientele a few who shall say well very good I hope you enjoy your new life and until I see you again ah hello and welcome you are in the afterlife you've died that's right and this is how your mind perceives the afterlife come in come in you're more than welcome here all who die and pass on are welcome here this is the weigh station this is where you will be reincarnated and start life anew yes how did you die let me take a look at the paperwork you know there's always paperwork even in death yes oh

and a chance to start anew and this is a chance for you to live out all your hopes and dreams are you ready to go back okay good because we have quite a line out there from smallpox which was actually eradicated in 1972 but it's making a comeback in the worst way so if you don't mind signing right here whoa oh really you weren't vaccinated for rubella I've never heard of such a thing I thought everybody not next name when they were a child okay well these things happen oh oh it was a conscious decision Oh your parents decided it for you okay that makes perfect sense then you were too young to make up this decision on your own but that's okay it's neither here nor there because you have passed and now it's time for you to return are you ready all right until I see you again oh there you are hello welcome welcome you're in safe hands please come in welcome you're in the afterlife this is the wave station that's right you've were born you lived and then you died your mind perceives

always time for any questions you might have before we send you back of course yes we're going to send you back we always do oh how did you die oh it's just a moment you know everybody wants to know that have you ever noticed this kind of a common thing around here everybody wants to know how they died you think they would ask you know with their time to ask a question like what can I do down there next they always want to know how did I do they it's quick quite comical just like I really get a kick out of it myself it's us right here you died from lockjaw you weren't vaccinated and you stepped on a nail and you got lockjaw you got that you didn't get a tetanus shot when you were a child you didn't get your boosters oh you were part of the anti-vaxxer movement I've never heard of this it's quite interesting no not really well it says right here you stepped on a nail and then you died that's what happened to you you you stepped on a nail and you didn't have any antibodies to fight off the virus for tetanus and then you died you were playing with a ball and you stepped on a nail and then you later died so you've got to start all over again so you do understand that don't you okay well that's that's that's all right these things happen comes to the best of us I had a lady appear yesterday he stepped out in front of a car it's the pollen from a car in the middle of traffic that was it she was no more no okay so if you don't mind signing right here we as we are in a hurry we have a lot of whooping cough coming in and we've got to get you back there as soon as possible lots of drooping cough yes it's a very preventable disease but oh you you don't have the you didn't give back staining for whooping cough either really so you just took a chance on not getting whooping cough and dying we're going blind or something or going deaf or something okay that's good okay well everybody has their own political agendas that's right okay well hmm be it from me to question you on your ethics I'll send you back down we've got to get to the next person has quite a few whopping costs in the queue bon voyage have fun with your new life ah back again so soon don't I know you you you just died from the tetanus and then night I sent you back you hurt you here again already oh you got the you got the plague Oh didn't you get inoculated for the plague where you were going you got the plague the plagues like they don't even get the plague anymore they've it's like practically eradicated how did you get the plague oh you you weren't vaccinated Oh our vaccinations are causing plague now Oh hmm that's interesting so that's the mentality so if you take it you'll get it so don't take it oh okay well we're really backed up today so I want you to go stand over there with the people with rubella whooping cough chickenpox and the the the the men who continually feel the need to piss in a light socket and stop their heartbeat could you please stand over there it's a quite hot in here today I'm sweating profusely the workloads terrible so we can just go over there and them let me get to the next person while you're over there waiting and what in Christ's name are you doing here there two days ago what did you die from now what didn't you get vaccinated what the hell are you two related what what is going on here this is supposed to be a calming relaxing then fruitful situation you're making me very very tense for Dave they what hepatitis A you get an inoculation you don't get hepatitis A what the hell's matter with you well you have a right you have right it's correct everybody has rights they have rights too that's why they're standing over there in the corner with Jim Carrey he's he's funny but I don't I don't think I'd go to him for cancer research you know I mean Jerry Lewis was good at raising money for you know Jerry's kids but I don't think I would take any medical advice from Jerry Lewis do you see that do you see the disconnect here well you go over there and stand with him okay cuz I've had about all I can take today whooping cough rubella we have to get through the people who died just from mass gun shootings and getting run over by buses by heretics we don't have time I feel all tingly I don't know what it is I feel like I'm in a looping video or something and it's meant to cause me to have sensations that tingle into my brain maybe I'm having a stroke or something no it's not from being inoculated there's nothing wrong with my brain just stand over there I'm gonna send you all to an island maybe that'll straighten this whole problem out now here just sign sign right here who cares just put an X what does it matter you next whooping cough you two get over there okay stop stop timeout okay whooping cough okay you you you you you over there right now you're done you're done I'm gonna keep you up here maybe if I make an employee out of you I'll send the rest down and maybe we get done with this malarkey this silliness well if you had a rutabaga growing out of your head would you take a shot for that to prevent that anti sex or my ass please come in yeah you're dead you died that's right how did you die self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head Oh finally somebody normal oh well you know you shouldn't have been pointing it at yourself when you were cleaning that pistol you should have checked to make sure it was empty I know I know still it's always good to have someone like you here but kind of lighten up the mood as it is mm-hmm oh you're standing watch over a vaccination hot spot Wow all the protesters you were holding them back and then the gun accidentally discharged under your chin when you were trying to hold off the anti-vaxxers at a protest meeting oh yeah that's why we have that big line behind you that's terrible oh don't worry we're gonna get you a good spot yes you are Ted you lived you kind of had a nice life and then you got killed by a protester who shoved your gun under your jaw when you lost your mind and wanted to kill the anti-vaccine I understand it is a quite common most of my co-workers now are the same thing they I think it was a mistake to put them on the payroll here but I was hoping if I quit sending them back there that we could halt some of this movement but it seems to have backfired they're spreading their propaganda into everybody they send it was a terrible mistake now everybody thinks they're going to get the disease if they get the inoculation they keep bringing up some photograph of people with cows growing out of their head i it's right here it's a very famous painting illustration and if you ever seen it before yes such a nice man I I get so few people like you mm-hmm used to be the time you would get the elderly you know they just there they died in their sleep and you had to explain the afterlife and reincarnation to them but now it's just this uh this loop of Complete Idiot's coming up and going right back and refusing to get inoculated for something like smallpox it they eradicated smallpox at one time but it's back because these people would rather have pimply pimply skin all over their face then live I don't know I have thought about retirement but I just I don't know what to do anymore you know I fill out the paperwork I turn in everybody's w-2s you know I do their taxes I try to get along you know I try to get along his sign right here and you know generally I think I'm a good spirit of the afterlife but then I come across somebody who would rather you know kill somebody with a protest sign to keep them from giving their child a polio vaccination and I think oh well there you go again there you go again it's just like sometimes I just think you're better off dead don't you think so I do it it's funny but all joking aside there are so many facts and figures we could look at but I really wanted to try to point out to people that there is a thing called herd mentality that protects us with the use of inoculations from these deadly diseases but there's also a herd mentality that likes to enter the population through stupid pseudoscience and half facts and this herd mentality that prevents people from looking up the facts and statistics and the graphs themselves it prevents them from making logical statements but statements of emotion statements from the heart there's a lot of discredited and slanted science out there people with agendas they need these agendas to pay their bills and that's what they're up to so don't be fooled by snake oil salesmen are charlatans or pyramid schemes if it's too good to be true or it's too silly to be true or it doesn't even make sense or it would take way too many people to keep the conspiracy going it's probably a false story it's probably not real it's probably just some made-up conspiracy to frighten people so they can't sleep at night I personally sleep very well because I got the polio vaccine of course I got run over by a cement truck when I was walking across the street because my arm hurt and and I was looking the wrong way and I saw this woman and she had a pencil skirt on that buttoned up the front and she dropped her purse and she bent over so gingerly to to get it and mm-hmm I couldn't take my eyes off of her figure she was a striking drink of water and I went over to see if I could watch my thirst and of course I got run over by that cement truck and the last thing I saw of the mortal coil as the breath of life left my body was our screaming as my eyeball shot completely out of my head and one of them landed in her mouth it was quite grisly of course after that I was completely dead as we all are in the afterlife we're all dead but some of us are dead from here down anti-vaxxers I'm afraid our dead from here up don't you just love politics in a relaxation setting I do it's just sometimes fun to make people laugh I had to do it call me a prude but I'll go with science any day a week we're going to send you back to gay Paree where they still do inoculations and the guillotine everybody that doesn't get one that's right they just cut their head off and cut out the middleman it's quite easy that way they have a huge wood chipper and it actually works quite well their fields are very fertile so would you like to go to gay Paree maybe you could be an artist down in front of the Eiffel Tower sipping wine and eating a baguette some good okay bye bye have a good life have a most
-1,"This past weekend, hundreds of anti-vaxxers
 descended upon Washington state to rally against a proposed bill that would make vaccines in
 the state mandatory. Basically, what it would do is it would take
 away parent's right to be conscientious objectors and not have their children vaccinated. They couldn't do that anymore. The state would vaccinate their children is
 actually similar legislation in California and more legislation kind of spreading throughout
 the United States. And do you know what else is spreading throughout
 the United States right now, especially up there in Washington, measles, a disease that
 we had essentially eradicated decades ago is making a comeback at least 52 confirmed
 cases in Washington alone and dozens more suspected of this disease that can be fatal,
 particularly in infants, toddlers, and the elderly or people with weakened immune systems
 and Dhea. Know why it's making a comeback because of
 these anti vaccs parents. Let's get something 100 percent straight. Okay? Vaccines do not cause autism. There is no link between the two. The one nude, the one doctor who made that
 link was later found to have completely falsified his data, was stripped of his medical license
 and is now the subject of ridicule for the rest of his life because he lied about the
 link between vaccines and autism. It does not exist and I have seen so many
 wonderful people on social media in the last few days make this point and this to me is
 probably the best point out there about this issue. Why is a dead kid or a kid with a disease
 that was easily preventable? Why is that better than having a kid with
 autism? Why are we acting like autism is some kind
 of death sentence or some kind of social stigma that we need to look upon these people and
 say, oh my God, how horrible for you. Your life must suck in every possible way. That's not at all how it is. Autistic people have the same odds as the
 rest of us have growing up to be high functioning, normal, productive members of society, and
 yet we're treating this as something that's just as deadly or as awful as having a child
 die from a preventable disease. That to me, honestly is one of the most disgusting
 things out there, but I also have to issue more statements here about the anti vaccs
 crowd. There is no science on your side. It doesn't exist and I have taken many courses
 just in autism over the years. A while pursuing a master's degree in in cognitive
 neuroscience. I actually did a lot of studies in courses
 and wrote tons of papers about autism itself, so I'm no expert, but I do know a lot about
 this particular issue. Do you know why the diagnoses of autism increased
 over the years? Especially recently? It's because we actually have a better understanding
 of what to identify. You know, 50 years ago we didn't have that
 so kids could be autistic. They wouldn't necessarily be diagnosed because
 psychologists at the time didn't know what to diagnose it as the criteria did not exist. It does today, that's why there's an increase
 in it, not because more people have developed autism, but because we as a society, as doctors
 have gotten better at identifying it and being able to put it on that spectrum. A spectrum that didn't exist 50 years ago. Very basic reading on the issue. We'll give you this information. Okay. It's not like some of us have access to private
 collections of books that tell us the truth. This is all readily available out there, but
 these parents, these anti vaccine people choose to live in darkness. They choose to deny science the same way we
 ridicule people who deny the existence of climate change. That's what this is. It is the same level of science deniers among
 these anti-vaxxers as we see amongst the climate change deniers. There is no difference in my opinion between
 the two of them and yeah, I know we got a lot of prominent environmentalist's out there
 who were a part of the anti vaccine movement and they're wrong and I have no problem saying
 that the wrong. The science is not on their side and they're
 actively denying the science that does exist by coming out there and telling us that vaccines
 are dangerous. I suggest these people look into myelination
 of the nerves in the brain during development and see how that effects the increase chances
 of autism. Then go through and look and see if anything
 in these vaccines is going to affect myelination of the brain because it won't because most
 of that actually happens in utero before these vaccines or even administered. They're denying the basic science. They're not doing the basic research and they
 are all wrong and they're putting us at risk. They are bringing back diseases that we had
 essentially said goodbye to decades ago because they are leading their whole crusade based
 solely on a report from a guy who completely fabricated everything in his study. Not exactly what you want to build a movement
 on. Not exactly a sturdy foundation, but the facts
 don't seem to matter to any of these anti vaccine people that rallied this past weekend
 or that live all throughout this country and are saying, you know what? I don't care if my kid dies of a disease that
 could have been prevented because everybody knows that's a hell of a lot better than having
 a kid on the autism spectrum. This is disgusting, and these parents, these
 people out there telling us not to get vaccinated because the kids might catch autism. They're probably the lowest of the low in
 American society right now."

hate when people try and make the whole like vaccinate your kids thing into an attack of personal freedoms you are legally not allowed to murder someone so why should you legally be allowed to put your kids life in danger and not only that other kids lives you just shouldn't be able to do it it's child abuse to put your kid in danger and by not vaccinating your child you're putting them in danger vaccinate Christ so I'm gonna actually blur out the top of this image because it's it's a child's face and it's measles and it's actually quite hard to look at CDC muttering measles outbreak in 21 states including Michigan please do vaccinate I don't want my kids getting the measles that vaccines work today at Walmart I told my catchy Merry Christmas she said Happy Holidays ma'am I smiled

-1,anti-vaxxers and flat-earthers are two sides of the same coin desire to be special or smarter than the experts however flat earthers are mainly just a joke a fun group to make fun of because they believe something downright ridiculous and it's harmless it doesn't and believe these things they can believe Xenu powers boners from a cosmic plane above us it doesn't matter that doesn't hurt anyone anti-vaxxers hurt everyone on a global scale and this cult has some pretty powerful leaders in the youtube community I wanted to just watch one of the anti-vaxxer Ito's here and just make fun of it just because I think anti-vaxxers a group that needs to be constantly ridiculed to help maybe push people away from pursuing that kind of some anti vaccine hi my name is Ennis Miguel I got two children and we were wrecked Pro vaccines and then one of my children got damaged by a vaccine when when that child was four months old now you meet our protagonist here anus his name is anus and it'd be an extremely poor taste and very low for me to make fun of his name being anus but it's auntie vac so there's nothing too he's an anti-vaxxer that's perfect that's a beautiful marriage right there now anus tells a story here and there's some inconsistencies with it that don't make much sense so it makes me believe that the story's a not true or be completely exaggerated so honestly I a story continues he's telling this on a that now Larry cook is a goddamn anti-vaxxer Empire this man is fighting vaccinations tooth and nail he would literally be biting the necks of vaccinated children and sucking the vaccines out of them that is the kind of we had to turn to alternative medicine and then we realized our other child that was developing food allergies very rapidly and we realized he had a lot of toxins build up in his body a little pro tip when you hear someone say that your body is toxic or that you're building up toxins or something you got to detox it rub these essential oils on your nipples that is the most profitable bud buzzword toxins toxic detoxing all forms of that it's usually just trying to sell you something scam you or just show how was building up allergies and eczema and and asthma and all these other issues was it attributed to these vaccines that we gave him when he was little and when we saw the issue happen to our daughter we realized that wack scenes are not safe they have a lot of side effects and we held off vaccinating from that day onwards the word research means anus you did no research you went on Facebook and you found some anti VAX you started buying their merch repping their swag and believing their absolute facts should have never spread nor should Flat Earth but because of how easy it is to find anything you want you can find any information at all that confirms your personal beliefs no matter how outrageous you could find something that says Santa Claus does exist and he's a notoriously disgusting sex fiend bending them over the toys you could find anything about anything except you don't look for anything credible you just look for anything tangible anything you can see on Facebook you take as the truth instead of looking at actual that's what you found anus you didn't do research you just wasted some time on is the knowledge of my twitch streaming twitch.tv slash moist critical come check it out i stream daily it's a lot of fun I'd love to see you there now he's reduced to stage after we detox to him after we gave him a lot of green juicing organic foods and we we make all his foods from scratch at home his reach the stage now where he can be in a public setting he can go to public school thank God Whole Foods did it again they save the child's life do you hear that the juicing the pre digestible vegan healing vitamin nutrient chakra bars they were feeding him all of it solved all of his problems and it made him 6 feet tall when he was only 4 years nothing for your child if that's actually how you tackle those problems that did literally nothing you may as well have just rub dirt in his face the vaccine laws in New Jersey were pretty strict we could not get an exemption for him to be able to attend a regular school so we decided to move to California 5 years ago and we were able to make him attend school because we were able to get the exemption yeah vaccine exemption form is something that should not exist anywhere that's like having a form that allows a child to bring a time bomb to school because that's what your child is when he's not disease and illness it's downright inhumane to even allow children to go to school unvaccinated it just puts them and other people in danger so a vaccine exemption form should not exist in any capacity we do not vaccinate right now one of the main reasons is my kids we want to maintain a toxic free environment in their body and whenever the toxin levels raises in my child we start seeing all these manifestations of food allergies and so forth a toxic free body huh as you choose alternative probably has you digging in the backyard for soil and mixing it with dog urine and a blender for your power smoothies when we're not concerned about these illnesses because in the past he had he had severe coughing he had severe throat infections he had fevers that we were able to encounter and resolve using alternative therapies and he was able to recover safely so it's totally clear at this point that anus is thrown out science in favor of smoothies he's you know we treated our sons severe cough and all these other bad things with alternative methods that are proven not to work so now opposing vaccines is awful but completely throwing out medicine entirely is even worse anus this is kind of how all anti-vaxxers think though that science is a cult they believe that science has brainwashed people and that science is wrong and yet these people idiots would have been dead 20 years ago had they not been saved by modern medicine advances and societal advances in that department the toxins and the chemicals that are in vaccines we need to make sure that we keep his body clear of toxins I also oppose mandatory vaccinations because there is no fear or there's no outbreak out there that grants or warrants us having all these people given all these shots yeah and you know the story and measles outbreak no need to get into that because you're all well aware that there are outbreaks of extinct diseases coming back because they make me very upset so do your part insult the anti-vaccine hopes that perhaps people that were susceptible to this call like mentality don't go down that dark path and remember you or your family if you're an anti-vaxxer just because you doesn't mean you're smarter than the do research and advance in the field your Facebook group is not that smart and that's kind of the takeaway here youtube they do monetize all anti-vaccine so I respect that I think that's actually a nice little move from them so you did a good thing for once YouTube I like that that's it so yeah
-1,non-vaccinated kids on their third birthday unable to connect the world anti-vaxxer on their third birthday a Sunday when you see on anti-vaxxers one point five year old son crying midlife crisis 100 active asks kids when their parents ask what they want for their fifth birthday I don't know I didn't think I'd get this far fax the anti-vaccination memes have lasted longer than aunty vaccinated kids herbs green tea dying at three non-vaccinated kid we trying to enjoy these anti backs sleeves even though my mum is Oh auntie facts sir hey I need to see a doc anti-vaxxer mom essential minerals green tea when you decide to vaccinate your child but you catch him doing the fortnight dance when Rajiv axe kid starts coughing chuckles I'm in danger when an anti vac skid says their first word the last word when you're an anti Vance kid and you're about to die but then remember all the memes you helped create always look at the bright side of life when an anti-vaxxer has two kids - to the mall unvaccinated child what is it doc doctor it's nothing really just to kill Captain America comes inside hospital room unvaccinated child level of stress 99% non-vaccinated kids are just speedrunners of the game of life when someone says they won't vaccinate their kid well that just sounds like abortion and extra steps when someone tells an anti-vaxxer to vaccinate their child super good advice anti-vaxxer I wonder what happens if I don't vaccinate my kid kid dies and he vaccine so the doctor's reaction when a parents say they aren't going to vaccinate their newborn kid let's hope they last the night science vaccinate your kids anti-vaxxers don't vaccinate their kids science a me a joke to you parents who refuse to vaccinate their kids their kids saved paplu why aren't we alive mom doesn't vaccinate kids almost dead diseases it's free real estate parents doesn't vaccinate kids immune system am i a joke to you when parents don't vaccinate their children guess I'll die when your parents don't vaccinate you okay get in anti-vaxxer doesn't vaccinate kid 18 years later oh that's right honey we don't have a son when you're a child of an anti fast sir and finally get a vaccination Novak's parents science you
-1,"earlier this month a concerned mother who I'll keep anonymous published a post on Facebook which gained some unexpected attention it was a picture of her son sitting in a hospital bed sick after catching a virus most likely from school she explained that he suffers from a health condition which renders him unable to be vaccinated in the post she adamantly demands that all children who are able be vaccinated so that those like her son are safer from infectious disease apparently this is provocative the pro vaccine crowd boosted the post to over six thousand likes in just three days meanwhile anti-vaxxers shared the posts in their private groups and eventually overwhelmed the comment section there were over 20,000 comments in 72 hours I'm not kidding I thought you guys would be interested to explore the comments section and the group's these people came from so let's take a look doesn't VAX her kids and claims anti-vaxxers are all to blame wait what yeah so there's this little thing called being immunocompromised which basically means that your immune system can't handle being vaccinated I've actually been immunocompromised at one point in my life so what that means is that we should all get vaccinated so we can build herd immunity so that those people aren't at risk okay here's a pro vaccine comment of anti-vaxxers are the real biggest they think they know it all and try to change your mind by chanting untruths the person below them says nah bro that's you and I I said the say Bravo that's a that's a perfect comeback I couldn't have come up with something better myself if I tried you sound like you may have been vaccine injured and have some brain damage oh my god you decided you can't vaccinate your children so you blame other parents who decided they can't vaccinate theirs either and tell them it's not their choice shaking my home like why would you say something like that that is ridiculously insensitive oh the original poster said I didn't decide his doctors did I mean I kind of think that this mom has these commenters handled all right let's take a look at some of the groups that these people came from I was able to track some of these down the first group is one where you come and talk to like-minded people and apparently try to use as little actual medicine as possible and follow the recommendations of the people in the group I mean sounds like a strategy for living your life as healthy as possible right my 19 year old son has a parasite and it's down to 170 pounds and that sounds really serious you should probably go to your doctor let's see if anybody says that oh look someone said okay always see a doctor just to be sure that's that's nice someone's a voice of reason in here Oh further up here also enemas organic coffee or colloidal silver enemas just just why No please if you have parasites do not do not put anything into your anus please just why does the coffee have to be organic wait a minute okay so wouldn't non-organic coffee with pesticides actually kill the kill the parasites and your gut better that makes no sense what if they we shouldn't they be due to like oh you should use the worst genetically modified stuff you can with the most roundup as possible and and spray that up the hair and that'll definitely make the parasites out I mean that makes a lot more sense right like why would it be organic coffee oh nice our entire family does a cleanse once a year and here is a an essential oil linked to an essential oil on Amazon you guys know how much I just I just love essential oils right they're just they they're great for everything I mean especially pissing me off does anyone take this cancer survivor' times two at 52 looking for ways to improve my immune system oh my god okay this extract is basically something that's marketed by David avocado Wolfe himself it's from this mushroom which we know from David that apparently mushrooms come from space so it must be great from healthy holistic living sacrificial virgins a must-see film about young girls being severely damaged by HPV Gardasil vaccines Jesus Christ so they are they proposing that this is intentional I mean I know that some people like to propose that apparently the testing ground for vaccines is just the general public like I mean there's not volunteers or anything like that any ideas on pain and my kidneys lemons Jews alright our next one is a parenting group and yeah so they're looking at natural remedies and things for for kids so this is going to be encouraging right at what point do you have to go to the doctors or take medicine for a sinus infection first comment on here I'd have to be near death to go to the doctor Jesus I mean I'm really hoping that you don't end up near death because I wonder whether or not you'd actually go to a doctor at that point that is as truly terrifying this is an apparent group so obviously this person has kids I fear for their safety to say the very least oh my god husband are you still not wearing deodorant me that is correct husband this whole natural thing is going too far our son's head who I was just nursing smells like Bo oops this thing has 425 likes it's one of the most popular posts in this entire group so I guess this is a common experience I I mean you can probably be all natural without smelling right if your ideas about health are making it to where you actually have Bo so badly that's rubbing off on other people you might want to rethink your entire life I feel like our colloidal silver followed by coconut oil tea tree oil treatment isn't working is this getting worse the second photo is the new one yeah so if you rub some random crap on your your sores it's probably gonna get worse maybe talk to someone who is is experienced you know if there were people that went to school for I mean a quarter of like their entire lives and had to constantly be studying about just medical issues and it maybe even had to be licensed to practice medicine so to speak and if you could get there and advice on this that would just be great but unfortunately no people like that even exist right okay now to arguably the worst group in here that any of these anti-vaxxers came from this one is all about seeking quote-unquote natural cures for cancer it has cancer research in the name as well so just bear that in mind while you see some of these posts just warning if you don't want to be intensely sad then just just skip over this part of the video always remember that iodine detox is heavy metals comment on your experience so if I have an anecdote that contradicts yours how do we determine who is right that's the main problem here because um I actually personally have something that's called a liver and that keeps all of the apparent heavy metals that are in all of our diets out of my body and it's worked out really well for me so far you should you should try getting a liver of your own a friend of mine was diagnosed with cancer in her liver she had breast cancer a few years ago she did chemo what can she do I believe she's going to do chemo again it sounds like chemo maybe worked the first time because she doesn't have breast cancer again so I mean it's really even it's it's tough to make jokes about this stuff but seriously let her listen to her doctor don't intrude on that I don't think that advice from a Facebook group is really gonna do a whole lot of good especially when chemo seemed like it worked out the first time what is the importance of apricot seeds fighting with cancer well the most important thing for you to do with apricot seeds when you have cancer is to not rely on them for treatment because they are seeds and your doctor can probably come up with you know a slightly better treatment plan than for you to eat a bunch of seeds oh god here's more for b-17 this is an admin of the thing to seven apricot seeds to almost guarantee a cancer-free life Jesus I mean if someone follows that advice they they'll die that's just horrible here's another thing for b-17 bitter almond tree was banned in America 1995 because it's the highest source of b-17 which prevents and treats cancer still trust your government ok was the bitter almond tree actually banned in America 1995 let's look that a bitter almond tree band let's go to Snopes here it seems like an obvious first thing not that I always trust Snopes bitter almond trees haven't been banned in the United States since 1995 the FDA is only cracked down on people peddling bitter almond derivatives as a cancer cure huh okay we won't check into this I just want to say that while scrolling through this I have noticed a lot a lot of links to articles and YouTube videos that say something like miracle plant kills 98% of cancer cells in 16 hours okay the thing is is that if that actually happened even if the government was suppressing that we would know that so quickly because people would start to use it and the cancer industry would just die out because it'd be so easy to actually get it the government is not coordinated enough to make it to where people literally can't grow plants in their backyards that's absolutely ridiculous that's why we know that no plant is curing cancer out there it's just not possible for that to actually be suppressed like that oh my god all viruses are man-made all viruses have patents what the hell is this we have evidence of ancient viruses that have existed we can look back in our via our DNA and and there's evidence of ancient viruses at work on like any organism that we actually have the ene for just just know this I'm gonna have to call it a day because this is too much okay it's time for me to get on my soapbox because I obviously have a few problems with what we've been looking at first off the terrible ideas and misinformation these people are sharing affects their children I looked at this in the first place because of a Facebook post where people were arguing over the health care of a child now I've heard people say that parents who treat their kids with bogus remedies don't love their children but I don't buy in that I just think they're willfully misguided something I said about faith healing in the past applies here to such a belief system is truly so twisted that it can take the love of a parent for their child and mutate it into actions which lead directly to their child's death as funny and ridiculous as some of these posts may be we have to remember that these issues are sometimes matters of life and death for the most vulnerable people in our lives when parents buy into conspiracy theories surrounding medicine and public health issues they subsequently care for their children less effectively but it doesn't stop there as the post we started out with showed unvaccinated kids can be a risk to those around them your bad health decisions don't just affect you they affect your family and mine ironically a lot of parents who buy into alternative medicine because they're trying to avoid bogus treatments sold through targeted propaganda literally just believe what they do because they've been taken advantage of by snake oil salesmen the same people who say they're skeptical of conventional medicine and think Big Pharma is just trying to sell them vaccines to make money think that David avocado Wolfe is a reliable source of information and use his bogus supplements they're being sold the idea that they're being taken advantage of for money by the people who are actually taking advantage of them the core issue here is not simple ignorant it goes far beyond that what we're seeing is the result of targeted malicious misinformation yes we need to fight against charlatans taking advantage of these people we do need to counter bad information with good information and we do need to raise our standards for public education even more than that we need to promote critical thinking skills which inoculate us against the gullibility that charlatans feed upon unfortunately I think that a certain degree of gullibility comes naturally to most people so this is a bit of an uphill battle here's what I propose misinformation spreads easily through social media but I don't see any reason why good information can't spread through the same channels I mean that's why my channel exists let's be polite but consistent in sharing that information and exemplify good critical thinking skills among our friends and family the vaccine issue or any issue of Public Health for that matter is not just a legal issue or a scientific issue it's a cultural one so all of you guys get out there find some ridiculous claims and respectfully challenge them the best you can hopefully you'll find at least a few things to laugh at along the way thanks for watching drue of genetically modified skeptic preys beyond the atom my top patron and personal Lord and Savior for making this video possible go ahead and

0,"- You'll soon be at peace. Man: I'm dying? No, your wife is. (laughing) That is messed up, man! (electronic music) Memes are a great way to waste time, and a little procrastination
 never hurt anybody. Bee-whoop! Doctor: what do you see? Her: A virgin in his forties. (laughing) Okay, get out. And the girl's so smiley in the picture. It makes it even better. A classic Franklin story. Franklin fakes an injury
 to get Percocet. (laughing) I hope Franklin isn't doing that because then he's gonna be
 part of the opioid epidemic. Franklin, shape up. When you're talking about
 class with your friends and your non-med school friend
 is sitting there like... You know, that's funny,
 whenever I try and talk to my friends about med
 school and it gets deep, they just tell me right
 away, they're like, ""Mike, nobody wants to hear this."" Mom: He's about to go viral any day now. You started an Instagram for him? I didn't vaccinate him. (laughing) I got the black lung, Pop. Your throat is sore and swollen? These giant unswallowable horse pills should clear that right up. I have to constantly remind myself that a five-year-old or a seven-year-old cannot swallow these mega horse pills. But I'm gonna give you
 a strategy right now on how to swallow large pills. You ready? You take the pill. You put it on your tongue. Take a water bottle, preferably one that's three
 quarters of the way full. Tilt it up and then suck in so that the water bottle crumples
 a little bit, and swallow. You won't even feel the pill going down. Polio, hepatitis, tetanus breaking in, and then you have like a
 little essential oil Cheeto or Dorito or whatever
 that is holding the door. Essential oils. What are you doing? Polio has a rod in your Cheeto! Food falls, bacteria after five seconds: it's free real estate. Bacteria don't hang out and go
 wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Chills, bros, gotta give it a few seconds. No, they just hop right on. Doctor: what brings you here today? Me: my car, ha ha. Doctor, writing in chart:
 ""not sexually active"" (laughs) When you're ready to
 memorize the entire semester in 12 hours. (laughs) Yo, this was me, it's Thursday. My test is on Monday,
 and I'm just sit down. I have Broxy sitting below me and she's just looking up at me, waiting for me to take her out 'cause she just loves
 to play all the time, and I'm like, ""No. I have
 to watch these lectures."" And I would go, in one day, watch two weeks of lectures,
 just bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. Then Friday, again,
 watch all the lectures. Bam, bam, bam. Then Saturday and Sunday,
 practice questions, practice questions, practice questions. And then come in Monday;
 do well on the test. Doctors told this man that
 he had only one year to live. He worked hard and proved them wrong. He died in two months. (laughing) That's messed up. T-Pain full name; Tylenol Painrelief. If that's really his
 name, that's really funny. I know it's not his name. Taking a test: 12, C, 13, C, 14, C, 15, C. Me: Well, one of these gotta be wrong. Oh my God, when I saw a few
 in a row that were C or B, I would be having a panic attack and I would go back to
 try and change one of them and I wish I didn't do that. Your first gut instinct
 is usually the right one. I have bad news, and worse news. The bad news is you have 24 hours to live, And the worst news? I meant to tell you yesterday. (laughs) 2009, 2019 ten year challenge. (laughs) Oh, that's so good. It has all these carbs in 2009, and then insulin in 2019
 because you became a diabetic in ten years from maxing out on the carbs. Refined carbs are evil, people. All right, I'm gonna get off my high horse because I love cookies
 and cream milkshakes. Master P out here looking
 like a mitochondria. He kind of does look like a mitochondria. Doctor: Why did you take
 your antibiotic at 6am, when I told you 9am? By the way, that happens. I wanted to surprise the bacteria. I think the picture
 makes this meme better, because the guy's just like You don't surprise bacteria. They surprise you. Me: I'm so scared for this exam. Also me: (laughs) There's something powerful when you're nervous about an exam, and you act naughty and not
 study and watch Netflix instead it feels good for some reason, I don't even know where
 that goodness comes from. When you gotta straight
 jacket the Med student so he don't touch your sterile field. (laughs) I'm not gonna lie, when I was
 going into my first surgeries, I did touch the sterile field, or at least come close to
 touching the sterile field and I got yelled at. I probably could have benefited from one of these straight jackets myself. That one molecule of
 serotonin trying to keep me going throughout the day. (laughs) I like this one. Serotonin is what you
 get inside of the brain that helps elevate your
 mood along with dopamine. If you connect the measles, it spells out, ""My parents are idiots."" (laughs) Anti-vax people, what are you doing? Come on Facebook, just forty more likes and I can save that
 little girl's... (laughs) People always make fun of me like, ""Do you think you took that selfie while the patient was dying?"" No I didn't take the selfie
 while someone was dying. It takes ten seconds to take a selfie or for someone to take a picture of you. How I felt when I was in high school. Albert Einstein. How I feel being in Med school, (laughs) Planet of the Apes. It's easier to do well in a small town, in a small school because there's less people to compete against. Then you go to a med school, or you go to a competitive
 university like Harvard and all of a sudden you're
 surrounded by people who are all brilliant, and who were all killing it in high school,
 that can be really stressful. And its important to not consistently look at what others are doing
 and how they're performing, and judge yourself based on that. She's suffering from Appendicitis. (laughs) That's really funny. I wonder who that model is. Family medicine doctors
 describing their salary. It's ain't much, but it's honest work. Pretty much all of
 primary care belongs here, pediatrics, psychiatry, family medicine. Lady: am I okay? Paramedic: it's just
 a scratch on your leg. Lady: let me see. The leg is in the other ambulance. (laughs) Oh! Want the good news or bad news first? Good news please doctor. Well they're naming a
 disease after you. (laughs) I wonder what the bad news is. Dogs can't operate MRI machines. But cats can. Meow! Girl: Why don't we get vaccines? Dad: Honey why would we trust doctors when we can trust the internet? Boy: I miss my brother. Girl: My blood hurts. (laughs) Anti-vaxers are gonna destroy
 my channel after this. Me when my classmates are
 talking about their answers after the exam. I was the worst when it came to this. No joke, after the test, I would run up to my classmates
 who were in my BSDO program and I'd be like, ""What did you get for the
 one that was about this? What did you get for the
 one that was about this? What did you put for the--"" And everyone was like,
 ""Mike you're so annoying, we just want to relax, leave us alone."" Don't worry buddy, I've
 got some essential oils doing their work. Hells ya bruh, that
 lavender oil is kickin' in. That's (squeaking noise) fire. I swear to god the essential oil community and the naturopaths are coming to get me. Doctor: The disease is gone. Her: So my son is gonna be okay? I just told you he's gone. (laughs) Oh my god these things just get
 worse and meaner and meaner. Why can't we just create
 funny memes that are just, ya know, happy and uplifting? How does the-- the most evil thing ever. Doctor: These tests show great health. Nice. They're not yours, you're barely alive. The cockiest hospital I have ever seen. Ooh, I like this hospital. You know this is a good
 time to bring this up. You know this staff, that's
 supposed to represent medicine and doctors? That's the symbol of gamblers, robbers, and thieves or something. It has nothing to do with medicine. We've misinterpreted the use. The correct is one staff with
 the snake going around it. Using the opthalmoscope for
 the first time feels like. (laughs) Oh my god, ophthalmoscope
 is that thing that we use to do a fundoscopic exam. What you're supposed to learn, and if you didn't know this, is if you're looking at
 the patient's left eye, as a doctor you should be
 using your right eye to look, So that you're not making
 out or touching eyes. And then when you're
 checking their right eye, you should be using your left eye. And I've seen doctors mess that up, where they're looking at their left eye, and the doctor's using their left eye, and they're almost kissing the patient. Oh, that's the awkward. Doctor: You remind me of my cell phone. Woman: How? Because you're about to die. (laughs) Oh my god. Can't even charge her.

0,I don't know Halloween is just like a weird holiday to be dressing up as anybody else's cold you say the same thing about any costume are you gonna tell a six-year-old girl she can't dress up like a pirate because she doesn't know the history of pirates like that's we're all technically white you're from England if you're from Australia if you're from wherever South Africa you know we all have these crazy places we come from and these people were around and we get those ideas from those people but that doesn't mean us as a whole have no culture but as a white person it's not really a culture you can have culture like I'm hella Irish obviously and that's a culture but that just being white is not a it's it's not a culture I can't relate to you just because you're white I think you could say that for any ethnicity though if we were all black could I relate to you guys if just because of the color of our skin yes because they go through some very similar experiences like they'll get discriminated against and you're not getting discriminated against because of your skin color they can both relate to that but I also feel like with culture we branch out we try different things we want to do different things so maybe we've lost a little bit of our culture maybe we're creating a new culture we can explain it okay reverse racism is like someone being racist against you because you were white like do you believe that someone can be racist against a white person yes I grew up where it was completely like Hispanic culture I was constantly made fun of because I was white Oh white people can't dance white people look stupid whatever they shouldn't say white people can't dance but I think they can I just putting that out there but I like being honest though like they would say those mean things to me and more hurtful things than that it's like a hard pill to swallow because if I turned around said black people can't dance I'd get hell for that but then if someone says the same words to me it's somehow okay because you have to look at the difference of it though and I relate to you I grew up with all Latino or black friends I had very few white friends and you know I got made fun of for being like the white girl I was green God and I didn't take offense to it because the huge part about racism is that there's hate and oppression behind it and as a white person in America I do not feel oppressed and I definitely think that we should take the log out of our own eyes before worrying about the sawdust and other people's like I totally agree with that but there is sawdust so that's kind of what I'm saying for me I feel like anything we do can come out racist to any other type race where the same time if they say something mean or racist to us that we feel is racist it's brushed off I might think of the word racism I think more towards oppression so that's why I'm in the disagree like I'll deal if someone just being mean to me but what I think it's important to focus on race in order to bring us together there is a race issue in America and if we just avoid it all together and pretend like it's not happening nothing's going to change in my opinion I kind of was thinking about the question differently because if all I'm thinking about when I meet someone is oh I'm Way and she's not white and I'm Way and she's not white like that for me that's like what focusing on races yeah we're never gonna be happy unless we just like all work together just like treat each other like each other you know like there is no race yeah and that sounds great but it's like we're not there we're not there I feel like people who have that perspective might also say like oh I don't see color try not you know try to have that attitude I don't think that helps anybody I think we need to like to respect each other's backgrounds and like that is only gonna happen if we do see color we do like appreciate everybody's differences yeah I think cultural appropriation is very well you see all the time like Coachella you know we're in LA and you see people in the Native American headdresses without knowing how important that is to native people yeah exactly I think there's a difference between respecting the culture and completely disrespecting the culture but then also if you want to dress up and Halloween like a Geisha because you like the costume you think it's a beautiful costume that I wouldn't say is I wouldn't do that I think if you're gonna go and dress up as a geisha without knowing the importance of it and just being like well this is cute like I'm gonna put this on and also even if you did know the importance and you're like I don't know Halloween is just like a weird holiday to be dressing up as anybody else's cold you can say the same thing about any costume are you gonna tell a six-year-old girl that she can't dress up like a pirate because she doesn't know the history of pirates like that's very different so it's just like that's very different those are those are children I think because I think wearing that thing at Coachella like I feel like I would see that is that person mocking someone well even if they don't intentionally mean it it's still offensive the only reason I'm at somewhat disagree is because a lot of my favorite rappers use it frequently if I'm listening to my favorite childish gambino song which it drops it like a hundred times it's like I'm not sitting there thinking all these horrible things about black people and I'm like it's just in the song and when I'm singing it comes out there's like two different forms of the word there ends with an ER and with an A and like with my friends they're like oh you can say it with it's a like that won't hurt my feelings but also like even when I'm in the car by myself like I still feel like it's not my place maybe I'll like whisper it like with an A at the end you know like if I'm by myself but like I know the respect for other people I just think it's more appropriate not to say it at all do you guys think rappers should stop putting it in their songs I feel like everything it's wrong though I don't think it's wrong because the history of the n-word come you know slave owners would call black people as the n-word with the hard are at the end if black people want to take that word and claim it as their own and claim that that painful history and like be like f you like I'm gonna claim this word I think they should be allowed to do that I don't think as a white person I have that right to take a word that was derogatory towards them they should 100% have the right to do that do you think it's okay for a white person to sing the song see that's where more like all on the fence it's like I feel like it's just it's a word used as like my friend basically and like just like she said if they want to take that back from it's horrible origins then I'm totally fine with that but as a white person you can't say that word without feeling a certain way if you if they didn't put it in their songs you wouldn't say it right no so are they causing people just say that word more often because she wouldn't say it it's not white people's place to tell them what they can and cannot use so three-two-one it's so sad to say because I never say it out loud but it's the truth is like getting pulled over by the police I always feel like I have a little bit of a one-up because I'm white because I'm a woman and I feel so bad that that's the truth but this is a real thing and it's unfortunate for me as an individual I feel like I'm not privileged sure like white people background came from like being higher up on the scale but I've gone through really hard things before you know I don't feel like I'm superior for other people so as an individual I don't feel like I'm privileged I think privileged I guess I don't really think that I'm above other people I just think that naturally I'm treated different yeah it's like perception it's just perception it's yeah I think that's a huge misconception I have privilege that I didn't ask for it it's just society sees me as like the standard for whatever reason and because of that I get treated differently and why privilege you know like you said it's not about what you've gone through or what you experienced it's a hundred percent how the world sees me I don't I almost went there too it's like actually guiltily like I am like happy that I'm not oppressed but I'm not proud of like things people have done in the past when I when I think of being proud of something I think of something I worked for or that uh yeah I had to get I had to do nothing to be white absolutely nothing and nothing was taken from me because I was white it's like saying I'm a proud white person is a completely different saying than saying I'm a proud black person because when you hear I'm a proud black person I think empowerment I think strength I think courage I think you know all these amazing things that the black community has done and accomplished throughout the years but then when you say I am a strong or I'm a proud white person already there's so much like hate involved in that thing about that is like like how you said someone who says I'm proud to be black that's empowerment why aren't I allowed to be proud to be white what makes it proud of just your skin color because yes that is wrong so usually I can't be proud to be white because I don't have a culture no I you that's not what I'm saying they said when white people say they're proud to be white a lot of times at least in my opinion they're just they're talking about their skin color that they're not a different race I think that's wrong yeah but as like we were talking about as a proud black person they've been oppressed that a lot of their culture was stolen from them and a lot of reasons that I don't like proud to be white is because it hasn't the the Nazis used it the the KKK used it I don't want to be associated with any of those things so I'm just gonna completely stay away from that sure I'm not proud of like what my culture is done but at the same time like I would not want to be anything else if I had to choose another race I don't know what I would be I'm okay with where I am even though I'm getting backlash about being white hey guys this is John and I'm Erin thank you

 Seal, 'cause I'll sing Seal. - Let's do this. Guys, it's your boy ZDoggMD. Check it out, before we go any further, if you wanna spread light and reason, like the Z-pack does, 'cause
 this story is about how a member of the Z-pack brought to light both a HIPPA violation
 and anti-vaccine beliefs in a nurse who takes care
 of children for a living and that lead to corrective
 action on the part of the institution, Texas Children's. If you think that what

 and you can be a part of helping to support this movement, and you get early lives, special access to different content and stuff like that, and private conversations where we can set the agenda for the main show. All right, that
 housekeeping out of the way, this story is insane and
 there's a lot I wanna unpack. Okay, Texas Children's Hospital. There is a nurse there,
 I'm not gonna say her name, because honestly the
 press has already done it and I have no need, my goal is not to attack or humiliate or
 further damage an individual. My goal is to report
 to you what's happening and to talk about the ethical
 issues that we have around caregivers who hold beliefs
 that are antithetical to the evidence, antithetical to science, and could potentially represent
 public health threats. This is the story. This nurse is part of a
 anti-vaccine group online called Proud Parents of
 Unvaccinated Children in Texas. And this group obviously,
 I'm not a member of it, but we have spies in the group. And they obviously are
 against vaccinating children for all the reasons that they always site, which we have debunked
 again, and again, and again. So we're not gonna get into that. It turns out that one
 of the nurses works at Texas Children, takes care of children and she posted the following. And the reason we know what she posted is, one of the spies in the group, who has been working for
 a long time, tirelessly, to expose anti-vaccine sentiment within the medical profession
 and bring it to light so people can know what
 other medical professions are saying and spreading, especially if it's antithetical
 to the standard of care. This person wrote, ""So quite
 a few people know I'm a nurse. ""Some even know where I
 work and for the first time ""in my career I saw measles this week."" Well, it turns out we
 already know where that is, because we know there's
 a measles case in Texas and it's at this institution, right? ""Actually, most of my coworkers
 and ER docs saw measles "" for the first time as well."" You know why? Because we have eradicated it almost because we vaccinate. That's why. Surprise. ""And honestly, it was rough."" Ya think? Measles requiring
 hospitalization is rough? Ya think? This kid is in the ICU,
 you think it was rough? ""The kid was super sick. ""Sick enough to be admitted to the ICU ""and he looked miserable. ""You couldn't touch him without
 him crying, moaning in pain. ""It was terrible. ""I think it's easy for us non-vaxxers to "" A nurse just said ""us non-vaxxers"". Nurses are the most trusted profession according to surveys. More trusted than physicians. I'm just gonna leave
 that there for a second. They are more trusted than physicians. ""It's easy for us non-vaxxers
 to make assumptions ""but most of us have never and will never ""see one of these diseases. ""By no means have I changed my vax stance, ""and I never will, but I
 wanted to share my experience ""and how much worse it
 was than I expected."" What did you expect? What your anti-vaccine
 cohort is telling you? Which is measles is a natural
 function of growing up and is a self-limiting
 illness that doesn't cause any problems but some
 little pimples on your face that get better, and getting
 it naturally is a great idea, and vaccines have wrecked
 children's health? That's what you believe, huh? Hmm. ""Well, maybe this was an extreme case. ""Maybe most fair better, but
 this poor kid was bad off ""and as a parent, I could
 see vaccinating out of fear. ""Seeing it made me a little more humble, ""and maybe a little more understanding. ""I'll continue along with
 my little non-vax journey ""with no regrets, but I'll
 definitely have more compassion ""to those who vehemently vaccinate."" You mean the vast majority of educated and uneducated people in this country. You are the outliers by
 denying decades of research and one of the greatest
 public health triumphs. Now this bit was screen captured along with the first
 comment response to it. Listen to this. I'm not gonna say this
 person's name because it will humiliate her, because she
 deserves to be humiliated, but I'm not gonna say it. ""Um, sunlight can make measles painful. ""He may have been
 exposed to too much sun."" (snort) That is the first comment
 to this comment about a kid in the ICU at Texas Children's who is struggling with measles and is sick enough that this nurse who is anti-vaccine, felt
 compelled to post about it. This is the level of stupidity,
 misunderstanding, ignorance and just, and this is why
 we have resurgent measles. 'Cause we're not immunizing everybody. We're losing our herd immunity and this kid who traveled
 abroad, now comes back, He was too young to be
 vaccinated, all right? And now he's sick and here
 in this country we have people who choose not to vaccinate and then they are exposing
 kids who are too young or they have immune disease
 that they cannot be vaccinated to this disease that is
 potentially life-threatening as is shown by this person, in the ICU. And this is the comment. ""Sunlight can make measles painful. ""He may have been
 exposed to too much sun."" And am I using a mocking tone? Yes because these people
 deserve to be mocked. We as educated, even
 if we're not educated, as members of a civil society should shame and have no tolerance for
 people who are threats to public health through pure ignorance, fear, and stupidity. And when that person is a nurse, is a member of the tribe of health care, they need to be pointed out. And so this is what happened. That was screen captured, along with the next comment she left, which is this. ""Sorry guys,"" This nurse left this comment. ""I worked way too hard and
 owe too much in student loans ""to jeopardize my license, so I deleted ""a lot of my responses. ""I love my job, I love
 being in healthcare. ""I really want to keep info to a minimum ""and if when this case
 makes news, I'll elaborate. ""Love you all. ""Keep strong in your beliefs,"" You pieces of crap, ""We are all on this journey for a reason ""and we are not wrong in
 our beliefs/convictions. ""I'll share more as I feel comfortable."" Okay, so it was clear that she realized her job could be threatened
 due to what ended up happening, which is it being classified
 as a HIPPA Privacy Violation to talk about a patient using
 any patient identifiers, PHI. Patient, the Patient Health Information and this is what she did. So the other comment that she left next, listen to this. She's responding to the
 same woman who left the ""Sunlight can cause measles"" comment and this is what she said. ""Um, well, so and so, still
 waiting on lab results. Those take days. He had traveled
 internationally to a region where wild measles is
 very common, so my guess would be it was wild measles."" By the way, another HIPPA violation. And then this is what we circled. ""I'm not kidding that I thought
 about swabbing his mouth and bringing it home to my 13 year old."" Now this comment was not reported in the subsequent press storm that happened. She actually joked about taking
 a swab from this sick child and bringing it home
 and naturally infecting her probably unvaccinated
 13 year old child. Do you understand this is
 a nurse at a children's, was a nurse at a children's hospital? She is talking about spreading
 a highly communicable disease in the community
 because of her belief that natural immunity
 is better than vaccines. Just let that set in for a second. Well here's what ended up happening. One of the Z-packers, long time z-packer, found this message,
 shared the screen shots with Texas Children's
 Hospital, her employer, who immediately wrote back,
 ""Thank you for your message. ""We are aware of this
 situation and have started a ""thorough investigation of this employee. ""We take these matters very
 seriously and view this, ""and this employees' view
 does not represent that ""of the organization."" Suddenly the press got ahold of this. It went viral. The next day this nurse is fired. So here's the question. Was she fired for anti-vaccine beliefs? Should that be a possibility? Or was she fired for a HIPPA violation? Sounds to me like she
 was fired for violating the social media policy
 and the HIPPA policies of that hospital. As a care member of the
 care team for this patient she is a covered entity under HIPPA. Meaning she's bound by the rules of HIPPA, which means she cannot share,
 in unencrypted channels, patient health information, PHI. Private Health Information. In this case, and that, by the way, if you're thinking about
 sharing patient stories, think again because the
 definition of that is much broader than you think. Sex, age, condition,
 hospitalization status, any of those things potentially could be considered PHI, depending. And in this case, the fact, People are like, Well is
 wasn't a HIPPA violation, it could've been anybody. No, it couldn't. There were only that
 case of measles, right? So, you're already narrowing it down. Then she says oh, he got it from travel. You've already given history, so this is this is clearly a terrible
 idea to share this information. Forget about the vaccine stuff. Let's take some comments. Tom, what've we got? - Jessica says, ""As an
 RN, unfortunately, I know ""a lot of anti-vax RNs."" - Yeah, and I'm gonna tell you this, There are anti-vaccine doctors. They are insane. They have no credibility. You know, people like Mercola. People like Tenpenny, who doesn't even have a license anymore, isn't
 board certified in internal, in emergency medicine anymore. We know these characters,
 and there are some that are opportunists that will
 write exemptions for money, and things like that,
 so we know those guys. The truth is, I don't think the public trusts those guys that much. Nurses, however, have a deep trust because there isn't the
 sense that they're in this for a bunch of money. There isn't the sense that they make money from prescriptions and care
 and treatment and vaccines, so people really lean on them. When they violate that
 trust, and there are a butt-ton of anti-vax nurses. There are a butt-ton of anti-vax people throughout the healthcare spectrum, very few doctors, but the
 doctors that are there are, you can just tell they're just coo coo. With nurses it's trickier
 because they're otherwise great nurses. They just happen to hold this fixed belief that is incorrect in most cases. Now, with the one in
 this particular group, there is a particular violation of trust. The idea that she is
 violating private information, talking about a patient who's afflicted, you can tell by her description that she's actually quite affected by how sick this patient is
 and probably quite surprised because guess what? We don't see these diseases because of the success of vaccines. That's why it's the first time
 the ER docs are seeing it. 'cause we pretty much eradicated measles until the anti-vaccine movement took vaccines out of some
 percentage of the population and now we're losing the herd immunity and it's coming back, okay? So, she's violating the trust. She takes care of children, which means she's advising parents not to vaccinate. And here she is, coming to this group after seeing this sick patient and still cheerleading and then to add insult to injury, to add pestilence to plague, she is saying that she's gonna, thinking of swabbing this kid's cheek and spreading it to her kid
 like it's a chicken pox party, which is also a really stupid idea, because children can die of chicken pox. I have seen it. Until you've seen it, you can't talk. So shut up. Gah, I get so furious when trusted members of the healthcare
 profession do this. Now people are gonna say isn't
 it her first amendment right? No, it is not your first amendment right to break the law and violate HIPPA. Is it your right to have
 anti-vaccine beliefs? Sure, and it's my right to think that you're a danger to others
 and a public health threat and should be fired from your job. And that's what happened here. Not 'cause of the anti-vax stuff, but 'cause of the HIPPA stuff. But I think you should be fired for for actually ever holding these beliefs. Because, you know what? This is a private employer. All right, I'm not gonna
 hire Tom Hinuber if I think he's a racist psychopath, right? Or maybe I'll give him
 a raise, I don't know. But it's my prerogative to do that. And I think in health
 care, holding these beliefs is dangerous, damaging, and antithetical to everything we train and to the hypocratic
 oath, and all of that. Other comments. - People have this
 erroneous notion today that the first amendment means I can just say whatever I want with no consequences. No, you get to say whatever you want. It doesn't mean there are no consequences, especially in private matters
 like you just pointed out. I mean, and the great thing
 about the first amendment, is it lets us know that there
 are these idiots out there. Because if you're a racist, if you're an anti-vaxxer,
 if you're whatever, you say it, and then we get to be like Oh, thank god, this
 person had really shitty thoughts in their head and they let the rest of us know, and now we're all a little safer because we can get them out of our community. - I will fight to the death to
 protect the first amendment. Partially for those reasons, 'cause then you know where people stand. - And there's also this
 thing about like, okay, we're publicly shaming this woman. Although we're not using her name, right? The reason we're doing so is
 actually, I think, righteous. Because people insulate
 themselves in these bubbles. This woman watched a
 child die of the measles and she goes and runs back to her little anti-vax message boards and goes ""Don't worry, I'm still
 part of the tribe, heh heh."" Like, we need to pop
 that bubble in a big way because people are not
 doing it for themselves. - And I wanna clarify
 the child didn't die, but the child is sick as a dog in the ICU and for her to go back, and I'm on my little anti-vaccine journey, Okay, everything Tom said is correct. She has the right to say those things. She doesn't not have the right
 to avoid the consequences that come from what you say. No Facebook group is
 truly secret or private. Anything you say online can
 and will be used against you in the court of public
 opinion if it comes out. I lay myself out every single day and I'm willing to take the
 consequences of what I say. I've said some things that I mildly regret and then I talk about why I regret them. In this case, she is
 feeling the consequences and one of the consequences that we have been really bad at doing, and I wanna differentiate between nurse on nurse lateral
 violence and bullying and public shaming of somebody
 who is a danger to others. In this case, this person
 has put their beliefs there. We are now taking those and going, this is why these are dumb, dangerous, and this person should lose their job. First amendment on both sides. Now, if you think that
 it's just the Z-pack that does this to others, if you think that our movement is just
 here to shame and humiliate and hurt people, you're absolutely wrong. It's to protect children
 and those who cannot protect themselves. And if you think that
 the anti-vaccine movement doesn't do this, you're wrong. There was a Z-packer, recently,
 in the last year or two who reached out to me because she had posted a comment just as a joke saying, ""you know what, I think if, ""if a patient, if a mother
 doesn't want their child to get ""a vaccination, I feel like
 whoops, I made a medical error, ""I would just vaccinate them anyways."" It was a joke, and probably
 not in good taste, right? But the anti-vaxxers took her screen shot, sent it to the board of nursing in Texas, this was in Texas as well,
 and had her harassed. People were doxxing her, pulling
 up information about her. Sending, you know, reviews
 and horrible threats to her and this is what the
 anti-vaccine people have been doing forever. I talked to Paul Offit,
 I read an early copy of his recent book called Bad Advice. He has been, he's a big vaccine proponent, He has been physically threatened. He has been verbally attacked in person. People will stalk him. This is a tactic, a long standing tactic, of the anti-vaccine movement. Now, when our movement,
 which really stands for truth, science, reason, right? Discourse. When our movement takes their playbook and just copies and pastes
 and sends it to the employer, suddenly all kinds of
 legal action's threatened and all kinds of oh my gosh and you can bet that this is
 gonna be a massive poop storm. Because they're getting a
 taste of their own medicine. If you're gonna have these beliefs and you're gonna take care of patients in a Children's Hospital,
 you better be prepared to stand up and take the consequences. What do you think Tom Hineburg? Comments? - Mark, Mark, Mark-kwa-rette? Sorry if I butchered your name. Says, ""I've been an RN for 25 years. ""Since when did sharing personal opinions ""with patients and families become okay?"" - This is a great question actually. I want to talk about
 this just very slightly. A lot of patients will ask us, what would you do for your
 loved one in this case? And I actually think
 that is a very important question to answer. So a lot of times, I will
 say look, the data says this, preponderance of doctors would say this, if this were my mom, knowing
 what her wishes are and that, I would do this. So, they actually rely on us to give us, to give a little bit of a
 human connection on that. So sharing our thoughts is not necessarily verboten, it's not actually forbidden. It's when it's an, this is a true opinion because there's no science
 to back up what she's saying. And in this case what you're doing is you're undermining the care team, so the rest of the team is saying, listen, you gotta vaccinate. Here's a child with measles who was too young to be
 vaccinated apparently, before they went on this trip. And got it in a different country, came back, now is suffering with this terrible disease in an ICU. By the way, and all our thoughts
 are going out to this child and their family who are suffering. And this press is not making it better. We do wanna be able in a
 position to give our personal experience and thoughts. This is why this is
 such a direct violation. Because it has already been established. This is not a debate anymore. This is like saying oh they
 didn't land on the moon. Except it causes death
 and harm and disability when we don't vaccinate. If you don't believe
 people landed on the moon, you're just an idiot. If you believe the Earth is
 flat, you're just a moron. You're not hurting
 other people, except for to hurt their brains with your stupidity. But with vaccines, if you're a nurse and you're going on the board and being like, ""I would swab his cheek ""and then give it to my
 child for natural immunity."" You are not only dumb, you're dangerous. And that's what differentiates this. This is where it's like
 running into a theater and yelling fire and causing a panic and causing people to
 be stampeded to death or trampled to death. - I think that's a good place to wrap up. - Tommy T-Bone, so let me -- - That's a good place to wrap up. - Let me end by saying this. I am very proud that members of the Z-pack are willing to take personal risk to bring to light when this
 kind of thing is happening. We have been attacked, we're used to it. We in the sort of pro-science community are used to being shit on and attacked. I'll tell you right now, you're gonna see a ton of anti-vax idiots commenting immediately on this
 video, and they're gonna be like, ""Oh my god,
 look at Z-dogg's face. ""He's got dark circles and
 some weird pimples, 'cause he ""went to the dermatologist and had some ""disease removed because
 he's vaccine injured."" That's the kind of stupidity,
 we're willing to take those ad hominems, that's fine. It's just dumb. What is different is
 we're willing to stand up and actually do the right thing for our patients, our
 children, our communities, and this was a great case of that. If you think this is something you wanna be a deeper part of. If you wanna have sort of
 more personal conversations around this stuff, and the topics. If you wanna support our show
 and support all this stuff that we do and give us a bigger voice, and help go to bat for Z-packers, too, who are under attack, feel free to click that become a supporter
 link and you can become part of this sort of
 sub-tribe group that we have. Obviously, if you don't wanna do that or you don't have the
 resources to do that, hit share instead, spread the word, keep learning and teaching others, and doing what you do. Z-pack, we love you and we out. - Yo, Z has just straight

-1,"hey YouTube units up another XYZ welcome back to another club buying or it's your boy I think already said that another XYZ and you already read the title this video where I on are / anti facts and now for anybody who I know who may be an anti back sir you're wrong you're wrong everybody dies from preventable diseases that essentially have been gone for so aren't vaccine anymore and a weird they're starting to show back up again I being said let's just jump right into this thing so the first one I have here do your blank health link calling me once a week with an automated message telling me of this measle outbreak and a vaccinate is not going to work these outbreaks happen every year how else would Marisa ba and having to say vaccines are safe four separate times is far from reassuring huh trying to peer pressure you huh I know always after the money speaking of facts I didn't have the pox backs we had a pox party one of the kids in school got them and all the moms made us play with him so that we'd get them and get it over with chicken pox parties ha ha that's awesome chicken pox I remember being so fun we got to stay home and watch movies all day pox parties were normal as a kid that makes me old which means you're old too lol yes there wasn't a silly vaccine for chickenpox back then grandma Texas has been doing the same to us they call us at once a month and I'm thing is she's talking about pox parties I feel like I remember them I grew up in a city that was pretty much a geriatric community so that doesn't sound too far off from it but if you can avoid chicken pox chicken pox lives in your body and then later on life becomes shingles which is like ah ha nightmare so if you can just avoid it altogether I mean probably the better thing and honestly I don't number a chickenpox vaccine but I remember having chickenpox and it was not a fun time I was itching I was I'd have the chamomile lotion spread all time so anybody who wants to submit their children to this is kind of a SATA outlawed and this next one's pretty hilarious cuz your boy Travis loves him some sanic when a doctor tells an anti-tax mom their kids gonna die whoa that's interesting but I sure don't care it's so true cuz people who are in anti back to just don't want to listen the facts and the science people tell me look at the ingredients lists all the time but honestly I would it's just a lot of the ingredients list of people looking at her like old ingredients lists or stuff where it's just like there may be trace elements of something in there but it's not enough to cause harm to people like they've been scientifically tested for decades and decades I think we're in a good spot of those so onto the next one proud mom moment my daughter asked me yesterday if she will get a shot before middle school next years I was so proud to let her know that she will never be in jail she will never been injected with anything God English is terrible for these people I told her she may need blood drawn a few times but I would be there she is never to say okay without me there and I won't agree to it she's been told if anyone tries to force her she's just scream run curse and say that she is an exemption call nine-one-one if she can go if she can get to a phone or call me she gave me a hug because she knows I'm protecting her and her brother from harm hashtag MTHFR sucks hashtag vaccines cause harm hashtag protect the kids hashtag we can't detox toxins hashtag medical exemption hashtag medical freedom hashtag no means no and I mean hey I would this one you know I'm all for freedom of choice but not all so if you're going through school where they require vaccines they do that for a germs and viruses etc etc it's not only protecting the people who the children at the school but also the people who work with your children let's look let's take for example immunodeficient people right let's say later on in life one of the people at that school gain some sort of immunodeficiency problem and then all mumps rubella etc and pass it on this immunodeficient person and they die that's where for me it just doesn't make any sense I get the religious freedom and not religious but the I get the medical freedom thing and being able to do what you want to do but that being said if that's the case I mean homeschool your children if you really want to make that decision but at the end of the day you're putting everybody's health at risk even your own kids even though you're trying to do something good it just it's just not right it's not right man here's another one thank you so much for this video I work as an x-ray tech they make me get this BS shot every year I should be able to refuse this shot right up on flu shot or decree action and go to a new doctor a nurse practitioner for a regular checkup tell them you how to reaction last year to a red rash that developed around your body and face after you got the flu shot get an excuse or find a way to forge it that's what I do I work at a hospital and failure Forge it if you just tell this person and commit a crime who defines a crime isn't it a crime to force people to get a shot of a week in their immune system possibly for life and cause a host of problems I knowingly and willfully rebel against force vaccinations and then fake such form forged my flu and she spelled flu wrong vaccine yearly also my MMR what is it MMR an also look at a cause and they want me to get a second round aside from the ignorant my ignorant childhood ones the structures sorry guys the structuring of these sentences a little while you can diffuse it now they've your rights and preferences it is not their call to make your health decisions employee confidentiality as well as HIPAA law fake it for - sticker it's not hard trust me isn't the crime being forced to be vaccinated in a free country or face a penalty like being fired vaccines are not subjective double-blind studies and the companies are not immune to prosecution winner great resource fulness never heard of a person going to jail or faking a vaccine a vaccine reaction to get it put into their mental or their medical history mint mental patients if you're working with people especially if you're doing what do you see an x-ray tech yet it the tax rate check isn't really all that hands-on but let's say if somebody who has a really really like I said before weekend immuno like we can immunodeficiency you know like you are putting other people at risk when you don't get vaccinated I'm sorry all if you believe that vaccinations are good for your vaccine some aren't good for you then you're in the wrong you're in the wrong in this one this next one is hilarious because it kind of shows the anti-vaxxer mindset where they kind of just sweep everything in without actually looking into what causes the things they're saying our results of vaccines essentially so here we go 1960 the largest commercial airliner the Boeing 707 holds a maximal of 216 people autism rate 1 in 2,500 1996 the largest commercial airliner at the Boeing 747 holds a maximum of six hundred and sixty people autism rate one in 300 2013 the largest commercial airliner the Airbus a380 holds a maximum 853 people autism are evil planes cause autism hashtag planes cause autism hashtag planes are gonna be the end of us hashtag cleans our bourse and vaccines put that in the chat drop an F in the chat for that drop enough in the chat for that this is another funny one dr. Mario doesn't have any good matchups me dr. Mario vs. anti-vaxxer go get them salty smash means in there yeah all right and here's another one with everybody's favorite yellow piles vaccinations why should your children well it's probably because minions are knows if they're getting vaccines nobody's talked about their vaccine records we didn't know if there's vaccinated we don't know we don't know these things and absolutely this has got on an teabags but I have no idea where they originally got it from feels like some Facebook just Facebook ass cancer now admittedly this next one I have not seen Burt box yet so based on everything I know about it I feel like this meme is pretty spicy but as you can see evidence everywhere anti-vaxxer in the middle you don't look at the evidence man you aren't looking at the evidence you of vaccines are bad for you this next one is absolutely wild because I'm pretty sure autism doesn't work this way I have a friend with a 16 year-old autistic daughter she became autistic right after a vaccine shot I know the first step is probably to detox the body any idea about this protocol because the way she set up is her friend as a 16 year-old autistic daughter she became left to stick right after a vaccine shut no is that the way it's phrased it makes me think that they got autism after like at age 16 after receiving a vaccine shot which I'm pretty sure that's not how that works I'm confident it's not I'm sure that's not how that works in this next one it's a little bit it's a little thrown in here just to let you guys get an idea of the absolutely terrible essentially terrible irony that happens with these antibac sings on the left here free Peyton literally no health care is affordable health care is a human right so we get mad at the gate this person doesn't believe that health care is a human right which I mean I think honestly we should have more affordable health care and I think everybody should have access to at least some sort of basic health care so that we aren't all on the that I can get behind about following up at LA Times whooping cough state urges more people to get vaccinated no vaccines are from the devil I don't think I've ever seen anything in the Bible that specifically says and I would consider myself Christian individual that vaccines are a creation by the devil I just don't think that it's accurate or true and the posts underneath it the Federalists and Federalist writer and pundit repaid and dies after sudden illness the 26 year old pundit was found unconscious and admitted to a hospital on Thursday where she was where she passed away the diagnostic one N one flu painten's colleagues at conservative site the federal and other others media's paid tribute to her maybe it's cuz she didn't get vaccinated and it's that I mean I hate to be that guy but I think it's probably cuz she doesn't what's the back spirit and then just throw in another spicy mean here classic spongebob auntie backs kid I'm turning five next year auntie back Salam no you ain't oh man whoa spicy and then I got a cap it off with one more funny meme and of course this one is topical considering that my love for the Friday the 13th game so auntie vex mom's Essential Oils measles this almost ties in with my last video of anti MLM if you guys haven't seen that go check it out I'll drop a card up top everywhere that we're like no don't vaccinate your children no you don't need to go on diets all you have to do cabbage juice oh my god what a wonderful idea you won't you don't cure cancer or regrow your Lambs at the end of the day science is science and the facts are out there people in the facts are we're living longer lives because of vaccines and medical advancements and I get that sometimes some of them don't work out quite the way we expect but vaccines have been around too long in the game and they are to the point now where they're so safe it's ridiculous and they're I think we're gonna find out that they're not causing autism no they're not they really are but that means said remember to slap that rumor to slap that like button give me a you drop what you knew the chat I also remembered hit that subscribe button I think I might have already said that but either way no glove no live all our peace you"
-1,hey everyone today we are gonna be talking about something I've wanted to talk about for quite a while but I've only ever kind of touched on before and that is a subject of anti-vaxxers and he faxes are people who do not believe in vaccinating their children they can believe this for a variety of reasons some people think that vaccines are bad because they cause autism some people think they're ineffective some people think they lead to things like heavy metal toxicity there's there's a whole bunch of reasons I could go into the kind of like science behind why vaccines work and but I think that's a topic I'm going to kind of wait for another day or I can do a longer more dedicated video about it it's a topic we really want to touch really soon on but here in how podcast so that's probably going to be a slightly better longer form that kind of medium to talk about that topic in today we're gonna be looking at some posts from Facebook groups by anti-vaxxers and kind of looking at their conversation because I want to get an idea of like what the real people who are on key boxes think it's very easy to get this idea in your head of anti-vaxxers has been like using soon crazy like New Age hippie type people but they're not it might surprise you the kind of people who are anti-vaxxers and the reasons behind why they're on T backs and so on and I mean none of that stops them being like objectively wrong about vaccines but I was thinking it would give us a look into kind of their perspective about things and we can kind of try and see things from their side and understand their motives and stuff a little bit because I don't think these people have bad intentions it's just the consequences of their actions are really really dangerous so I think it's something worth talking about as always with these posts I'm going to try my best to sense out everyone's name and pictures and make sure there's no identifiable information because while I feel okay sharing these things because they are on you know a public forum I don't necessarily want to like publicly shame the individuals behind it so I'm gonna be like covering them as much as I possibly can so the first post I want to look at is from a woman who says hi parents dealing with my teenage cousin who is soot whom is stupid that's weird who is suicidal and depressed I mean reading that depression could be a side effect of vaccines she was faxed sick since 6 years old she is now 14 looking for ways to do detox or anything natural I don't want to put her on medication so first up critical credits do a good job on not just dismissing this as like random teenage angst depression and anxiety and mental health problems are really really big dealing teenagers as well as in adults but often they kind of get swept under the rug a little bit more so good job in recognizing this as a real problem and good job on noting that it actually needs you know a proactive approach toward towards fixing it you can't just tell someone like I'll get over it man up whatever you can't do that so good job there however you're completely wrong in thinking that depression has anything to do with vaccinations no there is no legitimate evidence to suggest a causal link between being vaccinated and having depression especially not you know being vaccinated years ago and having depression years in the future that there's no causal link there at all you're just kind of reaching now I'm looking for explanations where that probably isn't long sometimes people's brain chemistry just gets a bit out of whack sometimes there are reasons for that sometimes is not so much of an obvious reason but let's be honest there's no logical reason why my basically teaching something new to the immune system would cause the brain to project over or under produce certain neurotransmitters it just that they're not related there were lots and lots of kind of like typical replies lots of repeated stuff a lot of people recommended CBD oil that was something I saw a lot like pretty much the answer to every problem is CBD oil apparently and one thing which also came up a lot which I wasn't really familiar with was this idea of TRS oil or TRS detox so I decided to look into this a little bit more and find out what it was turns out you can buy a tiny tiny little bottle of TRS detox from Amazon for like $90 yeah that much and basically it's just an insanely overpriced little liquid that apparently is a kind of miracle cure they write that TRS is short for advanced toxin and contaminants removal system it's but hard to get my mouth around and it's a product manufactured in the USA by a company called Kosovo a workstream u2 move heavy metals and other toxins in the body there are only two ingredients in TRS man-made Nano zeolites and purified water zeolites basically being a type of mineral consisting of hydrated aluminosilicates sodium potassium calcium and barium berrak barium oh my god why can't I say these words today so basically just very simple they could used as occasion exchanges and molecular sips okay cool my the other one who finds it a bit weird that you know this is a group of people who are notö notorious for saying that they don't trust Big Pharma because they were only out to make money by shelling these man-made vaccines which aren't nuts and yet here they are shelling out a ton of money for man-made chemicals it's a bit bit hypocritical isn't it of course the difference between these two things is that vaccines have been developed over long periods of time by experts in the field they've been tested and they've been deemed safe they go through rigorous and kind of testing and regulations and safety checks before they give them to the public I definitely trust this over a pretty unregulated private company who also create essential oils and if you look at their website they're not very transparent with a lot of things but it seems there have been no longer to daniil studies done on the effects I've given things like TRS detox to anyone but in particular children so we don't really know how safe it is at least I couldn't find any information about that if I'm wrong please let me know and this is Mary laughs the company admits that they only work to quality standards that they created themselves so there's no like outside regulation there's no one kind of watching over them and checking what they're doing is okay which is a little dodgy to me and they do admit that they use a third-party lab to test the quality of their products however this lab is an essential oils research lab so again I don't really trust it but okay and this essential oils research lab I could find nothing about online so whether it exists or not is Juby Asst it's all just a bit dodgy isn't it anyway I could make a whole video on this stuff and that's without even touching on like whether it actually works to remove heavy metal toxins from the body and that's without without even touching on the fact that vaccines don't create heavy metal toxicity like yeah I could make a whole video on this stuff but for brevity we're gonna move on go back to the original Facebook post and look at some of the responses one woman replied the toxins in vaccines are literally poisoning children's brains the heavy metals changed the chemistry of our brains the brain is responsible for cognitive cognitive function how we handle stress and depression and anxiety and addiction all of it all these toxins we consume and inject are literally changing our brain and our DNA I'm so sorry you're going through this I read this and CBD oil is helping people with depression may be something to look into can we play bingo with antibiotics Facebook post please we need like CBD oil heavy metal toxicity autism but seriously all this stuff about how the toxins and vaccines are literally poisoning children's brains and literally changing our DNA can I get a source for that please next up someone posted this with the caption the u.s. gives two to three times more vaccines than most developed countries yet we have the sickest population with skyrocketing rates of health issues like asthma childhood diabetes food allergies leukemia developmental delay ADHD autism lupus arthritis x-men epilepsy brain tumors Alzheimer's and more it's not a coincidence this is such a misrepresentation of facts it makes me sad for a start they miss out the completely obvious point that as we give out more vaccines the diseases that we're vaccinating for the numbers of cases and the numbers of deaths from those diseases drop dramatically there's a reason we don't have smallpox anymore there's a reason we don't have to worry about that and that is because of vaccines check out some of these graphs as examples I'll post the source of them below in the description and like a to that and there's a really interesting article that gets with it you can read along and very very interesting read and then the illnesses that they are claiming all rising as the number of vaccines rise it's so bizarre to me because yes there may be some correlation there but that doesn't mean there's a causational link take increased rates of asthma for example that's not because weren't vaccinating more but maybe because we have increased levels of air pollution just you know was like one possibility that there could be other reasons as well an increase childhood diabetes maybe that's to do with the insane amount of sugar that's been pumped into processed food maybe that's to it the fact that people are kind of over feeding their kids and childhood obesity is an issue and therefore childhood diabetes is an issue as well more than it was in the past take ADHD and autism for example maybe the number of diagnosed cases of those have increased because doctors and parents are more aware of them now and they don't just brush it off as bad behavior or a weird kid or whatever they actually know to look out for signs and symptoms that can lead to a diagnosis just because there's a correlation it doesn't mean there's a causation at all it is completely wrong to blame vaccines for any increase in these illnesses that are mentioned in this post take autism for example and any causal link between vaccines and autism has been disproven many many times the one paper that was written suggesting there's a link between them has been debunked it has been completely blown apart and shown to be absolute rubbish I don't know how many times I have to say it that correlation does not equal causation and just because there's a link between something it doesn't mean but one thing cause the other if you're really interested in this kind of stuff and you want more proof of it that's a fantastic website called spurious correlations that basically shows you graphs where they pump in two variables show you the correlation between them but obviously like it's insane that would there would ever be any causal link and for example this one here just because there's a correlation here it doesn't mean the increase in u.s. science spending will cause more suicides or in this one and this one makes me laugh just because there's a correlation here between the two datasets it does not mean that eating cheese will make you more likely to die by being tangled in your bedsheets although maybe this data here could be used as evidence for those people who believe they're eating cheese before bed gives you nightmares if you want to check out more spurious correlations between random sets of data you can do I'll leave the link that in the description below as well it's a really fun little website I genuinely recommend you go check it out and you can have hours of fun on there at least I can back to the Facebook post and the comments on this post in particular show just how much people are like eating this stuff up and how willing they are to believe this honestly bad science one month says and childhood cancers are up 30% in the last 30 years if you want questioning these things you're asleep at the wheel another man says that just proves that vaccines are unbalanced in the natural gut biome of the body no no no and another post I found really interesting that I think is worth talking about was this one a woman says I posted something on my page about not vaccinating and I realize now I made a huge mistake I turned off the notifications so I don't see the comments because I don't want to argue with any of my friends but I realize none of my friends know how I feel about vaccines only my fiance does I'm really glad to be in a group like this with people that are smart enough to know the truth and I feel safe posting here so thank you everyone I found this really really interesting because a lot of the time you will see people in these anti-vaxxers put groups not just this one that I'm working out here but across a lot of anti facts groups I looked at a lot of them don't cherry you see a lot of them preaching about how people who you know like cause they call us like Pro Vox they say people because you understand how vaccines work and their benefits they say that we're sheeple and you know we never question anything you're just never thinking for yourself you know you're just just going along with what those scientists say and they spent a lot of time calling us out saying that sort of stuff and yet here is an anti boxer literally saying I just want to stay in my echo chamber and have no one questioned my beliefs do they see the irony and the hypocrisy here or are they just oblivious to it I I'm genuinely intrigued this is kind of why I like to look at Facebook groups like this so because it does challenge me a bit every now and again I'll see something and think oh you know what that actually sounds quite plausible and so I'll go and I'll research it further and and so far nothing I've seen in these anti facts groups or whatever was held up to any kind of scrutiny and it's always turned out they were wrong where their points been debunked before or whatever but at least I allowed myself to be challenged and I allowed myself to go out and search for the evidence to answer questions for myself and as much as auntie whacks people say they're doing that I think post like this kind of show that maybe they're not maybe they're just happy to sit back and be surrounded by people who who just make them feel good and who reinforce their already their opinions there's a word for this isn't there I can't think what it is I'm having a dumb moment I do have to wonder if auntie faxes like this are willfully ignorant or if they genuinely don't realize what they're doing I don't know it's quite interesting in the comments to this one room wrote probe acts bullying is real I couldn't believe the amount of friends and family who cut me out just because I decided not to vaccinate I'm sorry love but it's not bullying it actually makes perfect sense it's people wanting to protect their family and friends if you don't vaccinate your children your children could potentially be carrying deadly diseases who could hurt them or people close to them vulnerable babies elderly relatives in you know compromised people people going through chemotherapy you're putting all these people at risk if you allow your unvaccinated child around them they're protecting themselves and their loved ones they're not bullying you they're not saying we don't want your unvaccinated child around our newborn baby to be mean they're saying it because they don't want their baby to die you're the one being selfish by exposing vulnerable people and your own children to these potentially deadly all life-changing diseases she goes on to say ignorance is very real and unfortunately a lot of people would rather be comfortable inside their lives of lies than learn the truth the irony here is she serious another woman says I made a post once and had an old classmate try and tell me I was putting her future children at risk and all this other nonsense well you are I don't want to feel like I'm using someone I know is like personal tragedy for views but I want to share this story which I have mentioned before on like the topic of anti facts because I feel like it's a very very important story and I want people to know that the stuff I'm talking about is real and genuine and these bad things do happen but um I grew up living down the street from a girl he's a couple of years younger than me and around this time last year she gave birth to the most gorgeous beautiful lovely little baby girl beautiful gorgeous baby I'm seeing all these pictures on Facebook you know they're having a great time it's like you know baby's first little onesie baby's first hat taking her out to dinner with them for the first time baby's first walk and then at two weeks old she contracted meningitis at 16 days old she was dead it took two days 16 days old and there was nothing the parents could have done to change it it's not their fault at all they couldn't know who was carrying the disease and it's absolutely heartbreaking for any parent to lose a kid but to lose your child at 16 days when they haven't even lived no one should have to go through that and no baby should have to suffer that if you think your own kids are strong and healthy enough to fight off such a horrible infection that's fine but spare a thought for the people who aren't strong and healthy enough to fight it off and it's not their fault that they're not that baby's death and the death of so many other babies elderly people immunocompromised people they're all preventable through herd immunity so next time an auntie boxer is sat there saying oh I don't know I'm just I'm not sure if I want to risk my kid getting autism by giving them a vaccine or spare a thought for those little two week old babies that your kid could go on to kill by not vaccinating your child you're not only putting your child at risk or you're putting innocent vulnerable people at risk too I'll say it again immunocompromised people newborn babies elderly people people going through chemotherapy people with HIV none of these people deserve to be put at risk because you don't want to vaccinate your perfectly healthy child and next up another person posted and this about how a bunch of Western leaders don't have kids so why would you think they care about yours seriously how about because one day human and still have empathy and care for other people and - it's literally their job to care about the well-being and health of everyone in their country at least there was a little logic in the comments though with this reply saying as a person who cannot have kids I find it highly offensive I'm not less aware and also I do care about the future of others so thank you to that person a little bit of logic and sanity there thank you for moving on to another post and this woman says my three-year-old is starting preschool this Wednesday I have to admit I'm a little scared I think what if he gets the measles or meningitis did I do the right thing by not vaccinating him in my heart I feel like I did and I'll just trust my motherly instincts how can I keep his immune system nice and healthy so he doesn't get sick thank you all in advance and happy and healthy New Year to to all so you know legitimate fear here I get that um if you don't want your kid to get measles or meningitis there's a really really simple thing you can do to prevent that though vaccinate them oh you want to keep his immune system healthy you notice this thing I heard about where and you can you can do this thing and it teaches his own immune system how to fight off the disease it's called vaccination and response another person says childhood disease that strengthen the immune system and provide immunity don't be afraid my children had chicken pox and measles in the early 90s when five and three and got through both fairly quickly and easily of course one anecdote means it's perfectly safe for all people so funny little story I've gone in response to this I was never vaccinated for chickenpox and I didn't catch it as a child I caught it when I was 16 nearly 17 and I felt like I was dying I had never been a sick in my life it was the most horrific thing and it was a summer holidays in school I had to miss two weeks of work which meant I missed out on a hell of a lot of money for me at the time and I was literally completely covered head to foot in blisters I'm not joking they were my entire face was covered my torso my back my arms my legs the soles of my feet they were in my ears they were in my mouth they were up my nose it was so unpleasant it was the most horrific thing I've experienced it was itchy and painful and um I couldn't wear clothes for the whole two weeks I spent the entire time and one of my mum's like overly baggy t-shirts and a pair of pants because I couldn't bear to have anything else touching me and even that was uncomfortable it was the most horrific thing and I couldn't eat I couldn't sleep and I had a horrific ly high temperature at headaches and migraines and I was dizzy and tired all the time but again couldn't sleep so it just made me worse so I was cranky I spent most of those two weeks just crying and crying my blisters had blisters on them it was that bad I don't think I had like an inch of a square inch of my skin was uncovered like nowhere like I could not put my finger on my body and not touch a blister anyway I was that covered so yeah horrible horrible you know liked it to this day now nearly 10 years on I'm still I still have scars covering my entire body like I have so on my chest I haven't feel my face I could be people who said they thought I had a piercing in my nose no it's just a really obvious chickenpox scar so one of the tip in my nose were on the side of my nose that in my eyebrows maybe a couple of my cheeks I happened on my tummy and I was all my legs and then it kind of scars that mostly aren't too noticeable to other people but I still know though that and I still get very self-conscious about them so yeah chickenpox might not be so bad for younger kids getting it but when you're a teenager or an adult it's horrific and the older you are the worse it is and oh god I still sometimes I still have nightmares where I have chicken pots and it's like I wake up and I'm sort of traumatized all over again it was the worst two weeks just uh it was horrible why would you risk letting anyone go through that or worse chicken pot is pretty mild compared to some of them you know at least chicken pox probably isn't gonna kill you and then there are all these comments saying things like well healthier children have immune systems that are designed to handle these things do you even understand how the immune system works do you even understand how vaccines work like sorry this this kind of riles me up a bit so again not going to go too deep into the science here and oversimplify this a hell of a lot so even the most basic anti-vaxxer can understand this but vaccines work because they strengthen and improve your own immune system basically they inject a completely inactive version of the virus into your body to teach your immune system how to fight it so it can recognize it in the future if you get a live version of that infecting you does that make sense just how can you not understand that it's like a thing you're learning like basic GCSE biology when you're like fifteen I did actually find the immunology modules quite interesting that I did at uni when I stood in biomed they they were really really good there's some pretty complex stuff there and it does get really interesting but again that's probably something that we're better off talking about on the podcast when we've got kind of like long-form stuff that we can really kind of dive into the science really deep and anyway well past the post and this woman says people warned me that my son would constantly be sick on sea sized a cat and he's been sick twice in the last two years your little guy will be farther off than the vaccinated kids trust me love your kid is fine not because of your alte berry syrup but because he's surrounded by kids whose parents have had them vaccinated he's protected by a third immunity not your fish oil anyway at this point I start to lose faith in humanity I think we go into this video trying can I see the best in Andrew boxes at least at this point I think I sort of understand so their motives a little bit more but I'm also kind of more mad because they don't realize the amount of people they're putting at risk and part of me is like tempted to post in these groups and be like well how do you feel about putting newborn babies at risk how do you feel about putting immunocompromised people at risk and like see what their responses like genuinely be interested to know yeah I don't know I think there's a lot more we could cover about anti-vaxxers and I'd love to kind of get into a little bit more detail about what they think the actual dangers are of vaccines I'm kind of like pin down some of those ideas a bit more I think that would be a really interesting video to do in the future maybe that's one for another day but this is getting a little bit long now obviously I haven't covered everything that every anti box of things obviously I've picked out like you know the four most recent posts from the group at the time or thought of however many it was like and literally I just went down the top few posts so obviously this isn't a completely thorough in-depth analysis analysis of the entire energy that's movement is it's not at all it's just been kind of like an introduction to the topic I thought it would be an interesting one but for now let me know your thoughts on this let me know your thoughts on the posts lemma your thoughts on my thoughts about them let me know down in the comments what are your thoughts on vaccines and the whole anti back to movement if you like this kind of science e-content I'm hoping to do a little bit more of this over the next year it should be really fun if you want to show your support for the whole you know debunking bad science movement type thing kind of you can go grab one of mine that's not how you science t-shirts from my merch store that will be really awesome because you're also supporting me and my channel and you're getting something cool that you can kind of like show off to the world hopefully I don't know basically all I met just designed by me and I had a really fun time designing it and I know it's probably not like the best best best out there but it's fun and it's very neat and I kind of love it and I have a lot of my own t-shirts no wear them all the time so I'm a big nerd like that don't judge me yeah anyway enough of this little sales pitch I'm done thank you so much for watching today you guys are amazing and I'll see you all again soon thank you so

-1,"let's let's be clear the anti-vaccine Lobby owns the internet right now they've what does that mean what that means is they've got they've put out now by some estimates 500 anti-vaccine websites so that every time you put the word vaccine into a search engine whether it's Yahoo or Google you're gonna get anti vaccine misinformation that's number one second we know now it's amplified social media like Facebook other forms of social media so third you know look at the Amazon site I mean it's it's incredible so my book this book the good news is it's I think it's right now it's the highest rated probe vaccine book on Amazon the bad news is overall it's ranked about 20 because there's 19 other phony-baloney anti vaccine books so that so the Amazon is the biggest purveyor now of anti vaccine books and wait it gets even worse then you also have now they've become politicized they have political action committees in multiple states lobbying state legislators about fault but with applying them with false information about what VAX vaccines do so and and the problem is we don't have a robust system of pro-vaccine advocacy to counter it so we don't really hear as much as we need to from the federal government from the CDC from the Surgeon General so unfortunately in this country the defense of vaccines Falls to a handful of academics like myself and you know I'm an academic I wrote a book what chance do I stand against this major media empire that why do you think that exists why do you think there is this major media empire that's against vaccines that's a great question what's the motive what's the motivation number one and number two where's the money coming from right right there's real money behind this millions of dollars behind this to put out phony documentaries and phony books what's a good phony documentary to point to well I'm a little reluctant to do it say it because they're sold it teaches opened and and you know I don't have the means to defend a lawsuit and the fact that so out there these documents which I usually don't name specific understand these documentaries what do you think their motivation is do you think the Ernest Lee believed that vaccines do cause harm or vaccines to cuts I know I use me autism I don't know I mean is there some kind of other agenda that they have I mean we do know in some cases that the some elements of the anti vaccine lobby are promoting phony autism therapies right they're doing terrible things like this thing called MMS which are bleach enemas what yeah bleach giving bleach Anna must Achatz you couldn't achieve leet why bleach because they're cleansing the immune system cleansing them of toxin oh it's really awful stuff and they're doing chelation therapy which is very dangerous what is that that's where they they claim you know kids are overdosed with toxic metals so they give a chemical that actually can chelate the metal but it can kill at your calcium and then put you into a fatal arrhythmia as well they're also who is doing this chelation therapy well you can google okay it's or whatever so these doctors like in some cases there aren't doctors unfortunately or other health professionals and what does sure you study the evidence lady gets work there's no evidence and then and then they're doing hyperbaric therapy which is really bad so and some hyperbaric therapy is bad well for it doesn't do anything for autism that's okay but it's it's good for recovering from injuries and yeah under certain selected sir but who knows what who knows what it's doing to a young kid right I mean so you shouldn't be doing that the then the other then that's one so how much of this is being driven by financial motivation peddling these phony autism therapies I can't say my sense is that's not the big piece of this yeah there's also some reports not Russian BOTS and trolls that are amplifying this and sewing political instability in Rowntree but again you add that all up the phony autism therapies the Russian Batson trolled in my mind that really doesn't get our arms around the big driver this thing so I think we really need some good investigative journalists to look in well do you think that there's some sort of a concerted effort or do you think that's your but just a bunch of people that really believe that vaccines do cause autism they don't truly understand the science and they haven't talked to someone like you and maybe they have this idea that's cemented in their mind and they're not willing to look at it objectively and look at the full spectrum of possibilities and look at the science behind what you guys are saying because in their head they've been saying vaccines cause autism they've been saying it for so long that once someone gets that and they're connected to that it's very difficult for them to shift gears people have a really hard time not being married to an idea yeah no I agree that and you know when I talk and I spend a lot of time going around the country giving what are called Grand Rounds lectures to hospitals and medical schools pediatric Grand Rounds so I've had the chance to talk to a lot of pediatricians and nurses and nurse practitioners even and more and more than a few parents my impression is most of the parents are who are called to be so-called vaccine hesitant as is the word of the day are not really deeply dug in I mean you can yeah you can have a conversation with them and explain to them like we're talking now in a very you know non-technical way you know the evidence showing vaccines don't cause autism and the lack of plausibility given that it that it begins in pregnancy and they'll vaccinate their kids there is another percentage and I don't know what the percentage is whether 10 15 percent that are deeply dug in and are wholly invested in this conspiracy theory that the that the government is in cahoots with the pharmaceutical companies and blahdy blahdy blah and then if you try to talk them out of it they just think you're part of the conspiracy so it's sort of a no-win approach there but but most parents you can have a good conversation with most parents yeah it's not necessarily even most parents right I mean what you're dealing with is these people that maybe they're into a bunch of different alternate therapies a bunch of different kinds of cleansing and you know there's a lot of that nonsense that you find online where I mean look there's legitimate but I guess but I guess my point sorry okay please no I guess my point is parents don't get the chance because they're so inundated with phony anti-vaccine information that I do a Google search yeah or whatever you know whatever search they do so what do you think should be done should there be a pro vaccine documentary that makes sense I think thanks for that question I think there's three things that need to be done I think first of all some of this anti vaccine media empire needs to be dismantled this mantis mantled and and that it was to say whether they're wrong or right like shouldn't I mean it seems like there should be some sort of a debate right like if there's someone who's saying that there's some evidence of vaccines cause debates you're saying there's no evidence of vaccines cause debate no excuse me that vaccines cause autism and you're saying there's no evidence that vaccines cause autism there should be a debate where there's some sort of a like some sort of a monitored conversation where you can have you versus someone else and break this down yeah but that that has that's a two-edged sword too because you know then it gives some false legitimacy to the anti vaccine side it's like debating the smoking caused cancer yeah but doesn't this is there already a problem I mean it seems like if there's this many if you do Google search and you're just overwhelmed right with anti value it seems like the fight has already been lost if that's the case that's right so giving them legitimacy looks like it's not necessarily giving them a legitimacy it's giving them you given you rather a forum to dismiss their legitimacy yeah I mean I think you know part of what has to be done is means and and this gets into all sorts of First Amendment issues and I'm not a lawyer but you know the the idea that Amazon now is putting out all of these phony books and phony documentaries well they're just a distributor right yeah they don't have to go over every book that they sell with a fine-toothed but maybe they should I mean I don't mind toothcomb but maybe there should be some screening maybe Amazon maybe Facebook should all be hiring chief scientific officer x' to you know putting some stops on the dissemination of information because it's harming children right i mean i mean this is the reason I get passionate about it the reason I actually wrote the book is kind interesting I it actually happened before all of these big measles outbreaks that we have been having yeah um I noticed that in Texas there was where I my laboratories at Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine we noticed that there was a steep increase in the number of kids whose parents were opting them out of getting vaccinated to the point where in Texas we have over 600 60,000 kids not getting their vaccines in the state of Texas and those are the ones we know about we don't know anything about the 325,000 homeschooled kids so we probably have over a hundred thousand kids not getting vaccinated all because of this misinformation campaign and I was really troubled by the fact that there was no response to it and that was rude of me to write the book so the point is now Texas is very vulnerable to measles outbreaks and I say measles more than the others because that's the most highly contagious disease what's the danger of a child getting measles so is there any benefit to a child getting measles in terms of their immune system no there's no benefit and that's one of the phony books they put out Melanie's marvelous measles I mean it's it's awful so um what did they say in that book they say build your immune system it does not it does not it's remember um after so let's go back a little bit smallpox was eradicated in the late 1970s through vaccination one smallpox was eradicated a kid Radek and measles was arguably the single leading killer of children globally 2.6 million children died every year measles because it causes measles pneumonia measles encephalitis talk about permanent neurologic injury that's a bad actor measles and then deafness at all and then through global vaccination campaigns we brought it down by the year 2002 about half a million kids dying and then the Gates Foundation put up 750 million dollars to create the GAVI Alliance the Global Alliance for vaccines and immunization we've brought it down now to a hundred thousand but now measles is coming back Europe's a disaster right now we've got 80,000 measles cases in 2018 in Europe and now it's coming back to the u.s. and so my worry is this me the anti vaccine media empire isn't it started out as a fringe group but now it's really affecting public health allowing a deadly disease like measles to come back do you think if there's some sort of definitive evidence that shows to the general public like you could you could show it to them like this is what causes autism we've narrowed it down to these genes and it it has nothing to do with vaccines if you give these vaccines to people without these genes there is no way they're gonna get autism they get autism specifically because of these variations in their genes you just you just summarize the book right but I mean that we need more than a book yeah it does disturb me when I hear about all these kids getting measles and and not just measles but means in some places polio is made of resurgence you know well polio you know we're down to about three three countries that still have transmission of wild-type polio it's Nigeria Pakistan Afghanistan so hopefully we're getting arms around polio but measles has now come back roaring back with a vengeance it hasn't haven't people contracted polio outside of those areas I mean those are the areas where it's a problem every now and then some cases pop up that's something you know wherever and this can get it on to a whole nother topic wherever there's collapse in health systems infrastructure yeah I was doing from war political instability these diseases can come back they can come back and the people that are vulnerable the children that are not immunized that's right and when you're immunized you're not vulnerable that's right yeah this is it's a really confusing thing for people because on the outside they were people always want to think that big pharma but I've said some terrible things about big pharma and the reason being is painkillers because painkillers and antidepressants and there's the SSRIs which are over prescribed and the painkiller one kills me because I have no people directly that have been addicted to these goddamn things and the doctors are passing them out like candy so people look at big farm as being oh these are the monsters that push this there are also the people that give you things that save people's lives yeah there's a lot going on there yeah I'm no I'm no big defender of of the big pharmaceutical companies I mean one of the things that the empty VAX the insults that anti-vaxxers hurl at me as they say I'm a shill for industry they say I'm secretly taking money from murk and the access with glads all crap I'm we don't I don't take a penny from them and I and I and that's it's not even how do you say just by the from the University I get paid by the University and some of that some of my salaries offset by not grants from nonprofit foundations then this is because like the Nationals right and then they say I'm secretly making millions of dollars for our vaccines for hookworm and schistosomiasis and Chagas what you do with all that money because my wife says if only that were the case right these are diseases of the poorest of the poor I'll never make a penny on these disease so in fact you know one of the frustrations I have with the big pharmaceutical companies is we've gotten well have made a lot of progress of their vaccines we've gone all the way from discovery through early phase process development and manufacturing an IND filing with the FDA investigational new drug applications but we're getting kind of stuck at phase one phase two clinical trials because we don't have the big pharma money to take us all the way the licensure so I've had a lot of meetings with the big pharmaceutical companies to see if they can partner with us and so far that hasn't happened so has there ever been any discussion or any interest in creating some sort of a compelling documentary that's Pro vaccinations that can counter all these things because there's there's quite a few health-related documentaries that I know are horseshit because I've talked to actual real scientists and clinical researchers that say like all these things are saying it wrong and this is why they're wrong in this you could show this that they're wrong and then when someone says hey I saw this documentary it says that all you should eat is toast you could say listen man you got to go here and watch this and it'll show you why that's nonsense right is there anything like that right now there's any discussion not right now there are some discussions but we're a long way off from that and the problem is the anti vaccine documentaries are being distributed widely sold and and those people that are talking about it here's the other problem whenever I talk to someone about as I've been doing this a lot lately or I talk to someone about something that passionate about I go what books you read on it there's like well I saw this documentary well very and in there are books yeah in ahead of mine write books that are written by actual researchers people that have spent decades in labs understanding what's going on you don't really you know you don't get a lot of that from the people that are anti anything right well that's that's what I wrote the new book it's a very confusing thing for parents because you're scared you know you have this little tiny baby that you love more than anything in this world and then the doctors say hey we've got this round of vaccines coming and you're just terrified that you're gonna do something to your child's can you turn your child into someone who's compromised yeah and and the point is problem is these diseases are back now and so it the agency to vaccinate is now more than ever I mean remember right now look what's going on in Vancouver Washington right now where the measles outbreak is underway the ones who are at greatest risk are infants under the age of 12 months not yet old enough to get their vaccine so that if you're a parent right now living in Vancouver Washington you're terrified you're terrified about taking your baby out the Walmart er cuz they can break that vaccine will never get you access right right so now the disease is coming back because the older kids are catching it and the antigen and the empty vaccine Lobby uses terms like personal liberties and medical freedom well where the personal liberties of this parent now who terrified the taker and when you say to her infant anti vaccine Lobby know I know that Robert Kennedy jr. is he's a he's a big one he's a big one and he seems like a very intelligent guy how could he not be aware of the science behind this and what is he getting wrong what what he's getting wrong is just about everything you know he's formed an organization called children's health defense and and start he had a press conference about it I think it was September October of last year it is probably one of the best organized anti vaccine groups out there now he's doing other things other than vaccines he's doing a lot of things about environmental health and things like that I don't know any part of that business I've only followed what they what he does with vaccines but it's all it's all nonsense why is he doing this about vaccines don't know what's as well I mean you have to ask him what what's his motive would he be a guy that you would want to have a debate with or have a discussion with but again I mean I'm I'm uncomfortable with the idea of a debate because it's like it's like debating I don't know it's like debating a Holocaust denier or whether the Holocaust exists I mean not that this rises I understand what you're saying but if you're again I want to bring this up if you're complaining there's 19 books ahead of yours that are anti-vaccine books you've already lost the battle like it's time to regroup and maybe regrouping would be confronting someone with actual scientific information I mean you are a real doctor you're a guy who actually studies this and you're a man who understands the science you're a legitimate academic you could you could actually put a dent in this with a real conversation yeah potentially potentially yeah I mean what would he be able to say like what is his take on it well remember he's uh he's an attorney and he's he's very clever right and right now he knows how to presumably knows how to do arguments in court and what am i I'm a scientist right but do you think that he wants to deceive people or do you think that maybe he's just incorrect in his accumulation of data yeah I can't say what his motivation is but um his his his information is is highly misleading hmm now what else is you say the lobby is this an organized thing good question I mean again we need somebody who really wants to do a deep dive in this and kind of dissect out the pieces yeah to understand but it's it's impressive what you've got out there in terms of the hundreds of websites and the amplification on social media and everything else is it are there just one or two or three groups behind it or is it a random collection of organizations right that that needs to be looked at"
0,"I wish there was just more compassion. No, we don't want to make something difficult. We just want to be acknowledged My daughter was a victim and she's being punished Hi, my name is Marissa Gold I am a parent I have two girls, ten and thirteen and I'm also a parenting expert with my own parenting company 'Intuit Parenting'. My name is David Epstein and I'm a pediatric intensive care physician. I'm Gary Shlifer. I'm an internal medicine physician I'm Bob Sears. I'm a pediatrician. I guess my greatest passion is just to help encourage a full complete informed consent for vaccinations. I'm also Marissa. By trade am a designer. I am also an activist and a mother I'm Melissa Floyd and I would consider myself an informed consent advocate I just want to make sure this conversation can be open for people and continue to inform people and to listen to everyone to understand Why we each come to our opinion on this The first statement is: I am vaccinated So I actually wasn't fully vaccinated interestingly I grew up with two parents that were into alternative medicine So I was not vaccinated as a child, but as I got older I vaccinated myself. Marisa: Well, I was Vaccinated as a child But my last vaccine was about 15 years ago when I returned to college and I had a severe reaction and that I became arthritic in my hands. Went to many many doctors and Nobody knew what was going on and why it was happening and just shocked like it doesn't make sense You're too young to have arthritis and it wasn't until having kids and sort of digging into my own research for them That a lot of answers started coming up and I think it's unfortunate that a lot of it is overlooked For me and I'll continue to get vaccinated regardless of The risks because I've seen too many things on the other side I've seen kids, you know come into the ICU and die from being, uh, getting the flu I've always felt like the the risks are far outweighed by the benefits of getting the protection Not getting vaccinated endangers other people I Will acknowledge, of course as a pediatrician I know vaccines work. I know they give you protection They vary greatly in what that protection is. It's not like 100% magical shield over you completely but I do acknowledge there are some vaccines like the measles vaccine and the chickenpox vaccine, that honestly if you don't get those vaccines Yeah, you do risk catching the disease and passing it to others. It's such a complicated topic Vaccines and you're starting to get micro with each individual vaccine and definitely the question was Talking about the big picture and I think yeah If you get micro, probably some of these vaccines I think when you're giving kids medication you have to get micro about it I don't think it's doing your kids any service to just say X things are all made the same and they're all safe and healthy good for you that everybody's Benefiting from it because that's false it's not true Well, we study them before we release them to the public we study them so we do know they're safe That's the thing is we know. Safe-ish. You know being an intensive us I see the worst of the worst and so seeing The other side of kids who don't get vaccinated. I saw a kid walking in with meningococcemia Which I haven't seen in decades. He had all four limbs cut off They had to be amputated because it was all dead tissue. You forget how bad things were before we had vaccines I didn't step forward for that because I don't like the assumption that If a child is unvaccinated somehow they are of risk to everyone and also knowing that Vaccinated individuals can also be caring and spreading diseases I think it's very polarizing to separate the two as if if you're vaccinated. You're totally fine. You're not risking Anybody anything unvaccinated children don't just have diseases hanging out in their bodies waiting to unload at any moment Anybody could be spreading diseases, especially things like polio and pertussis that are not completely covered by the vaccine. I'd do anything to keep my child safe I agree I don't have kids but when I think about it, you know The idea with vaccines is you're protecting all of us you're protecting the group, you know There's this idea of herd immunity. And so I think that's why it's really important to talk about because This is an issue. That doesn't just affect you It affects everyone around you because there's people that aren't vaccinated that are sick or have immune issues Or they're too young to get a vaccine and they count on her immunity I think most people too like I started out Vaccinating my daughter because I believed all the same things that you said it wasn't until she had a reaction and several reactions that I actually had to look at it differently where I I realized by continuing vaccinating for her that actually would hurt her and yet everyone wants me to do it for the population As if I'm supposed to continue to sacrifice my child for everyone else well I mean there are medical exemptions for for vaccines and if your child has a reaction and then there's some there's concern I think that's valid but I think a larger population is using other Justifications to not get the vaccines, you know a number of families who look into vaccines they will decide to opt out of vaccines because they feel they are just not willing to Risk the side effects, but the side effects are the side effects are like one in a million one in two million whereas the side effects from the diseases when I see all these outbreaks and things like I'm gonna choose vaccines every time and that's I think right there is the disservice to this conversation because It is a risk benefit analysis. And what's unfortunate is how downplayed those risks are I only started investigating vaccines because I ended up with a kid with an autoimmune disorder So, what does that mean and instead of finding answers? I found more questions. The one in a million is not a real number And so you're more that that is put out Is it so people think that no, well not when you're talking about the different kind of reactions I think the number you're referring to is anaphylactic shock that anaphylactic shock is of course extremely rare Whereas you when you look at seizures from the MMR vaccine are one in 3,000 But again this creates fear in parents. Well we worry what we worry that you get those on your side kind of downplay those so my daughter had seizures. Seizures for most people are considered kind of a big deal, you know when it happens to you that that Downplayed element of well, that's not anaphylactic shock. It's just a seizure. It is just a seizure but seizures can be dangerous I don't think it's an idea of downplay I think it comes back to what we were saying with the risk benefit analysis and I think the data is very clear that the Benefits of giving vaccines by far outweigh the risks so I don't think it's a question of downplaying the risks. They're there but we also know that children were dying and now they're not and yes, there's side effects, but they're not as bad as what we had before vaccines I don't always trust my doctor's opinion Anytime anyone whether it's a teacher a friend something I read online my mom, you know my doctor anytime anyone tells me Oh, you should do this especially if it has to do with their health I'm going to do research and it's I would be Careful about saying it's that I don't trust my doctor, but that has that trust has been developed over time And so I would say in the early years when my children were very young when they would say this is what we recommend Yes, of course there were times where I got a second opinion or did the research on my own and asked the questions and I think that as parents We have to do that well, it's hard to trust someone who sees your child for 10 minutes twice a year in the end parents know their children best and That little office visit where your pediatrician looks at your child He does not know your child the way you know your child, so it's really hard for whatever recommendation He's making to be really based and individualized for your kid So if you were to come to your doctor and say hey, my child's acting differently after this this well visit appointment Something's wrong You want them to trust that you have an established Relationship and listen to you and hear you and understand that as a mother Just because you don't have the dr in front of your name. It doesn't make your opinion somehow less valuable yeah, I mean I think like anyone doctors are fallible and they don't know everything and I think it's very important like you're Mentioning to have a really strong Doctor-patient relationship. I think that's really hard in today's ten-minute appointment age, you know makes it really difficult but like as a young doctor I think there's a lot of distrust when it comes to physician Recommendations it sucks because you know you spend decades training and learning and your heart is in this place where you want to like be of service to people and then You're not trusted but you know to answer the question You shouldn't just blindly trust anyone's opinion your doctor or anyone. Ironically the doctors are the ones that-  Well, I trust my physicians My daughter has epilepsy and in March she was also diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis I went to the rheumatologist and the rheumatologist said we're gonna put her on methotrexate and I looked at her I'm like  methotrexate That's a chemotherapy Kimber therapeutic agent that you know kids with cancer again and she's like, yes But we use it in a low dose and it doesn't cause harmful side effects. You have to trust me. I said okay and I trusted her And I am so glad that I did before all this happened. She was a competitive gymnast and She used to walk up and down the stairs. Like she was 90 years old. She couldn't hold a pencil in her hand now she's back on the bars and back on the on the beam doing things which my wife and I Never thought that she would do again. So yes, do I trust my physicians? Yes. Do I question them? Yes, I will say look can we do this for her? Can we do this instead? And yes, you know I, I can appreciate what you guys have said as far as people hearing you and I think that's the biggest problem in medicine is that Time is short clinicians aren't listening and I think that as as a pediatrician You know one of the most important jobs That we have is to listen to parents and I think that if any pediatrician isn't doing that, they're not doing their job   I don't like it I don't I want us to be able to talk I want us to be able to have Relevant and educated conversations and I think at the core of this conversation is What is at the core of humanity and being a parent? Which is that we all want to do right by our children and we want to lead happy healthy and productive lives Yeah, I have no doubts in my mind of how I've come to my decision making on the subject which has been Tedious and thorough to say the least I did not expect to go down this path in my life But I have people who won't be friends with me who I've had death threats on social media I might not even be able to send my kids to school depending on how legislation changes because of the way I think it just it's insane to me how hostile this has become and it's not doing a service to Research and science moving forward and just the overall dialogues we have in our culture whatever the subject what I think is lacking in this debate or conversation is really Compassion from the pro vac side or pro mandate side. I'll say the people who Refuse to acknowledge that vaccine reactions are happening or that the things that happened to my daughter were Connected because maybe it was just a coincidence and I just needed something to pin it on you are socially isolated You can be isolated by your family isolated by the medical community isolated by society as a whole because they assume you're Unintelligent uneducated and irrational. I wish there was just more compassion that no We don't want to make something difficult. We just want to be acknowledged My daughter was a victim and she's being punished what I signed up for this it was a little bit of trepidation Coming into this because you do hear things in the media You know about the people who are anti vaccine and the way they respond to physicians and it is a little bit scary you know as Physicians we care about people there is compassion on on the medical community side We wouldn't do this if we if we didn't care but again, you know I do have compassion for the families that have gone through issues with you know, with vaccines and I have a great deal compassion for the families that had children die from preventable diseases There shouldn't be any hostility. There should be discussion. I mean we can always question things That's how we of all that's how we get better. If we didn't question anything we'd be still in the dark ages Hey guys, I'm Kendra I'm Erin and we're from Jubilee media.

0,robert de niro made headlines last week when he appeared on today with me and Savannah to talk about the 15th anniversary of the Tribeca Film Festival the conversation turned into a broader discussion about the claim that autism is linked to vaccines the claim that's been widely discredited by the medical community well soon after that interview there i sat down with robert de niro and Jane Rosenthal the cofounders of the Tribeca Film Festival we talked about the future of film the 40th anniversary of taxi driver and I asked an arrow about how he felt about pulling the anti vaccine documentary vast from the festival lineup I still have mixed feelings about it we wanted it to be in we decided to pull it because I didn't want to pull the the festival in a direction but it was from filmmakers according to Jane and so I said let me just let it take it out but I'm not a hundred percent sure that was the right thing to do ultimately next time I'll know hopefully more clearly about when presented with a situation like this but there is something definitely there right with VAX and there is something going on with the CDC the pharmaceutical industry people should read the reviews of the film because there are things in the film that put aside the point that you're making there are some issues in the film from its consistency from somebody saying one thing 20 minutes in and then reverses their point of view there are inaccuracies in any film any documentary and so I don't really and I'm not defending it in that way I don't I don't know but there are accuracies or things that you have to question and that's my reason for having the film for question to question certain things or open it up for discussion pros and cons there's something that is not quite kosher in all of this that's all I can say but in a sense with this controversy probably more people will see this movie yeah they should they should well it was only supposed to be it was only going to be in a hundred and twenty seat screening so now people are going to say well what's the what's the deal and exactly seek it out they'll do their own research which I'm doing to you talk another topic that's got a lot of people talking is the 40th anniversary of taxi driver De Niro earning an Oscar nomination playing the disgruntled Vietnam vet Travis Bickle when you look back at this was I in that I get a small role okay complete it back we won't have to wait too long this week he's reuniting with cast members for a special talk and screening the looking forward to seeing it again ya know I am and with everybody I mean actually I think I might have looked at it maybe 20 years ago give or take a few years when Paul Schrader and I were talking and Marty about doing a I don't know if he called it a sequel but where Travis Bickle would be later on in his life we're not looking back on iconic roles De Niro is busy embracing the future of storyteller at the Tribeca Film Festival everything from virtual reality to interactive projects are showcased in the exhibit story scoops it's called the Tribeca Film Festival but yet I mean now even virtual reality goes in there's snapchat today there's all these different media opportunity today because I mean it really is more than than just without question it probably should be called the Tribeca festival now you have new storytellers new creators coming from all these different places and the festival loves technology as long as you can tell a good story with it Bob have you been kind of intrigued by this proliferation of a different way to tell a story I have and some of it I don't understand but I remember when I when I was when I saw my older kids looking at but you know it's all great Tribeca Film vessel now going through this weekend will feature a virtual arcade through the 23rd you just a call Robert De Niro Baum amazed mr.

-1,um could we count on you to support and affirm the human right of voluntary medical risk-taking for all medical procedures including vaccines yeah no you can't count on me for that here's the thing I think that that vaccinations in this world you're right there are risks that are that are that are absolutely part of every type of medical treatment we have there are risks involved with all of it but I will tell you this two vaccines have done enormous good in this country to eradicate awful disease we want a polio in this country anymore the way we did in earlier years because of the vaccine measles mumps rubella have been in large measure eradicated because of the effective use of vaccine and I understand that as a parent you're always gonna have concerns about your child your child is the most precious thing in your life we also have to be concerned about public health and so to me when weighing it and balancing it as you and Pyun your question there has to be a weighing and a balancing I balance in favor of vaccinating our children now each vaccine has to be judged on its merits and has to go through the approval process and do all the rest of the things that we have to do to have a vaccine brought to market in this country but I cannot be someone who supports voluntary vaccinations I think that would be the wrong step for the public health of our country
-1,"at this Minneapolis Medical Clinic signs in English and Somali greet patients alerting them to measles symptoms in less than a month nearly 70 cases of the infectious disease have been diagnosed in the Minneapolis area all but a few of the patients were children and most were Somali nurse ad Nagata has been overwhelmed by concerned Somali patients who want to vaccinate their children but fear it could cause autism they're wanting to know the differences you know I want to vaccinate my children but I'm also worried about this so they are wanting a peace of mind from us from the healthcare community while measles continues to be one of the leading causes of death among young children globally the World Health Organization says the measles mumps and rubella vaccine has prevented more than 20 million deaths annually children are supposed to be vaccinated between 12 and 15 months of age up until about a decade ago the vaccination rate in the Somali community in Minneapolis mirrored that of the overall community was about 90% but since that time vaccination rates have been declining over unsubstantiated fears linking vaccinations to autism the US Centers of Disease Control and the National Institute of Health say there is no connection between vaccinations and autism the Minnesota Department of Health is making that case as well Chanukah so aah hyah hyah - Mankato Minnesota Department of Health - for weeks now Health Department outreach workers have been calling families whose children haven't been vaccinated urging them to do so the department says outreach is making a difference Somali organization was thedi birthday before this outbreak and now we are seeing five hundred vaccinations birthday it is 17 fold it has increased tremendously now still the department's infectious disease director is worried to date 8,000 Minnesotans have been exposed to measles in this latest outbreak measles is a very severe disease and 21 of the 69 cases have been hospitalized so you know it's not it's not just a childhood disease it can be very serious and people yes people do die for measles we had three deaths in 1990 the Health Department hopes with additional outreach it will be able to keep this outbreak from spreading further Diane Esterbrook al-jazeera Minneapolis"

0,starting today kids in Oregon can be sent home from school if they're not up to date with their immunizations or if they don't have proof of an exemption and it's those exemptions that are sparking debate as measles continues to spread across the country the Oregon Legislature is now trying to eliminate the philosophical waivers but the proposal would still allow for medical and religious exemptions so is it time for the federal government to step in or should these decisions be left up to the states well you've got some kids and I know you were just doing those pictures of measles and little bits you know what it's hard to look at the at the sick little ones and I've spoken on this before I mean I think that there's a way to get everybody to the table and I think that's what these lawmakers need to be doing do we need big government to tell people to have shots don't we already have that like if you've traveled to a foreign country you have a checklist so that you don't get sick when you go there I mean we know in public schools that there's certain things that the kids need to be immunized for but my big thing and things that I've talked with doctors experts about is do we really need 35 shots before they're 36 months yes we Pryor prioritize these can we put on the list the things that we've knocked out polio measles can we put those on a short list and have real conversations with those parents who have exceptions and try to meet them in the middle so that we can create that herd immunity of about 90% of the population can we get there without the government standing in and stamping it on our hands that's right and I think that's what people are afraid of right I mean I think a lot most people will go measles yeah we should probably shots but I think they're afraid of opening that door and what else we saw the government before with HP the HPV virus and and other shots that they could make those mandatory right but the problem is herd immunity doesn't work unless unless the herd is immunized and only 90 percent of it though I think it's got to be closer to 95 96 494 well I don't I don't believe in doctors I don't have kids but I won't vaccinate them because they're not real I would probably I would 100% vaccinate them you do stay away I if you're not sure if your kid should be vaccinated I say take a look at the fact that it's a bunch of Hollywood people who are saying they shouldn't be and realize that you should do the opposite of I thought it was just a bunch of crazy right-wingers yeah no no okay good I'm glad we cleared that up the media is reporting otherwise but I mean you bring up a good point about you know not just should you have it but in my case with my kids my concern was when I had a baby nine ten months ago and I didn't want to give her shots as soon as she was born so I think there's lots of things it's time and I went through that too what it's that Harris makes I think the the best point and it's it's something that you know I know that my mom feels strongly about this my younger brother was autistic and the proximity of the vaccinations do they need as Harris said all of these shots on their teeny tiny little immune system in that compressed amount of time and we actually had dr. Manning here and we asked why on outnumbered why and his answer was one of the big reasons was cost it's more cost-effective for the doctor and the parent and I thought cause but if you're a parent and you want to try and do everything to protect your child you would pay any amount of money I mean it just seemed to me that I would pay more money to have the shots spaced out and have more doctor visits and push to have something like that and if that's the case and I'm not a doctor but if that's the case Rachel then parents should definitely explore that up right don't you think that you know these people like Hillary Clinton I mean by the way she doesn't sent a tweet out on Isis but she has sent one out on vaccines and it seems like a lot of these big government supporters when it comes to vaccines or you know these are seeing people they're all for choice on all kinds of other things right not on timing not on which vaccine right I think you have to also preserve the religious exemption and some of these medical exemptions I mean there may be some reasons that someone may not be able to have a by-product that exists in that vaccine I know a lot of people who can't take flu shots for whatever we own so you have to be able to preserve that you have to leave some of this to the states and you have to leave it with the parents there has to be a way I think you're 100% right for parents if you're going to stand up for parental rights then you have to stand up for the rights of those parents to determine what's best for their kids and this is a big part of that so I respect these parents that are taking issue with the way the state government and the federal government potentially could mandate that they take care of that vaccinate your kids you know it's gonna it's gonna mean that people are gonna have to communicate at high levels in order for that to happen yeah the 10% that is less that can still build hurt amenity herd immunity you don't need 100 you need 90 it should leave some space for all those people right you should have about 10% of playroom but that means these agencies have to talk to each absolutely
-1,"(lively upbeat music) - The effectiveness of the flu vaccine is always a question
 that you hear every year. And I think the way to address that is not so much talking
 about the effectiveness but what it prevents. And so in the pediatric literature we really know that the flu vaccine prevents children from dying from the flu. And so that's a very dramatic example, but there are other examples
 about preventing days off work and preventing respiratory illness."
