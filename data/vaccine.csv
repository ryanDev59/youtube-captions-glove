weird lights sky sightings mythical creatures — lot fun ask half forums internet also good remember world shrouded mystery fascinating exploration cool speculation end six mysteries — easter island statues will-of-the-wisps — scientists managed solve talked kinds weird weather scishow might one best horrifying stories yet imagine march 1876 living bath county kentucky outside beautiful perfectly clear spring day unthinkable happens starts rain chunks meat small — 5 5 centimeters — others big hand soon yard covered stuff wish could say true story yeah 19th-century version “ cloudy chance meatballs ” actually happened according new york times two guys even tasted meat rain — curious — decided either mutton venison event came called kentucky meat shower baffled people decades originally one person thought culprit something called nostoc — know kind bacteria covered jelly-like membrane rains membrane swells except raining meat shower happened idea tossed window eventually though scientists figure studying preserved samples found meat meat — specifically mixture animal lung tissue muscle cartilage later 1876 chemistry professor l.d kastenbine discovered came synchronized projectile vomiting vultures story amazing two species vulture native kentucky eating habits totally explained shower one vultures picky eaters various kinds tissue meat pieces different sizes importantly vultures also frequent vomiters vultures known eat huge meals disturbed time digest food sometimes throw make lighter make escape easier kastenbine concluded day kentucky group vultures happened flying overhead puked time possible even happened places cases well-documented either way yeah little gross kentucky meat shower never going gross explanation easter island southeast pacific famous giant statues called moai built least 400 years ago rapa nui people polynesia lesser-known fact statues used little reddish hats okay maybe “ little ” understatement hats two meters across weighed 12 metric tons 2018 pretty unclear rapa nui managed put statues moai 10 meters tall hats really heavy also hundreds years ago cranes little scarce side using modeling team finally figured 2018 paper published journal archeological science researchers discovered rapa nui likely used technique called parbuckling first would carved stones cylinders red rock actually found side easter island making cylinder allowed roll moai built ramp leading statue ’ head tied rope around cylinder team probably 15 people hauled ramp put top statue hat carved final shape sounds like figuring would easy since based simple machines might learned elementary school discovering required building 3d models 50 statues 13 cylinders well making kinds calculations weight rocks strength average ancient polynesian today probably see many hats still moai since weather erosion knocked least longer mystery scientists tell us predict earthquake since many variables keep track tell ‘ quakes people sometimes reported seeing mysterious lights sky called earthquake lights take kinds forms blue flames lightning shoots ground people recorded seeing far back 1600s observed weeks major earthquakes 160 kilometers epicenter unsurprisingly people blamed lights ufos others thought caused disruptions earth ’ magnetic field real answer came 2014 paper published seismological research letters authors investigated data 65 earthquakes people reported seeing lights found likely culprit electrical activity certain types rocks especially volcanic ones team discovered put lot stress rocks release electric charge pressure causes chemical bonds certain compounds rocks break releases charged oxygen atoms enough bonds broken — like big earthquake — bunch charged atoms rush surface usually fault two sheets rock meet burst above-ground ionize air giving /air molecules/ electric charge ultimately creates various flashes light conditions pretty specific explains earthquake lights seen 0.5

tonight new study federation american immigration reform finds country 's approximately 11 million illegal immigrants cost taxpayers 135 billion dollars per year medical education law enforcement expenses offset taxes yet according study illegal immigrants pay 19 billion year taxes leaves deficit pay 116 billion even washington standards huge number put perspective americans spend 70 billion every year paying tuition public colleges universities eliminate expenses illegal immigrants could make every public college country tuition-free still nearly 50 billion dollars left know fix decaying infrastructure subsidize health insurance middle class probably lot worth considering debate border control amnesty numbers also another set numbers center immigration studies chain migration advocates new york washington tell immigration always pretend economic rationale important like every immigrant high qualified expert coveted field needs sake economy fact according numbers government numbers typical immigrant you.s simply related somebody already usually previous immigrant according dhs data recent years every so-called initiating immigrant first one brought average 3.5 family

immigrants older 50. become you.s citizens become eligible social security medicare despite paying little programs none attack anyone individual willing believe people immigrants good people likely good people still extremely expensive proposition america far people understand ought weigh heavily congress debates passing amnesty daca beneficiaries supposedly benefit small group limited group illegal immigrants came kids 700 000 daca recipients become legal citizens course rules chain migration bring many estimates suggest millions including parents siblings may also entered country illegally wherever question serious matters deserve serious debate congress yet count happening left interest admitting many immigrants possible sake getting holding political power whole game right right many republicans care pleasing business interests fund campaigns would like see labor costs kept low possible low-wage immigration certainly concerns regular voters worry ability stay afloat

see anti-vaccination movement phenomenon understood instead making yet another statement yes vaccines good autism let us use science understand fewer fewer people getting children vaccinated hank green scishow first let us discuss ended imagined link vaccinations autism first place autism diagnoses definitely rise many scientists believe largely even completely effective diagnosis changes diagnosis reported diagnoses autism increasing say sure whether incidence autism also increasing must environmental factor talk autism really referring range developmental disorders affect person ’ ability communicate socialize develop patterns behavior become pretty specific inflexible condition manifest lot different ways probably heard referred together autism spectrum disorder asd asd found strong genetic components also seem environmental factors work well really root controversy — simply know precisely causes autism absence explanations people try make sense way brains almost entirely cognitive bias cognitive bias really anything skews process interpret new information tons different kinds bias -- biases us ignore certain data others lead us put much emphasis certain data even drive us focus facts actually irrelevant observing essentially hear hypothesis think “ yeah ‘ makes sense ’ ” really saying “ yeah fits cognitive biases. ” people blame sorts things autism ... plastics pesticides use anti-depressants pregnancy gmos sugar gut bacteria vaccines basically start whatever makes sense person hypothesizing onset autism typically happens one two ways either parents notice delay language development typically around first birthday notice apparently sudden loss existing development might happen way third birthday humans pattern recognition machines need able figure behaviors strategies lead positive outcomes even lookout things lead negative outcomes over-weighting negative outcomes well known psychological effect called “ negativity bias. ” imagine wake one morning car work brain going want know happened leave lights drive though huge puddle yesterday maybe shorted something reason start hand get 15 year old car starts fine bad week barely getting going tend wonder “ went right ” spend far cognitive resources attempting figure bad thing happened trying determine something good happened psychology search explanations called “ explanatory attribution ” different people different “ explanatory styles ” people prone blame others search external event blame one thing clear bad blaming anything surprising parents children autism especially

action average parent vaccinate child vaccinating least two times dangerous vaccinating perception future regret parents report feel worse take action harms child act child harmed failure act perception potential regret strong even bringing choice acting versus acting seems counter-productive 2013 study found attempts convince parents vaccinate children actually decreased percentage went choose vaccination vaccination presented personal choice instead necessity good public health potentially harmful inaction seem moral potentially harmful action vaccination rates go parents choosing “ let nature take course. ” might expect effect much stronger people measurable “ naturalness bias. ” tendency perceive things come nature inherently less threatening things invent one way psychologists measure bias asking subject would prefer substance extracted herb one synthesized lab even chemically identical course others biases big government big corporations ideas vaccinations fit well

know like sengoku jidai simply hard find translations obscure records case dealing culture keep written records go scant accounts european traders oral histories collected decades fact much going tell especially early period covering best guesses historians archaeologists worked tirelessly piece together puzzle exactly transformed zulus tribe perhaps small 1,500 people living area probably around 10 square miles empire 250,000 people ruling area roughly size new jersey caveat let us start laying background zulu people began life look like subsist government economy military well relatively minor tribe within larger bantu people occupied region would eastern part south africa largely pastoral economy wealth measured cattle population mostly subsisting maize milk operated kingship little way would consider centralized governance war well story begins somewhere end 18th century warfare region ritual affair destructive endeavor warriors would meet predetermined location fling spears insults one another would rarely move close quarters fighting left casualties light almost unheard winning side follow victory chasing opponents sacking conquering land instead battles would result transfer small amount territory cattle shaka central figure early part story changed changed weapons tactics perhaps importantly philosophy war region brought close quarters combat replacing traditional long throwing spear shorter thrusting spear devastating used melee developed system envelopment tactics known bullhorn formation explain detail later changed war means settling minor disputes activity slaughter conquest shaka shaka eldest son leader zulu people considered illegitimate named heir zulu kingdom fact name shaka means intestinal beetle sort cover story mother 's untimely pregnancy becomes kind hilarious realize west often call shaka zulu since word zulu actually means heaven zulu language basically calling intestinal beetle heaven enjoy anyway age 7

notice shaka 's unusual prowess close combat fighter discovered shaka actually royal blood put charge ibuto basically think regiment shaka really began refine tactics traditional ibuto armed long throwing spears practiced use weapons much terms practicing unit tactics generally would show battlefield loose mob cohesive fighting unit shaka began experiment armed men short stabbing spear drilled tactic called bullhorn would split men three groups chest horns loins chest would charge enemy pin hand-to-hand combat two branches horns positioned either side chest would flank envelop pinned enemy whole time loins would sit behind lines acting rested reserve applied needed interestingly said shaka would men sit backs fighting would become panicked charge eagerly needed brilliance system simple without much battlefield coordination every man knew supposed chest charge horns get around flank system 's simplicity meant could applied chaotic conditions without much signalling required modern armies deadly new weapons tactics shaka became force reckoned father died decided time take shaka 's half-brother legitimate heir took zulu throne help dingiswayo shaka quickly assassinated simply moved take place dingiswayo still chief zulus shaka continued serve year later dingiswayo killed man named zwide ruler ndwandwe one powerful tribes region shaka vowed vengeance leaders death stepped

0,could describe season finale game thrones one word would display disappointing game thrones ended honest kind sucked despite may think looking title video actually used like show read first book back middle school definitely allowed started fourth book realized making mistake books really numbers back got confused alright point long time ago never could anticipated back nerdy ass books would spawn popular show ever mean popular elmo even watches think show definitely step shows type mean think many fantasy shows even come close quality game thrones problem show really dropped ball like really screwed shot final scenes yet happy things ended show fell victim something always warn bad writing talk bad writing like every video ever made seen finale show hope realize writing important show pretty good acting pretty good cinematography incredibly impressive effects moments really fun editing yet everybody mad writing bad honestly thing wrong show bad really makes hard appreciate rest stuff know many movies shows saved good writing hell reason woody allen slash career watch game thrones way beginning end feels like everything important first kind gets thrown away show morphs something bizarre themes idea important completely gone replaced generic fantasy tropes something feel right anymore one thinks let us take look oh way obvious weirdo never watched game thrones mind missing cultural media milestones explain general premise story revolves around bunch families land westeros westeros fantasy land dragons magic dragons magic pretty rare aforementioned families fighting king dies series political intrigue realistic complex characters boobs however end series kind stops show characters politics characters used get wit creativity fighting remember said magic dragons pretty rare well anymore writers know either get magic dragon fight sometimes get three writers good writing show yes know sounds little weird going explain song ice fire series written george rr martin good 80 show adapted books 75 actually really good show written david benioff db weiss lot people like call worth pretty good adapting material screen good way cutting unnecessary stuff accentuating important elements might immediately important presenting fresh engaging way lot recent seasons let us forget good stuff partly work guys pretty good adapting existing material problem well problem around season 4 5 ran books see unfortunately books finished signed show probably thought series would found hard way george rr martin kind lazy mean kind hard say really get guy first three books mere two years normal pretty quick pace five years books three four six years books four five book five came eight years ago release book six sight still supposed book one personal theory always remained jorge kind knew going able finish books time show decided wait show finish honestly better marketing choice even though know really cares mean think show like season six way done adapting books directly releases book completely going read show still would confusing consume two stories named thing knows show like popular thing ever releases book unnecessary competition better books hype show died bit either way point ran books tidbits george outside elements guys really good started writing original content got worst plot lines game thrones history also got worst dialogue mention fight scenes also start popping randomly distract viewer fill time game thrones used like one fight season lucky later seasons feels like fights get added reason shirt whole scenario reminds full metal alchemist original anime ran manga adapt started game thrones went exact way except books show us missing ask obvious yeah north wall back unfucked dragon madman kind person mean look whole hodor reveal one last things based material directly provided cool creative like bran sends mind back time like time splices jung-ho doors mind damages brain forever even explain properly conceptual strange know goobers make unfortunately show stopped creative nuanced fantasy series submerged expectations interesting ways main character season one traditional fantasy protagonist righteous good-natured almost solves problems series right away kill one trope inversion always loved revenge series deals traditional fantasy story taught root characters driven vengeance see justice know something bad punished song ice fire takes twists vengeful characters almost always punished kill every one kill get girls back kill oh usually blinded lust revenge often pay steep price arya 's whole deal earlier seasons wanting exact vengeance people ruined life kind childish every character interacts tells goal stupid worth key kind looks like going allow would old ways give petty quest writers kind forgot becomes learn give quest petty wrong everybody wanted kill already dead everybody else punished vengeance arya gets walk away scot-free fact almost every main character ruined end show personal stories become forgotten kind become standard version like writers took base qualities character use rest show decided want write character arcs honestly think single character good arc season aside theon characters also become incredibly stupid mean listen writers explain danny could see fleet pirate ships dragon gets shot danny kind forgot fleet euron 's forces forgot yeah characters stupid every single one like everybody dropped like 20 iq points last two seasons let us go ahead look characters writers daenerys targaryen alright let us get girl way early people probably suffers season goes slightly petulant confident young ruler megalomaniacal tyrant episodes yes episodes people saying fall dark side foreshadowed people correct danny 's fall dark side abrupt jarring anakin skywalker 's somehow still higher body count daenerys whole arc proving break cycles world know name breaker chains supposed literal figurative wants break cycle family line wants prove powerful ruler without tyrant knows westeros war long time people ruling land corrupt evil wants prove land thrive right person wants end cycle suffering everybody 's experiencing yeah never really liked daenerys part reason never finished rest books hate enjoying chapter turning boring character follow mean wanted arc get thrown dumpster goes normal confident strong daenerys one episode kind sad nobody westeros friend killing countless innocent people pretty drastic jump honest current theory george told going happen daenerys end story honestly board think case case known actually cultivate ark long stands comes nowhere actions speak louder words dany always completely separate threatening enemies fire blood way different killing innocent people indiscriminately example dark streak executes people betray disobey well got news every world john time first lesson series teaches us first episode authority figure responsibility got even means carrying execution act never shown bad thing series ever accept foreshadowing turning evil point basically societal norm yeah really really really wanted make evil totally doable seeds grown something convincing far know based everything show actually shown us nothing kind benevolent comes innocent people also want point stannis killed one innocent child every viewer show hated seriously hated character show yes kid tired lot people saying oh well since got westeros friends died nobody nobody likes okay arya lost family friends daenerys mass murderer okay well kind different way blatant character assassination ever seen tv show wonder everybody immediately turned show moment women children toasted main character really care something upsetting happening game problem told genuine character arc really fact go ahead fix problems one solution completely removed bells surrender scene would make little sense think daenerys know trying take city cersei would surrender like matter happened cersei would daenerys make choice either give probably would keep attacking city would put innocent lives risk much natural reasonable solution hearing whole city surrendered deciding kill anyway perhaps good people see daenerys stormborn made every effort avoid bloodshed ghost ride whip crazy brand stark bran probably biggest example wasted potential entire series becomes powerful entire world sit around make people feel bad personality stripped away could kind cool actually anything honestly thought going reach ultimate peak battle winterfell story completely tied white walkers purpose outside storyline even want get weird leave confident enough write weird creative use abilities creative ways guy see time space writers idea know randomly becoming king exactly wanted either expected something little bit nuanced nothing whole season getting chosen king feels kind anticlimactic remember ending desperately rushing get remember makes things seem kind lame fact whole last episode feels like really feel like finale really feels like desperately wanted get point feel earned feel right jon snow go fact writers reverted traditional fantasy tropes say jon snow hero story seasons much supported idea well honest think fine show drifted away george 's story jon kind hero 's journey stands around either making face face like everybody else reason half characters completely go brain-dead meet daenerys jon gets worst sex one time loses agency character probably mention right jon daenerys romance work probably noticed show suffers moving way quickly problem writers write ending characters start shifting around get might work movie slow-paced show like game thrones work john danny work second meet romantic tension second-to-last season characters never met meet fall love span episodes like giving goo-goo eyes first scene viewer immediately realize oh yeah events unfold around things depend romance basically violent love story television could kind cool story story john 's whole purpose last season oh new girlfriend kind dick takes passive role literal last episode know really wrinkles balls fact series nothing john 's previous back life hell need killing daenerys entire purpose whole series even worst worst john son rhaegar lyanna hits complete dead end story thing comes dany getting mad possibilities story thread endless writers absolutely nothing really confuses reason guys got job adapt books television show knew john 's parents actually even published books kind wiped hands clean napkin said think jon snow real mother test test absolutely test question predicted way back anything jon significance story stake events season anything end ship asked away forever jon 's entire purpose last seasons kill daenerys remember said writers wrote ending first believe cersei lannister cersei one favorite characters whole cirie 's turned lex subtlety character never really knew planning important goals always little justified thing series always prided characters strictly good evil characters good evil punished even cersei another character understand goes full batman villain bombs field hard thinking back always makes laugh lot people like scene yeah kind cool know really look back fondly one hand commend writers something batshit insane hand really fit character show matter started nuking cities medieval fantasy series kind started mentally check always character subtlety instead cold calculating cersei kind turns dumb evil bad guy also point really like characters die rubble falling top 2019 still dropping buildings characters like captain kirk know hate two kinds deaths media dying rubble falling dying falling pillar fire sandor clegane one 's kind short ask guy reason show anymore eventually show decided start bringing back characters fanservice decides join good guys keep fighting things character continues exist solely fans like never series operates character 's role story ends usually killed kicked yes cleganebowl meme watching game thrones final battle hound mountain indicative like series anymore used tightly written drama characters deep unseen motivations rich world history watching guy came back life fighting another guy came back life crumbling tower dragon goes sicko mode fight stupid feels like fight wolverine sabretooth x-men origins wait minute oh god damn wrote tyrion lannister used joke good old tyrone lancaster main character game thrones character relate witty teams daenerys gets dose dum dum juice whole plan two seasons reason cersei seasons 1 2 3 4 constantly talks reason reason thinks get tries like three perspective killed mom dad son ran away never listen understand think otherwise series making mistakes gets killed red wedding random tyrion made smart choice almost four seasons punished even fact gets rewarded even want die either wanted smarter much ask bringing dead people back life put women children crypt dead people smart smart greyjoy euron honestly funniest character whole show writers decided add another person story way late series even say ruined end series everything started stupid whenever scene never feel like belongs feels like guy wandered onto set another show honestly think writers realise ran bad guys killing bolton 's role simply extend greyjoy storyline little bit give jamie someone fight dies brienne tarth brienne fine actually think fine like jaime lannister one personal see jamie favorite character entire show much depth subtlety character early seasons first thing little boy window might immediately think okay villain quite case assessment completely intentional series wants think bad guy even whole universe kind treats like bad guy called kingslayer really nice way killing mad king story started kind seen slimy event history world killed mad king everybody would died anyway knew would really go hero knew right thing assassinated evil dictator since backhand manner everybody hates meant play initial perception character reputation see first act pushing little wee boy window immediately draw assumption actuality guy constantly puts harm 's way protect people things love line sum entire character fine putting ass fire protects somebody else dishonorable things honor loved ones selflessness self-destructive tears apart arguably one complex characters entire series character well goes journey self-discovery breaks heart go die abusive partner awesome one last things beats iran fight reason writers decided new arc learning fight losing sword hand supposed significant reasons problem seen hound well show character resolution seen combat fight scenes ways finish character arcs instead character actually learning something becoming different person end whole arc point shown us meant leave cersei forever supposed would life personally always thought destined kill common theory lot people intentionally breaks heart someone cares ceiling kills line last episode line solidify entire problem character every one million people city innocent otherwise honest never really cared much innocent otherwise telling man sacrificed honor murdering mad king effort save countless innocent people care people spendy commanded kill father guys even watch show sansa stark sansa okay started writing script around episode two really problem point like honestly strong independent woman even inconsistent first really bad moment hound like hey sorry bad stuff happening says okay like bad stuff happened badass really shows guys know write women one main female characters say yeah glad got tortured sexually assaulted jon goes says hey personal secret ned stark father took secret grave tell anyone spreading jon 's secret thing ahead defend actions far concerned fault arya stark finally least favorite character entire series kind sad used really like arya stands shining example like series become character rules apply watching main characters struggling fighting lives many people loved arya whenever complain hard argue points without looking like neckbeard really think super-powered version fits story end season 1 season 2 decides going badass going learn fight going kill people like character entire show makes decision world supports decision happens really like using term plot armor see get stabbed gut multiple times walk kind problem king 's landing completely destroyed arya person survives start see problem teleports place anybody strong manages sneak past zombies knight kings generals jumps ass shanks dies faster mountain could sent arya kill cersei reason believe arya would trouble sneak aria city let disguise maid something stab cersei guys batman payroll even care problem arias powerlevel accounts show aware strong act like completely normal creates disconnect hand though series takes nose dive shitsville kind like little mini story decides going anymore honest last two episodes think needed something latch literally every main character show ruined way another conflict lie antagonistic force much main heroes agreeing sansa mad daenerys like daenerys mad everybody sad everybody 's mad characters completely lose sense reason point people alive cunning resilience smart show forgot merry band dumb asses leading show seasons lot people look season seven bring show lost mojo adult swim even eulogy show climax episode good reason show really started going path could recover climax episode season 7 characters come dumbest plan ever heard good guys know dumb ice zombies coming kill everybody really soon convince evil lex luthor aid battle believe zombies genius plan go far north grab zombie bring back prove real plan outrageously stupid thought joke first kidding like characters bring fully expected someone say ridiculous let us come real plan one plan agree go along go north dangerous place could go grab zombie main characters safely escape get end show realize even really zombie anyway end story still fight cersei watch episode couple years ago realized show really lost marbles final season began little critical others episode 1 came kind slow nothing really happened everybody told hey man first episode give break battle winterfell happens people start seeing problems episode like dark hell see happening main characters somehow totally invincible die big evil dragon blew hole wall last season even prove threat anymore even melt rock jon snow hiding behind daenerys manages destroy entire city later season episode really anything zombies beat telling worked zombies mean give main characters decide done coming dumb plans episode battle winterfell characters decide plan defeat night king leave bran open lure night king literally never say plan happens hour half knew everything going fine anyway think might live holy series gets killed arya always thought night king going defeated something little less traditional people mad arya killed wanted jon snow really agree either night kings defeated normal person sword easy probably would dead long time ago personally wanted something creative happen thought bran going weird look face like knows going happen know expected something think night king even story narrative purpose serve tell one reason one thing contributed finale show remove white walkers entirely last season last two episodes change know things least little differently

unthinkable 2004 like phrase academy award winner matthew mcconaughey would said insane kasich jeb bush rick perry bobby jindal marco rubio said would attend gay wedding invited imagine terrible news gay acquaintances invited assumption declined attend send expensive gift instead well think would say yes mark friends wants sit bobby jindal yes friends like friends although candidates quite clear governor scott walker instance much squirrelly response would attend gay wedding well terms certainly first place family member taught family got family member reception wedding one marriages still defined man woman support constitution state someone love reception yes question hell respond rsvp card asked wanted chicken fish well certainly personal question dinner annette already chicken restaurant home last week believe fish recently though said still believe certainly meal position although according menu also maybe vegetarian option answer question eaten chicken past yes well well idea gay wedding increasingly widely accepted worth noting still number surprising ways ruin gay honeymoon today states lgbt person get married saturday posts photos wedding sunday get fired job thrown apartment monday okay clearly terrible possible reason fired job wedding theme stolen office supplies logical reason true discriminating gay people surprisingly legal much country fact 31 states people risk fired evicted refused service gay federal law may guarantee gay couple 's right get married offers exactly zero guarantees rights things normally follow like signing lease apartment afford conducting tense discussions finances brightly lit tapas restaurant choosing marching bank applying small business loan get brenda stupid cupcakes dogs idea ground brenda cupcakes cupcakes dogs eat brenda well cupcakes terrible terrible surprised worry alone 2013 poll showed nearly 70 people thought illegal federal law someone fired gay people believe feels like true optimistic wrong like thinking vertical stripes flattering making first condom purchase magnums optimistic statistically wrong plenty recent real-life examples discrimination happening look colin du barry kelly williams texas couple made mistake visiting restaurant called big al 's waitress something say said serve think bags serve waitress continued say big girls like men act like men ladies act like ladies nonchalantly like like almost like reading piece paper well phrase posted front door restaurant young lady know else say kept finally said said thought okay obviously appalling also someone might want tell big sign saying men act like men actually single gayest thing imaginable example recent discrimination regarding public accommodation discrimination workplace take case casey steagle gay man

scissor-tailed flycatcher oklahoma kidding go eastern phoebe bird pure winged majesty went chose piece garbage beak looks like fell miranda july 's hair barn oklahoma shame wrong side history anyway point states checkered history comes civil rights look arkansas right anti-discrimination ordinances earlier year actually passed anti anti-discrimination ordinance prevents city county extending civil rights protections gay people sponsor law explaining want treated equal like want someone lbgt community treated equal want fair want fair get rights get rights amil talking special rights creating lesbians sections airplanes putting signs six flags saying must gay go right basic equality positive moves federal level last month eeoc ruled civil rights act applies lgb workers year ago president added lgbt protections federal contractors great protections could undone successor worth noting two republican governors running president actually weakened state 's non-discrimination policies bobby jindal let executive order expire john kasich kept removed protections transgender workers reason must strange live state see progress actually move backwards would like apple suddenly introduced iphone 7 flip phone still dumb apple watch done dumb done main argument extending protections might infringe religious freedom forcing people act religious beliefs hence rise religious freedom restoration act around country religious freedom inherently bad thing saying current mega reverend lady perpetual exemption allow religious freedom limited sensible ways time muslims wear hijab driver 's license photo devout christians forced work sabbath reasonable limits heard mistakenly cited stories like colorado baker jack phillips estimates made 5,000 wedding cakes since opened

invincible whatever want know baker lost case colorado happens one states law banning discrimination based sexual orientation states laws even states religious freedom acts cases tend go gay people 's way good problem still way many states anti-discrimination laws maybe time fix nationwide one go interesting something called equality act congress right adds lgbt protections civil rights act fair housing act several others 200 co-sponsors house senate unfortunately precisely 0 republican genuinely difficult instance actual bill designated september 25th national lobster day even two republican co-sponsors look saying lobsters deserve recognition governments absolutely although point point point bill represents bare minimum discriminated represents threshold true gay tolerance whether would consider attending gay wedding actually reached every single presidential candidate parties asked would support passage federal law laws prohibit discrimination based sexual orientation gender

wrong high school general weird considering universal experience would think producers would know high school like could spend hours discussing plot holes like adults seem exist universe cliques incredibly well-defined jocks band band geeks yearbook… think high school experience anybody one thing could also talk silly nitpicks like jessica ’ dad air force nobody else ’ parents – live 200

delusions experiencing hallucinations seeing hearing something actually hallucinations come many different forms literally affect every sense good example tactile hallucination feel phone vibrate

gambling drug use sex clinical psychologist stay holiday inn express last night able diagnose bipolar disorder scene… hang mean never know… slang sex mom hope careful oh c ’ mon adult room would know happened later confirmed audience disorder in-patient mental health resort look sure bipolar mean feels like kind blurry line someone manic someone really good mood would also argue borderline personality disorder often co-morbid bipolar meaning occur time borderline personality disorder means ups downs much unstable sudden skye goes manic episode incredibly depressed episode matter minutes

attention intro psych class want get someone something two ways go reward punishment though psychology call reinforcement punishment two types positive negative positive negative mean good bad context means getting something taking something away positive reinforcement something understand getting something good reward positive punishment also something understand though name sounds bit contradictory getting punishment negative reinforcement something bad taken away maybe siren turns stand certain place headache goes away take medication behavior reinforced stopping bad thing happening negative punishment hand take away something good like grounded banned video game covered people self-harm positive reinforcement unfortunately big contributor someone feeling neglected self-harm suddenly showered care attention attention-seeking behavior vein munchausen syndrome person obviously needs medical attention mental health care also first place kind catch-22 positive punishment somewhat rare someone physically punish moral failing wrongdoing common people suffered abuse child longer parental figure dole punishment so… skye far tell fall category negative reinforcement seem fit bill taking away emotional pain feeling replacing physical pain soon feels depressive state coming goes home cuts stop want die people cut suicidal intent pain thus name unfortunately well half people self-harm eventually attempt suicide tell nothing worry nothing hannah commits suicide first episode self-harm show symptoms mental health issues two thirteen causes

hannah fight flight incomplete understanding available options actually fight flight freeze common response modern humans deer headlights know instead making decision nothing something hannah know running away harm screaming fighting back harm freezes – whether victim witness least response consistent across situations let us talk suicide possible done mean week healthy like move school right concerned knowing someone commits suicide increases likelihood friends family commit suicide 65 called suicide contagion happen local cluster even nationally someone like celebrity school reacting appropriately try get ahead copycat suicides exactly happens anyway alex attempts kill shooting head work reality works 97-99 time contrast hannah kills cutting her- whoa whoa showing scene crazy also disagree show showing pure shock value nothing anyway reality cutting wrists works 1.2-6 time flipped reason mention show various media depictions make look like takes seconds minutes reality takes

long stay within caloric needs course useless advice number 3 say increase intake fruits vegetables whole grains nonfat low-fat milk products well fruits veggies whole grains great milk much get back minute choose carbohydrates wisely next bit advice food pyramid could argue define wisely real advice cut sugar intake 185 pounds per person per year currently consume less pound year avoid flour products except treat stick whole food carbohydrates like vegetables fruits whole grains beans nuts seeds next bit advice choose prepare foods little salt bad advice food eat packaged processed foods actually prepare full salt like americans would meals outside homes helpful better recommendation would avoid packaged process prepared fast foods unless know exactly made next minim advice drink

ninety years old ketogenic diet loves skinny group sharp attack healthy horse know around friends dropping like flies said keeps telling eating wrong got problems give meds make even problems says taking nomads amazing yeah overmedication older generation quite shocking mean forget figures something uk 30 people 65 70 average six prescription medications everything gone crazy know go back atherosclerosis process interventions learned went enormous amounts research fairness deeper biochemistry looking trials trying guess associational rubbish studies stuff done would read study study got probably 300,000 out-of-pocket lab work testing see works wow well got discovering new data parroting people 's stuff conversation dr. bill blanchett day big cac scanning intervention stop progression couple unusual ones would probably like gorm infections gingivitis reflection bad diet give heart disease bacteria infections trigger immune system drive progression people otherwise done right things disappointed progressing maybe thoughts one instance oh give real interesting stuff veterans administration united states says going heart valve replaced teeth removed yeah hey buddy call glenn next-door neighbor said going oh yeah said know tooth infections screw valves going take teeth got kidding glenn really true know true bizarre way doctor blanchette made presentation cappella presentation clinic showed widowmaker audience introduced audience talked two hours two half hours pretty fun something interesting get vitamin c correct vitamin correct k correct magnesium correct guess brush teeth okay power compensate challenges bacteria immune reaction bacteria calls atherosclerosis mmm-hmm yeah turns brush yet meet mammal brushes teeth humans still looking find one yet looking ask brush teeth engineer know ask questions know license work know uh drilling turns get right brush teeth brushed teeth ten years went little mechanical opportunity dentist said proud year ago says oh god know people age really follow advice said floss brush everything looks great says brush teeth ten years says oh god plaque teeth yeah know supposed something well resonates yeah studies show hunter-gatherer tribes living real natural foods elements generally describe brush teeth average one cavity missing tooth think 50s skeleton studies done contrast similar genetic peoples move cities eat modern kind white man 's food want use phrase mid 50s myriad cavities missing teeth also even increase suicide rates tribes eat modern foods tooth pain bad without access dentistry suicides actually went tied dental problems mean kind blindingly obvious uh-huh see like engineers define problem define symptom define problem get different answers define symptom point native tribes study denmark denmark wanted denmark brought bunch folks inuit thule copenhagen brought would last three years died eventually inuit says going copenhagen killing us know danish government said well killing obviously something going studied diet found diet inuit made would survive western white man 's diet truly kill fascinating study one things get really published lot fascinating many examples like samoans amputations samoa diabetes obesity scale pima indians 50 full-blown type 2 diabetic moving new food supply probably diabetic measured postprandial insulin still get told shockingly laziness gluttony driving dietary problems right insane peoples world last century suddenly started getting loads heart disease increased cancers obesity diabetes humans different tribes around world suddenly got lazy got gluttonous absurd think yeah oh may want reference dr. noakes back 2002 published book lore running instance coach world-class athletes wow guru endurance running read book reads like chicago phone book 800 pages long biochemist fun oh god torture chapter 2002 2003 carbs got chapter read went oh god got everything right get right later doctor notes hats guy stud really intellectual stud said know book laura running remember youtube video ignore chapter carbs wrong apropos man giggles runs 50 mile races phenomenal shape following like said everything told became type 2 diabetic think amazing hey guys quick break remind podcast possible due funding irish heart disease awareness charity founder david bobbitt david discovered massive heart disease 2012 could getting five-minute calcification scan cac score enabled take action stop disease process save life spending millions help others likewise ask help get message power cac watch widowmaker movie linked end podcast share widely thank return conversation well discovered intellectual ethical ability admit wrong say must share save people lot lot researchers turn blind eye things uncomfortable doubt outrageous actually reminds calcium scan story widowmaker movie obviously enjoyed bill great work promote mean got scan enabled take action track progress fix heart disease reverses got gun forty years millions upon millions people got quick scan found would huge disease would like noakes realized duped low-fat high vegetable oil diet bit exercise completely let gave huge heart disease genetics would go search maybe profoundly would go search increasingly internet go digging angry huge disease going start finding heart disease works increasingly low carb root information exploding internet millions could saved yet system want use scan almost like want described happen think well reason wear tin hat listen radio two clock morning saturday night old saying follow money couple good good friends medical world tell reason encourage heart scans general practitioner confronted quickly john q public saying taking statin get scan every year heart disease increasing going problem trying gatekeepers controlling narrative issue heard good friend achieved chief surgeons prestigious hospital upper midwest retired said going week told scary give piece objective evidence live upper midwest heart scan center get heart scan 59 320 slice toshiba scanner excellent piece equipment recommended lot people go year allowed go every five years one friend said every five years said

ago son nearly died wife holiday france little baby boy called said 'he moving rushed lifeless thought choking picked tried clear airway nothing happened froze called said 'come got get hospital rushed worried got still moving doctors worried know happening night two lumbar punctures thought might meningitis stayed foreign hospital three days actually transpired son low level calcium blood

see disease disappeared health exists continuum okay top right got disease bottom left got optimal health always moving continuum take christmas new year example right drink much eat much stay late probably start move curve recalibrate january february start move back get involved medicine give diagnosis chronic disease ... things starting go wrong ... back see met dotti disease see think little bit like fire burning dotti 's body years getting bigger till finally raging control point say 'hey dotti disease told 'you disease caused first place thing understand acute disease chronic disease two different things acute disease something pretty good doctors good quite simple okay something like pneumonia severe lung infection lung overgrowth bugs typically bacteria identify bacteria give

trying find cure professor san francisco professor bredesen actually demonstrating cure dementia shown reverse cognitive decline patients dementia well one thing saying 'well patients office got dementia alzheimer 's disease cure going way saying patients let us say ten patients office trying work triggers last 20 years ended patient expressing dementia identifies corrects every single one guess happening reversing symptoms longer classified dementia brand new way looking disease looking causing disease individual patient totally different factors looking well looking diet looking stress levels sleep quality physical activity levels exposure environmental toxins et cetera et cetera et cetera starting sound little bit familiar see seemingly separate diseases actually core share common root causes see need update thinking genetics destiny genes load gun environment pulls trigger factors factors basically interact genes determine genes expressed whether optimal health whether disease whether somewhere collectively society genuinely believe better better type 2 diabetes alone costing us 20 billion pounds year 1 saving would 200 million pounds think way better 1 united

infant example child makes absolutely sense think everyday person street looks problem takes time read vaccine certain c 's heavy metals ingredients take pause realize make sense need clinical trial validation tell us know mother told us playing thermometer mercury careful know poured pour dougy stay body forever touch something going really obvious problem sort spell sort biomechanical illusion know need vaccines need chemicals improve immunity course god nature whatever metaphor use know terribly wrong know need vaccines save us even contain toxic metals know know poor around mercury long time said obviously toxic mean idea injecting straight system really kind bad idea simple logic said okay start taking mercury vaccines yo think still survives today yes recording yes fact multi dose flu vaccine contains mercury really big problem still obviously almost quasi mandated know six months older posting annual flu vaccine still exposure know believe acknowledgment powers marysol linked know expansion autism diagnosis decade ago started phasing officially announced reason clear time instead using mercury started use aluminum actually adjuvant well means stimulates even exaggerated immune response spoke shared production great volumes antibodies without antibodies affinities specific targets antigens trying neutralize good thing causes autoimmunity immune system freaking producing antibodies place tagging self structures mess really aluminum adjuvant heavy metal biological role play first still used may help explain took mercury decelerate know autism epidemic often justification oh well hello everyone took mercury autism still expanding well guess wrong mercury harmful infants children reason course aluminum experimental ant events much harm another example saying oh yes see took know trajectory data adverse effects really changed said substitute one poison another azen recent data showing aluminum yo causes related alzheimer 's absolutely aluminum powerful neurotoxin like mercury completely inhibit structure function neurons mystery would lead neurological injury regressive syndromes like autism clearly justification using actually financial motive use aluminum actually use less antigen needed produce vaccine save amount say flu antigen extremely expensive produce obviously profitable use aluminum even though harms clearly much likely occur well whole point aluminum know least one point aluminum say causes immune system race really whole thing injecting think normal biological process experience environment way types microbes germs come body know varying passageways body back bodily function coexisted microbes years right adapted based sitting saying going inject body genetic structure got reference point whole process right take viruses killed attenuated thrown body directly compared mouth nose things might normally come add mercury add aluminum body basically got freaked saying zero reference point exactly yes look perspective evolution speak know millions years history cocoa evolution right suddenly throw vector toxicants biological agents foreign substances directly body way unprecedented evidence-based respect elegant design body address fact immune system literally took millions millions years evolve get species point accredit survivability eons fact use vaccines concept without actually even measured clinical trial using surrogate endpoints evidence-based one topic ton interest know one holdings single article published gardasil circle doc 's calm one half million people read talk gardasil know implications whole vaccine arena well problem gardasil vaccine many actually one types hpv antigens include cover natural range humans exposed mean words one type going really meet reality exactly dozens different variations hpv ones characterized actually probably many orders magnitude fact ones originally included gardasil vaccine cover type known problems african-american community even sort color blindness could considered unethical problem course though even industry funded research like glaxosmithkline funded clinical trial revealed hpv infection naturally occurs commonly transferred mother infant passively necessarily transmitted sexually naturally occurring protective effect cervical cancer opposite saying though could barely believe like alternative health research group funding found kay would like okay yeah right glaxosmithkline research course go deep rabbit hole realize fda approved hpv vaccines without requiring clinical trial validation start realizing never single study proving single case cervical cancer prevented hpv vaccine furthermore research natural history hpv infection dysplasia know lesions causes time almost invariably case go remission quote tumor formed self-limiting cycle immune system figuring suppressing create creating healthy tissue lifelong immunity theoretically produced notion need vaccine way original hpv vaccine expensive vaccine ever produced think like 300 full courses per person money behind driving intellectual justification really exist account role natural infections play fact self-limiting inevitably lead cervical cancer anal cancer related mortality statistics drawn void form propaganda stretch also deductively basically saying well hpv virus human papilloma virus causes certain forms cervical cancer therefore inoculate virus going cure cancer mean like wild stretch know young somebody develop diagnostic technology go fda evidence proof claims made important thing fda big criteria going make certain claims got really pretty substantive evidence claim making us looked said saying cancer vaccine cervical cancer like steps along way leaps faith said believe approving intended use exactly well use proxy markers efficacy like increase antibody titers things order way statistics manipulated example vaccinate thousand people trial instead two people diagnosed precancerous lesion one person diagnosed well say 50 reduction know save fifty percent transferred absolute risk reduction insignificant relative risk sounds like saved half people trial doctor comes says child adolescent could get anal cancer cervical cancer penile cancer die 50 higher chance happening take vaccine translating public completely manipulative intentionally know disingenuous thing could done know vaccine around long still newer marketplace compared several others know exactly said know feel mothers parents daughter know point going become sexually active know bad parent inject consequences could substitutive absolutely know hpv vaccine highest adverse events reports vaccine yet released vaccine released gardasil vaccine highest incidence reported incidence adverse events right death picked passive surveillance system even though huge number still fraction actually happening far adverse events actually one new genetically modified vaccines taking yeast genetically altering express hpv proteins unfortunately yeast big problem called biologists men mammal genome yeast similar mammals humans 33 proteins produced yeast overlap human proteins actually called molecular mimicry injecting vaccine hoping body produces antibodies hpv sequences instead body producing potentially antibodies every sequence within yeast cells proteins antibodies produced body idea self immune system starts devouring body believe problem vast although acute events ones looking sub acute subclinical chronic know immune disorder related effects probably know fast well talking autoimmune disorders know body 's properly recognizing starts problems debilitating chronic nature like said like acute response know immediate affect like know could put obvious thing like subtle thing time feeling quite right imagine young adolescent girl suddenly tired would say almost energy shifts lower level function quite engage ways used probably engage academic probably engage athletically etc oppressive effect immune system know know basically disrupted almost referal way yes know think lot versus effects gardasil reported opinion underreported even though lot report yes even immediate response yes chronic problems 10 years later 15 years later real issues playing back gardasil vaccine know could ever traced huge experiment exactly know fda identified vaccines unavoidably unsafe know know allowing injected children going real likelihood adverse events many trackable violation basic principle know bodies able know obtain wellness clean air water sunshine

well-baby visit feel like going better vaccine compliance pop infant rather trying coax adolescent families come physician put aluminum mean need aluminum vaccines purpose saying vaccine advocate advocate put aluminum purpose aluminum formulation vaccines basically stimulates nonspecific immune response okay add called adjuvant add adjuvant vaccines drastically magnifies immune response antigen hpv virus particle vaccine drastically increases response basically tricks immune system thinking bigger problem actually problem trick immune system get prolonged immune response get immune response improper human body gardasil quadrivalent gardasil four different types human papilloma 9-valent vaccine nine different types completely unnatural way human immune system responds nature

autoimmunity men women getting vaccine well adjuvant mean reduce amount antigen saves money adjuvant literally another adjuvant used vaccines called squalene term squalene inside cdc hamburger helper

good thing asked please watch video open mind check sources included description lot try objective without ado support vaccines pretty simple vaccines prevent lot disease save lot lives instance smallpox caused terrible lesions scarring extreme cases blindness death eradicated thanks smallpox vaccine polio causes paralysis rare cases eradicated world thanks polio vaccine measles kills one two every 1 000 people contract used incredibly common used infect hundreds thousands children every single year you.s see less 200 cases year thanks mmr vaccine well hopefully year 200. see later mumps painful infection result hearing loss death rare cases used also common childhood disease 186 000 cases per year you.s thanks vaccines see 200 2 000 cases per year course forget furry friends rinderpest cattle plague used kill basically buffalo antelope deer etc contracted eradicated 2011 thanks plowrite vaccine list goes point vaccines pretty spectacular track record would love end video make things lot easier course know lot supposed problems fact vaccines toxic dangerous kill people autism least linked autism let us look let us get one way first mmr vaccine vaccine matter autism number one study studies showed link correlation increasing rates autism vaccines imply causation number two even correlation autism vaccines exist 2014 meta-analysis 10 studies included 1.2 million children found relationship autism mmr vaccine infamous andrew wakefield study included know one 12 kids supposedly showed link autism mmr vaccine turns medical histories 12 children misrepresented even altered also serious problems regarding conflicts interests result paper later retracted 10 wakefield 's 12 co-authors wakefield also lost license practice uk brian hooker 's reanalysis cdc data found 340 increase autism rates amongst african-american boys vaccinated one included either one also retracted conflicts interest well concerns regarding validity methods used really surprising considering brian hooker statistician vocal anti-vaccine stance pretty clear hooker 's whole point prove point show link autism vaccines science mmr vaccine autism nobody knows sure compelling theories regards increased rates autism instance recent 2015 study danish children born 1980 91 700 000 children found changes reporting practices account 60 increase autism prevalence words majority rise autism actually autism increased diagnosis autism increased previous studies similar findings another study one 2014 found correlation air pollution autism women exposed greater amounts particulate matter pregnancy found greater chance autistic child studies similar findings whatever increased rates autism whether diagnosis air pollution something else entirely clear vaccines nothing autism science foundation poignantly writes asked autism vaccine question two dozen times time get response relationship need move last 10 years zero deaths measles 100 deaths mmr vaccine first claim zero deaths measles last 10 years false least four people died 2009 2010 measles look rest world looking close 150 000 deaths mostly children 2013 alone second rest claim 100 deaths mmr vaccine incredibly deceptive claim found searching vaccine adverse event reporting system problem database show effect relationship getting vaccine adverse effect intend explicitly stated website varus collects data adverse event following vaccination coincidental truly caused vaccine third importantly reason deaths zero close zero deaths you.s measles last 10 years measles vaccine mmr vaccine mentioned earlier infection incredibly common united states vaccine introduced 1960s since kids kids you.s get mmr vaccine less kids get measles less kids die measles pretty simple say vaccine complications exist usually minor like low-grade fever soreness injection site severe adverse effects happen instance mmr vaccine deafness even permanent brain damage often happen less 1 1 million doses certainly trying trivialize make light way serious sad anything life weigh pros cons take driving instance driving riding car dangerous activity much likely die car crash getting vaccine fact 2011 650 children ages 12 years younger died car crashes 148 000 injured yet many us drive drive loved ones drive teeny tiny little newborn babies car decided benefits driving motor vehicle outweighs risks injury death decision vaccinate different decision drive car except case vaccines actually much stronger case driving car likely die car crash die even severe reaction vaccine fact far children would seriously injured even die without vaccines according misleading graphs like right vaccines save us cases polio measles typhoid fever whooping cough etc declining well vaccines ever entered

last december 2014 disneyland california spread six states 125 infected far many vaccinated notice say people unvaccinated vaccinated measles still got measles happen happens vaccine 100 effective effective 100 unfortunately infections still happen kind like condoms 100 effective babies still happen seriously though fact people elicit proper response vaccinations great reason us get vaccinated large number people community vaccinated helps protect people get vaccinated people get vaccinated still immune helps protect people contracting disease called herd immunity means people vaccinated less likely susceptible person come contact infected person vaccines contain sorts scary things really know sound scary make us really sick sure things vaccines make us sick high amounts important thing remember dose makes poison things dangerous super high amounts virtually anything including water used small safe amounts vaccines perfectly safe okay maybe one vaccine fine current vaccine schedule kids getting injected multiple times one session overload little tiny baby 's immune system nope studies shown multiple vaccinations weaken immune system although seems like kids injected stuff vaccines given opposite actually true 14 vaccines given today contain less 200 bacterial viral proteins versus 3 000 seven vaccines administered 1980. vaccines tested actually vaccines tested rigorously process takes 10 15 years complete corporate greed corporate greed resulted continues result less disease lives saved evil find interesting many people concerned companies like merck making

thomas know page like know feeding kid cod liver oil ideal prenatal vitamin know even things know like cannabinoids breast milk lotus birthing mentioned wanted talk lot stuff came back said things specifically want bring want talk show mentioned main things wanted conversation childhood illnesses went nation children almost chronic diseases nation children chronic disease kind norm also want touch things like vaccinations hanan biotics tylenol common things use kids also controversial statement made play kids think three definite areas going book completely board diving although warn proceed risk even mentioning word vaccinations podcast talk um anyways though would like kick game man idea kids getting sick days actually make statement chapter 13 book kids balance get sick exposed germs kids balance get sick exposed germs pretty bold statement go mean like mean kid balance yeah may qualify actually go um think order understand um look history childhood sickness last say fifty hundred years would absolutely encourage anybody listening anybody 30 ask parents grandparents still anybody sixty think know talking people middle yeah uh instance grade school far know one child school chronic disease asthma remember class made fun sick necessarily proud fact made fun hopefully make fun point unusual child know going school inhaler sick time know something took note one one kids would said back day weak constitution right yeah right weird picked know went situation instance things like know hardly anybody anybody food allergies eczema chronic asthma leukemia starting read autism unheard-of nobody thought autism know learning problems etc usual retort hear conventional doctors pediatricians always kind amuses well know diagnose yeah hear like like celiac disease gluten intolerance like rise people say make wheat differently people say oh wheats diagnose stuff prevalently name back day right may small component tell somebody comes office says hey doc see rash losing arms say oh looks like eczema take rocket scientist somebody says wheezing breathe know every four weeks underdiagnosis fact anything doctors savvy er diagnosis based exams history rely tests actually reject idea know notice somebody autistic back 1930 hmm hard say something really wrong okay awesome go situation recently heard statistic 40 children detroit public schools carry inhaler school detroit know kind desperate situation maybe worst extensive documentation crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis asthma eczema certainly autism learning problems peanut allergies food allergies sleep disorders name astronomical rise asked 50 years yep mean anybody know actually simply paying attention studies facts course think think anybody 's going deny like kids get sick nowadays even talked show dr. cowan stuff like know hygiene hypothesis right like bottle boiling c-sections avoiding exposing kids germs using antibacterial hand soaps created kids maybe immune systems quite strong like horse kicked death certainly something brought think lot listeners kind sort aware familiar right lot reasons reasons absolutely valid true bigger reason okay bigger reason way get chronic disease mistreatment acute disease probably said example site clearest example give somebody gets splinter finger take get post medical school went trained conventional doctor learned poss means infection means bad means kill person would presumably give antibiotic get rid pus problem splinter would stay would go cycle antibiotic get rid poss pus would come back get rid etc etc end chronic situation scarred nasty finger people would say well stupid example everybody right mind would let post get splinter right thing happens know doctors offices hundreds thousands times variations like persons put smoke lungs like putting splinters lungs get cough role cough clear debris period doctor know easy either thought somehow convinced works get rid cough leave splinters lungs right set keep essentially iatrogenic meaning doctor disease failure allow get rid things irritating body okay ennis go ahead saying case doctor allow cough continue progress way would want like let us say like fever continue progress child help clean go whatever underlying causing coughs case like smoking case child know getting fever much know would maybe let speak ultimately basically less saying like go source issue rather symptom right job doctor traditionally natural medicines fact medicines current western conventional medicine seen role doctor essentially squiring helping children people know overcome acute disease helping use know whatever herbs compresses teas warm baths whatever help fever cough job meant okay job doctor art medicine doctors instead suppress illness good example relates whole etiology much asthma medical school clinic 10 year old boy know inhaled steroids oral steroids bronchodilators time one day comes hospital hundred four fever actually x-ray white one part lung full-blown pneumonia went examine supposedly patient first time wheezing already knew knew natural medicine went medical school asked head pediatrician bacterial pneumonia seems cured asthma said hey know reports literature pneumonia cures people asthma cured pneumonia gave back asthma medicine fully understand possible pneumonia could killed would horrible outcome second part first job doctor assess child really childhood illness children get sick quote said said sure balance children get sick let change little bit encounter things burn quickly usually within day left better started healthy children get sick created situation every time cleaning process clearing process process strengthens immune system happens doctors give tylenol suppresses fever shown increase incidence chronic disease yeah tylenol causes liver failure right trial causes liver felicia 's toxic liver aware however though need shut fever mean get certain point human body supposed like hot period time lead things like dehydration cellular death like like control fever somehow well answer mostly evidence fevers harm second job doctor know gotten much stop way necessary mean fevers mean fever dehydrate mean would mean looking like ancestral standpoint right would ancestors given somebody fever like water bone broth salts electrolytes things nature yeah right right exactly part doctors parents ever prevent dehydration help know expectorate whatever needs expectorated know support process exactly get dehydrated excessive cellular damage point properly risk event turning bad mean 35 years basically never seen turn bad yeah okay saying makes sense actually want like dive gritty tactics outline chapter know give lot really great natural ways things like treat colds fever congestion favorite things like use kids like hung weston price conference georgia year granddaughter lap name amia amia yes mia yeah let us let us say know talked balance imbalance kid imbalance kid going lot susceptible either sicknesses taking long time run course know taking kid first place go balanced kid would would look like mean talking ensuring child imbalance know case someone like mia like advice would giving like son wife know far like could help amia become balanced anybody else listening actually create balanced child reason ask think kind relevant something talked talked vegetables right whole like concept threefold man kind kind equate person vegetable take care person 's know vegetable like shape accordingly kind like like bring together talk would actually child yeah mean pretty simple get point acute disease people worry deal children words children get sick question keep child getting sick um mean big picture put splinters means put toxic stuff expose toxic stuff going need use mechanism get sick see sickness therapy point instance inject aluminum flush somehow flush call sick words want sick inject aluminum aluminum flush sick way sitting inject aluminum talking vaccinations yeah okay first feed know food really food know people call non-food edible stuff also always creates certain toxicity bodies children good try eliminate elimination process call sick body 's cell mediated reaction getting fundamentally elimination detoxification reaction okay know strategy sick children talking introducing toxins kid makes sense mean like know like kid mentioned like would made fun back day asthma saying kid like eating lunchables getting injected aluminum got sick reason kids getting sick days seems like mean even advent know fake processed foods vaccinations kids getting sick kids get sick um large sick sick process basically method exercising cell mediated immune system instance know instance sick talking measles going along perfectly fine healthy child contact measles virus quotes thick clothes find sick fever cough rash headaches feel well two weeks things measles know growth process measles confers certain lifelong immunity instance know studies children go kind sickness less heart disease less autoimmune disease less neurological problems less learning problems less leukemia children go process sense children get sick exercise end robust immune system sort like decided never going run sudden run raced san francisco would work intelligent brilliant guy work suck right train little bit exercise muscles sick child got sick know twice year characteristic illnesses sense left robust got sickness even ways mean course sick inconvenient even want belittle fact extremely rare case process could go wrong something bad could happen job doctor essentially assure child anybody acute fay 's like word common language child better done actually better started okay got like better train saying makes sense ask practical ways manage things help kid get better one last things wanted ask like term throw around part know kids getting sick treating kids medical term called sclerosis seen mention much books bring sclerosis relevant discussion sclerosis means essentially tissues getting harder one hallmarks chronic disease instance pathology study lungs asthmatic person find becomes crystals called charcoal laden crystals kersh mons spirals tissue becoming hard stiff brittle body like child talked body dissolves warmth pus strategy emphasize enough strategy body access tissues becoming hard stiff crystalline dysfunctional think cancers think hardening arteries think plaque development brain yeah recourse body activating cell mediated inflammatory response much inflammation country inflammation therapy ah reason chronic inflammation much sclerosis people relegated speak spending rest life trying dissolve got excessively take anti-inflammatories like trying burn bunch wet logs yeah think lot people feel good start know sounds like dumb solution like drink really good water really good water mean like clean clear structured water water like minerals added know lot people like making glass bottled water setting sun gets charged infrared light mean something simple water talk many diseases related sclerotic hardening dehydrating type processes mean run people literally changed things like fibromyalgia calcification chronic fatigue switching type water drink drinking water sounds dumb actually works many situations right point get big picture literally thousands different strategies use accomplish drink good water take cold showers exercise sweat drink eat worming foods like ginger tumeric hot soup broth answer earlier question healthy children things get exposed lots soil microbes playing dirt things come naturally get big picture using warmth heat heat microbes create cell mediated reaction keeps body getting hard soon sclerotic brittle sick soon yeah healthy child book chock-full natural remedies many really go obviously people read book use like yeah yeah know almost like manual like kid gets fever things kid gets cold things congestion things little things image book think bring like talking inflammatory process talking fevers uh fan example vitamin fan vitamin uh good question know keep going back theme job doctor understand child gets sick instance measles job catastrophe growth opportunity job help child get end better shape better job right around time measles um immunization basically thwarted whole process therefore contributes chronic disease uh interesting article carry office called measles learned nothing yet published american academy pediatrics bible pediatrici

0,"hi guys name sanjay gupta consultant cardiologist york today wanted video subject magnesium magnesium good us yet little really think part reason much illness moment something magnesium deficiency want talk okay certainly changed practice big way pretty well much everyone know takes magnesium uncommon get least one two people every day come say look magnesium recommended really good made real difference life perhaps one days put videos people taken magnesium found helped big way know regards ectopic heartbeats talk lot ectopic heartbeats videos generally people felt well b people felt well people slept better etc going talk magnesium good making good heart first thing say ultimately majority problems arise regards health based around something called inflammation body starts reacting external influences reacting number years causes long-term changes within body ultimately result harder heart get blood around body okay big problem long term inflammation get development hardening arteries blood get needs easily time progresses blood gets less easily less easily eventually areas heart areas brain areas body start lacking blood getting persistent hardening people develop high blood pressure heart work much harder generate higher pressure try get blood vital organs anything improves blood supply anything reduces inflammation good thing anything improves blood supply vital organs good thing okay anything pins blood ever says slightly try allow stops blood thickening get easily good thing magnesium properties let talk little bit magnesium magnesium mineral electrolyte fourth abundant mineral body necessary electrical activity heart brain also cofactor 300 reactions within body recommended daily allowance four hundred four hundred twenty milligrams men three hundred ten 360 milligrams women actually daily intake lot less whereas supposed taking four hundred milligrams majority people take two hundred forty three hundred seventy milligrams okay 75 people take less magnesium also worth understanding happens magnesium take 30 40 percent absorbed within gut small bowel excreted kidneys kidneys reabsorb magnesium interesting one two percent available blood sixty-seven percent bone thirty-one percent around cells within body measure blood measuring tiny proportion actually around magnesium deficient majority us magnesium deficient reason firstly taking enough reason modern farming methods deplete magnesium soil processing food depletes magnesium taking magnesium food lot less done food grown b processed becomes magnesium deficient anyway take magnesium actually absorb stomachs well reason absorb well lot us pee pee lumps oprah 's omeprazole tablets people take indigestion reflux reflux bad food fed people taking agents agents inhibit production gastric acids inhibit production acid stomachs actually acid really necessary know born acid stomachs digest things block absorption block secretion acid going absorb less absorbing getting less magnesium going taking proton pump inhibitors well proven reduce amount magnesium within body absorbing much magnesium similarly also carbonated beverages also reduce amount absorption magnesium body number two whatever absorbing whatever getting inside us using gup much using lot magnesium nowadays several hundred years ago stress uses magnesium stressed lack sleep uses magnesium get little sleep sugar intake taking sugar uses lot magnesium needs magnesium break process got much sugar going foods breaking magnesium getting keep magnesium within bodies also excreting larger amount magnesium things like coffee tea lot us diuretics means know said kidneys excreted reabsorb well taking things diuretics make cost water reduces absorption magnesium hit many different angles terms lack magnesium terms magnesium depleted surprising deficient magnesium next word deficient think pretty well much us magnesium deficient well anything dramatic look carefully know lot us tired magnesium deficiency tiredness lot us see particularly well magnesium deficiency insomnia lot us feel anxious get depressed magnesium deficiency associated many people complain heartache heart fluttering palpitations magnesium deficiency certainly people develop hardening arteries develop high blood pressure said heart heart know inflammatory reaction constantly going bodies stress bad food etc causes hardening arteries magnesium anti-inflammatory role therefore short magnesium get inflammation get hardening arteries get high blood pressure good magnesium intake helps things also diabetes taking magnesium better diabetic control causes osteoporosis deficient magnesium lot people get constipation bowel disturbance deficient magnesium may immediately obvious look number years find actually things crept without actually realizing actually sleep well high marks always tired days could something easy fact devoid getting much magnesium last twenty years worth bearing mind next thing measure well blood test pretty well much useless told earlier really measuring one two percent know total magnesium count would rely blood test time may useful deficient blood test confirms blood test shows magnesium levels okay mean better way measure magnesium measure content magnesium blood cells measuring intracellular content measuring much magnesium excreting urine urinary magnesium levels red cell magnesium content measured easy tests get easily available people say oh well magnesium levels fine blood test effects would rely blood test making next question says well people recommend magnesium know much owners told reason case one difficult measure much big research done one really profits people interested big research new wonderful expensive drugs know research driven pharma companies therefore simple things like one really looks go onto internet look pubmed find tons small studies shown know benefits magnesium small anticoagulant effect anti-inflammatory effect also vasodilator opens blood vessels allowing blood get vital organs ie reducing pressure heart really good get okay think first thing say important responsible eating know try get better

0,studying human mind tricky business still much know many questions scientists looking answer researchers working human subjects balance getting answers protecting subjects past always good taking care fellow human beings studying lot historical psychology experiments would considered unethical today ’ standards foundation ethical standards use today comes 1970s scientists came list rules protect security privacy human volunteers known belmont report basically three key ethical principles guide human research first point called respect persons means subjects give informed consent anyone participates human research — including psychological research — needs know risks benefits experiment signing second ethical principle called beneficence basically means researchers try negative impact wellbeing people participate studies basically “ harm ” final point justice involves making sure subjects exploited researchers also make sure burdens study benefits results distributed fairly early research studies example subjects would often poor wealthier patients would benefit results experiment okay rules apply human research fields including psychology code conduct always clearly defined lot questionable studies done year 1920 psychologist named john watson wanted show humans classically conditioned — like happened pavlov ’ dogs basically classical conditioning means pairing stimulus like food triggers physical response like drooling unrelated stimulus like bell even though ringing bell course would normally make dogs drool pavlov paired sound food conditioned dogs respond bell drooling watson team decided prove could done humans classically conditioning 9 month old baby named albert using animals scary noises first researchers presented albert fuzzy white rat would reach pet animal psychologists would strike hammer metal bar behind head creating loud noise startle eventually sight white rat enough make albert start crying crawl away would began associate fear loud scary noise fuzzy white rat yeah albert conditioned study failed lot ways one thing used single subject controls watson really proved anything course ethical issues watson never reconditioned albert afraid anymore permanently affected experiment good way also know albert ’ mother fully consented research definitely violates main ethical principles belmont report horrifying psychology experiment conducted children early 20th century late 1930s psychologist named wendell johnson graduate student mary tudor university iowa wanted know positive negative feedback affected way children learned language decided test directly giving kids positive negative feedback speech disorders might sound bad reason experiment known monster study tudor recruited 22 children orphanage told would given speech therapy split two groups ten children — five group — early signs stutters groups also included kids normal speech patterns kids one group told stutter given positive feedback would outgrow speech difficulties ignore anyone criticized way spoke meanwhile group told stutter never speak unless could right probably imagine go well encouragement criticism seem much effect children ’ stutters different kinds feedback huge impact self-esteem kids speech issues got positive feedback lose stutters become lot confident spoke meanwhile children given negative feedback became withdrawn self-conscious frustrated — whether actually stutter begin group kids research pretty damaging minors could consent research people ran orphanage protect potential harm study children also debriefed project real follow may affected study long-term things later declared unethical belmont report experiments course harm adult subjects 1961 researcher yale university named stanley milgram interested psychology obedience decided see subjects would react researcher pushed things went morals study came called milgram experiment three separate roles experimenter played scientist white lab coat authority figure teacher role assigned experimental subject final role learner paid actor subject thought actually another volunteer learner sent separate room sight experimenter observed teacher subject instructing learner word-pairing task intercom every time learner got word pair wrong teacher pressed button shock voltage increasing 15 volts every wrong answer subject believed shocking learner actually listening actor pretending pain complaining chest pains shouting pounding wall eventually going silent experiment ended teacher given maximum 450 volt shock three times row refused continue 65 subjects give maximum voltage shocks — scientist white lab coat told milgram concluded people obey authority figures even morally questionable circumstances experiment since led many studies psychology authority subjects thought actually listening someone electrocuted end line even though told experimenter would quote “ permanent tissue damage ” leaving subjects feeling like may killed someone protect wellbeing could gotten informed consent since warning participants experiment would changed reacted since studies led people believe might hearing someone get seriously injured 1964 woman named kitty genovese murdered time newspapers reported 30 witnesses murder none called police know reports flawed seemed like dozens people stood someone murdered right front 1968 psychologists john darley bibb latané columbia university came way learn people might act crisis especially others around placed college student volunteers alone rooms gave headphones told study emotional issues faced students subject told would communicating students intercom avoid privacy issues might come face-to-face students line actually recordings — one recorded students mentioned early conversation occasional seizures later experiment voice would start trouble speaking ask help saying seizure researchers measured long took subjects go look help found took participants longer respond people conversation subject less likely something believed people could intervene instead called bystander effect understanding response important investigating crimes protecting communities teaching people act crisis instead assuming someone else like milgram experiment ethical concerns research might affected subjects study days would tough convince review board potential benefits kind study outweigh risks another study turned damaging ended early 1971 philip zimbardo psychology professor stanford university wanted learn placed different social roles affected way people behaved decided simulate prison cast volunteer subjects roles guards prisoners 24 white male college students recruited study separated two groups prisoners prison guards zimbardo acted prison superintendent prisoners searched given id numbers instead names dehumanize meanwhile prison guards given uniforms clubs told whatever maintain order giving power prisoners — sense superiority study supposed last 2 weeks actually called 6 days conditions prison went downhill quickly one prisoner released study even earlier conditions jail made panicked disoriented prisoners started revolt guards treated badly guards became abusive giving prisoners physical punishments misbehaved like forcing sleep concrete strip naked end zimbardo concluded subjects internalized assigned roles prisoners became submissive guards became aggressive abused power prisoners could study today acting superintendent impossible zimbardo stay impartial pretty big flaw study ’ design — invested outcome research zimbardo also allowed guards subject prisoners serious abuse may caused real permanent harm whole wellbeing thing really taken consideration study like rest studies list stanford prison experiment would considered ethical days psychology ’ sometimes-dark past helped scientists realize responsibility protect public subjects research studies — ethical standards important part modern research want understand human mind process also protect minds studied standards laid belmont report help us thanks watching episode scishow brought patrons patreon want help support show go

parenthood talked importance choice third thing thing paying extra pepperoni like normal person finally notion pizza shops better pizza becomes effectively undercut two words papa john 's ohio 's charters huge problems lack oversight review one year 's state audits found charters misspent public money nearly four times often form taxpayer-funded agency cases incredible like lisa ham school

0,going talk little bit vaccines today actually work viruses stanford day went little video game conference night playing game called ai anybody know name game oh yeah unfortunately one characters actually speaker gave presentation katie got measles thought funny thinking guys today problem people get measles today back oregon trail 1848 one problems characters encountered dealing vaccinating diseases 200 years first vaccine developed edward jenner smallpox dr. jenner trying figure people got smallpox people noticed particularly milkmaids get smallpox looked little bit noticed always exposed cows cows getting disease called cow pox milkmaids exposed similar virus cow pox able immunized smallpox virus getting one types viruses immune system recognized kind thing bad protected smallpox vaccines developed within lifetime know remember getting chickenpox kid gotten chickenpox anybody get chickenpox vaccine yeah remember young older sister got chickenpox little sister 's got vaccine never got chickenpox never get chickenpox body knows looks like able fight similarly little sisters get chickenpox either got vaccine bodies know fight prevent get lot vaccines children also get boosters diseases adults talking diseases talk measles smallpox rabies yellow fever know diseases look like seen victims diseases actually going talk pathogens diseases little tiny microbes infect cells body get diseases different ways protect rather combat diseases similarly antibiotics antivirals another form defense bodies even encounter viruses bacteria prevent us ever getting diseases first place vaccinations different types vaccines one live attenuated vaccine scientists take virus bacteria actually change genetic material virus bacteria easier viruses much fewer genes bacteria actually live virus made harmful body disadvantages live attenuated vaccines small chance usually chance might revert pathogenic virus also bad immunocompromised patients get kind vaccines also need refrigerated different countries might access refrigeration harder time get inactivated vaccine scientist actually kill let say quotes kill pathogen either heating exposing chemicals different radiation lot safer live attenuated vaccines however strong usually people need get boosters viruses use inactivated vaccines subunit vaccines part virus bacteria actually pathogenic usually outside virus bacteria scientists take antigens actually use vaccine presenting antigen body elicit immune defense also toxoid vaccines lot times bacteria disease toxins release scientists take toxins kind toxify adding formalin also conjugate vaccines present often bacteria surrounded polysaccharides young immune systems like infant immune systems recognize polysaccharides problem scientists attach polysaccharide known antigen use vaccine adjuvants important vaccines adjuvant usually aluminum salts added vaccine trigger danger person bloodstream adjuvant present along smaller amount actual vaccine allow immune system know needs make large response antigen vaccines work vaccine entered bloodstream recognized antigen presenting cell antigen presenting cell apc takes antigen breaks little pieces presents outside cell kind shows cells nearby goes places body like lymph nodes actually beat cells cells accumulate cells recognize antigens presented alert cells b cells something bad body b cells recognize either apc cell antigens bloodstream start kind producing antibodies lot b cells become plasma b cells produce lot antibodies antibodies specific antigen bind either targeting degradation allowing bind cells cells become active live attenuated virus actually infected cell cell become killer cell kill cell infected important b cells cells responded vaccine become memory b cells cells actual pathogen present memory b cells cells already available ready combat virus bacteria instead one soldier present combat invader entire army present combat invaders caveats vaccine development first high mutation rate pathogens bodies dna dependent rna polymerase replicate lot precise polymerase go back change mistakes made makes going many viruses rna genome example influenza virus rna genome ability go back fix errors makes error-prone another problem pathogens known immunity hiv example cases patient developing immunity hiv since example people get immune chicken pox ones chicken pox never going get know sort immunity builds patient however without immunity hiv example anyway happened really know exactly make virus mimic immunity simple infographic shows far come 200 years since vaccine development illnesses completely eradicated like smallpox 70 still long way go new techniques developed one actual dna based vaccine presents dna nucleic acid bloodstream one virus vector vaccine allows dna pathogen put virus bacteria already immunity harmful virus bacteria delivery techniques think least one two different viruses think use nasal spray like influenza also patch technique developed instead needle arm get patch many little needles delivers vaccine good different countries one last thing going leave important vaccines individual individual community get teeth checked want cavities community get vaccines protect everyone protect little niece born protect grandfather might amine compromised system unvaccinated group introduce pathogen everybody gets infected many people vaccinated introduce pathogen many vaccinated people protect even unvaccinated people people vaccinated people actually protected vaccine summary come long way vaccine development even scientists currently working many new types vaccines new vaccine development community help help scientists help world eradicate diseases going leave suggestion get yearly influenza vaccination

know secret created video help friends help guys mindvalley channel understand could improve eyesight basically able go wearing glasses 40 time 4 time issue eyesight started 9 years old started wearing glasses eyesight rapidly deteriorated point myopia shortsightedness -7.00 basically means could recognize face close around 28 finally lasik lasik restored 20/20 eyesight know go surgery sometimes things go wrong happened lasik surgery basically went awry left eye left astigmatism next 12 years left eye started getting worse worse right eye decided deteriorate catch left eye 12 years lasik found needed glasses go back doctor figure doctor told man 40s lasik would longer option faced two choices deal wearing glasses totally disliked try heal eyesight happened conversation friend dave asprey famous biohacker founder bulletproof coffee dave told working vision coach one hour week 12 weeks totally got rid bad eyesight allowed function without glasses intrigued started researching natural healing eyesight going share found going share advice help restore eyesight get rid glasses reduce amount time wear glasses still experimenting year although perfect yet want share know believe going help lot people video going cover number different things looking prevent bad eyesight developing kids looking heal vision looking prevent onset age-related vision problems like farsightedness looking reduce use glasses pay attention going share everything learned first big mistake people make go get eyes checked store sells glasses never good idea machines store accurate simple experiment eyes checked one stores went real clinic real doctor difference almost 40 decided take doctor 's prescription see eyesight varies day day year year studies children found child could naturally move shortsightedness farsightedness year year happens picked particular slice time eyesight say 0.25 go optician get glasses locks glasses become crutch want go real doctor true vision checkup could take hour eyeglass shop right around 15 minutes want move sell glasses go doctor get vision properly checked second tip get actual prescription doctor get lens one step lower like said eyesight actually fluctuates could 0.5 one day really stressed relaxing weekend eyesight could actually improve studies finding emotional states stress influences vision doctor tells eyesight say 0.5 myopia shortsightedness get 0.5 lens get lens 0.25 still give adjustment gives room vision improve get 0.5 vision go 0.5 get worse happened effectively created crutch created barrier vision getting better always go one step first thing many vision therapists recommend one tools used get shortsightedness 0.75 0.25 pretty much means need glasses time next thing want want install basic eye chart home something like door study william horatio bates lived early part 20th century study school classrooms would hang eye chart pillar school classrooms found classrooms kids eye chart teachers trained get kids go look chart see far could read week amount cases nearsightedness dramatically reduced beginning period 6 children nearsighted end year 1 nearsighted success one school system using eye chart classrooms introduced schools grand forks north dakota bates worked schools used charts continuously eight years many 2,000 schoolchildren unexpected result kids actually began see better normal children already normal sight 20/20 able read 20/15 20/10 nuts must eye chart installed home kids adults thing another really important tip studies kids found allow children sleep room absolutely dark means nightlight door ajar light corridor kids less likely develop vision problems future study blew away done university pennsylvania around 479 kids found sleeping dark room kids sleep pure dark room less likely develop bad eyesight happened divided kids three groups kids slept dark room kids slept room nightlight kids slept room lights turned traced kids see type vision problems kids would develop found kids slept darkened room 10 developed nearsightedness kids slept room nightlight 34 developed nearsightedness kids slept lights 55 developed nearsightedness important conversation got children afraid sleeping dark dark phenomenal sleep science showing correlation helping kids retain good vision final tip hire vision coach take online vision course numerous vision courses experimenting many even vision coach helped spent around five hours together results really really really promising course means got discipline typically got courses every day vision coach would spend hour week would spend around five minutes day going exercises prescribe whereas course typically spending 10 20 minutes day watching video eye exercises prescribed tip get obsessed bates

would like tell exciting new approach cancer therapy based sugar metabolism actually known long time cancer cells love sugar almost hundred years ago 1924 famous german scientist nobel laureate named otto warburg observed cancer cells eat lot sugar normal cells observation cancer cells love sugar known warburg effect warburg effect tells us normal cells stop one piece candy cancer cells stop eating candy take advantage warburg effect diagnosis cancer pet imaging pet scan patient pancreatic cancer patient given radioactively-labeled glucose lights concentrates organ pancreas normally light normally like eat much sugar case patient cancer cells pancreas eating sugar concentrating causing light pet scan able diagnose patient good taking advantage sugar metabolism warburg effect cancer diagnosis want take step use therapy well addition eating lot sugar cancer cells also metabolize sugar differently two major ways metabolize sugar one way use oxygen breathe convert carbon dioxide breathe enough access access enough oxygen also convert sugar lactate also known lactic acid experienced exercise unable deliver enough oxygen muscles run breath start getting lactic acid buildup feel muscle burn energy point view much better metabolize sugar using oxygen generate 36 energy molecules called atp 's convert sugar lactate generate well normal cells take sugar use oxygen convert sugar carbon dioxide generating lot energy molecules cancer cells eat lot sugar convert lactate even plenty oxygen available generate much energy would cancer cells use efficient metabolism well answer question think cancer cell needs cancer cell needs grow divide make cancer cells make cancer cells simply energy build new house simply electricity yes make energy sugar make things like dna rna serve genetic blueprints cell need blueprint build house also generate carbohydrates proteins fats need building blocks concrete insulation items build house think warburg effect supports biosynthetic pathways generate cellular building blocks want take advantage warburg effect understand detail favorite form sugar called glucose glucose metabolized mainly pathway called glycolysis many steps eventually generates metabolite called pyruvate without oxygen generate lactate pyruvate oxygen generate carbon dioxide enzyme generates pyruvate called pyruvate kinase altered cancer cells actually two major forms isoforms pyruvate kinase 1 2 one found many normal adult cells meaning cells longer growing 2 found every cancer cell study date make things complicated also found normal growing cells laboratory delete pyruvate kinase 2 normal cancer growing cells see would happen found normal cells grow well see yellow line pyruvate kinase 2 delete completely stop growing see red line cancer cells able grow without metabolism changed rewiring metabolism order able look metabolites put microscope look metabolites small need expensive sensitive experiments told looks like slurpee machine actually expensive instrument called mass spectrometer detect thousands metabolites based molecules mass instruments otto warburg access study cancer metabolism great detail want show data using instrument want look words want look colors black see lot colors black means metabolites changing see lot colors metabolites changing let us take look see cancer cells completely changing metabolism increasing metabolites yellow decreasing metabolites blue still grow without like cancer cells invading wharton center michigan state university figure coming wilson road well block wilson road delete road get find new way rewire route even though traffic indirect still find way without normal cells stop growing cancer cells continues grow rewiring metabolism laboratory blocking multiple roads multiple genes cancer cells stop growing normal cells continue grow talked glycolysis pyruvate kinase metabolism much complicated want give idea going shrink glycolysis move upper left corner screen going fill rest metabolism take deep breath let see metabolism complicated still simplified map metabolism remember normal cells came cancer cells pathways shared pathways different means understand normal complicated metabolism well cancer complicated metabolism exciting avenue therapy enzymes mutated deleted somehow altered cancer cells potential targets therapy research strategy first want identify key metabolic pathways help cancer want deeper mechanistic studies tell us exactly pathway helping cancer cells help survival growth invasion something else want take information use design personalized therapy know individuals different genetics diets environments begun understand different metabolism cancer taking advantage therapy many different types cancers kinds mutations one thing common eat cancer cells altered sugar metabolism want starve cancer

0,episode sponsored audible get started go audible.com/scishow text “ scishow ” 500 500 protein important component human diets since forever consumption meat nowadays number religious philosophical health environmental concerns associated amount meat people eating like talked love meat—my love meat—is harming planet meat consumption places like us continued rise time even though already eat way meat need nutritionally perhaps surprising seen number companies lately trying steer consumers away favorite meaty foods talking things like burger king ’ impossible whopper fishless sushi quorn—which despite name corn-based explicitly aim get carnivores like come veggie side people pretty much always non-meat options protein course tofu popular well thousand years one many options table alongside products like seitan tempeh even newer tasty things like morningstar farm ’ veggie corn dogs pretty big fan simply vegetable proteins available really reduced overall consumption meat well people like like meat studies suggested best way make meat substitutes attractive non-vegetarian consumers talk abstract things like ethics instead actually get stuff look act taste like meat recipe thing mimicking meat easy say slathering something barbeque sauce sticking bun today going break challenges science behind making meaty fake meats let us start things beef— specifically ground beef one meats protein producers would really like able replicate love burgers would think ground beef would fairly easy one nail taste part everything ’ ground anyway still got give right look see first impression piece food often sense sight rather taste smell studies suggest first impression actually modify flavor perceive type cognitive bias scientists call “ halo effect ” really make believable fake beef patty need something bleeds like real red meat technically “ bleed ” right word reddish juice comes steak cooking hamburger blood water mixed broken bits tissue color actually comes molecule called myoglobin myoglobin protein muscle cells helps carry store oxygen similar hemoglobin oxygen-carrying molecule red blood cells proteins get oxygen carrying capacity red color molecule called heme heme made single iron atom surrounded known porphyrin group made nitrogen carbon hydrogen heme group bind molecule oxygen meat cooked muscle fibers start break release myoglobin combines moisture compounds squeezed cooking meat form fluid gives signature “ bleeding ” effect visual thing heat breaks apart myoglobin protein releasing heme iron iron free catalyzes chemical reactions produce much aroma flavor compounds give cooked beef smell taste well helping color char meat couple ways approach recreating effect different companies different ways making fake beef beefy looking beyond meat uses plant colorings like beet juice recreate beef ’ color example impossible foods another meatless meat producer taken different approach mimicking myoglobin adding plant-based compound called leghemoglobin mix leghemoglobin another protein helps transport bind oxygen— one also uses heme group even similar structure ancient evolutionary origin myoglobin hemoglobin— found muscle cells instead originally found cells root nodules legume plants like soy beans helps get oxygen symbiotic bacteria live inside root nodules take nitrogen air turn compounds plant use grow original source leghemoglobin anyway really enough make extraction purpose practical digging plants pulling leghemoglobin roots would simply take much time money impossible foods uses transgenic yeast instead thanks genetic engineering able insert gene responsible creating leghemoglobin yeast cells relatively cheap easy grow extract protein yeast adding yeast-produced proteins mix protein material plants better simulate look actual red meat hank time taste test stefan yeah going test out—ah three different kinds food fake meats versus real meats hank okay double-blind nobody room knows contents envelope even researchers aware stefan yeah know different plates hank sam tell us get things right stefan first thing two burrito bowls labeled b stefan like said nobody knows one impossible beef hank okay stefan one them— hank beef beef stefan —is regular beef beef burrito hank vegetarian stefan olivia oh hell hank oh see little—i see beef olivia alright yeah stefan let us get some—yeah hank tastes like real meat stefan made good choice hank maybe olivia little too—mm hmm hank spent little bit time mouth olivia gets weird minute stefan interesting hank yeah first bite like “ is— ” like “ put lot meat flavor meat. ” stefan well let me—let cross hank said anything many arms olivia yeah stefan six normal amount hank well tastes like fake meat olivia still think one ’ real hank think that— think one ’ real stefan think going get little bit meat meat hank yeah olivia weird hard tell hank yeah similar stefan yeah incredible hank think fake think b fake stefan think b fake olivia too—yeah still think b fake stefan answer sam sam real meat hank ahhh stefan yeah okay sam b imitation impossible burger hank they—oh god stefan impossible beef stefan familiar ground beef hank okay yeah guess stefan yeah yeah yeah stefan one little moisture olivia one ’ spongy stefan maybe people stefan spongier hank yeah stefan good way describe hank sorta bounces stefan close like think would notice eating back-to-back hank right olivia totally stefan like ordered like would know difference hank seasoned think maybe covers fake-iness stefan yeah burrito bowl helps hank yeah bye everyone faux meat producers similarly invested visuals products example company called sophie ’ kitchen uses turmeric paint orange stripes onto shrimp substitutes matter good something looks also get taste right different groups trying make fake meats end asking question makes meat taste meaty heme part answer red meats seafoods whole barrel ... fish obviously still go certain markets get something looks tastes like fresh tuna except actually roma tomato peeled de-seeded cooked sous-vide tuna ’ seafood mimicked either producers creating faux salmon shrimp calamari scallops great eat scallops die fake one capturing fish shellfish ’ essential seafoodiness ultimately comes understanding compounds responsible smell taste meats contain thousands different chemicals contribute odor flavor different type meat chemical fingerprint sorts seafoods sodium potassium chlorine phosphoric acid commonly contribute fresh-from-the-sea taste instance one thing meats seem share savory “ umami ” taste according researchers capturing umami flavor one biggest keys successful meat substitute—and one biggest challenges umami “ savoriness ” one five basic tastes along salty sweet bitter sour chemically umami come number things notably comes compounds called glutamates found red meat amino acid form glutamate glutamic acid makes fifth amino acids found animal proteins lots different seafood especially high glutamic acid well though chemicals might part signature meaty taste exclusively found meat get glutamates sources seaweeds soy sauce mushrooms yeast extract add umami flavor hank walked room olivia said “ smells like inside chicken nugget '' hank like—it like smell chicken nugget— stefan oh loving hank —has distilled like like make buttered popcorn jellybeans chicken nuggets okay stefan got fish sticks ooooh olivia wow hank mean also look fake olivia uh-huh well yeah hard tell things like processed stefan yeah hank okay stefan oh boy hank going start less appetizing looking one stefan yeah let us—okay sure stefan yeah nicer golden color guess know stefan mmm initial taste better stefan okay taste like fish stick hank tastes like fish stick microwaved though hank seems real stefan felt real yeah olivia mm-hmm got like color variation hank coloration yeah stefan ooh yeah bet would fake fish though hank looks like fake chicken nugget flake like fish olivia yep fake one sure stefan mmm yeah hank dislike funny one looks faker bright yellow stefan uh-huh olivia one tastes much fishier stefan going say tastes like ... olivia good way stefan ... bad chicken nugget hank right saying b real us agree stefan mm-hmm answer sam imitation b fish meat hank b fish meat yeah pretty clear olivia yeah definitely hank still would eat day stefan oh hank maybe ketchup though stefan want ketchup turns edible plant parts like tomatoes naturally high glutamic acid— combined red color good choice fake tuna ending feeling like tuna well two parts low slow precise cooking sous vide may responsible one thing heat cooking make starches found plant cells become gelatin-like breaking cell walls secondly sous vide items typically vacuum sealed increase heat transfer water food putting fruit vacuum make tissue expand pressure restored tissue collapses becoming denser kind meaty texture course seafoods tend softer begin with—not faux meat textures easy get right ever cut chicken breast example notice meat kind “ grain ” like piece wood muscles made long narrow cells called muscle fibers skeletal muscles—the kind muscle animals use move bodies makes chicken breast drumstick—the cells arranged long bundles surrounded connective tissue space long cells filled myofibrils cellular compartments contain stringy proteins actual lengthening shortening muscle tissue main thing gives meat texture getting texture right seems important part making faux meat attractive example study 2013 exploring much consumers liked meat substitutes found people like textures soft wanted something like chickeny replacing protein content chicken straightforward since plants plenty proteins plant proteins use faux meat come long aligned bundles bunched chemists would call globular structure challenge figuring turn bunched-up proteins fibrous three-dimensional meat-like shape one method extrude them—a process looks lot like making pasta noodles something pressure temperature way higher scale way bigger start plant protein legumes like peas soy beans lot protein usually good place start protein extracted— soy beans example get series washes soaks dried— put machine looks kind like pasta press heated helps breaks molecular bonds holding globular proteins together—like disulfide bonds link sulfur molecules breaking bonds causes proteins lose shape unravel process known denaturing pressure flow extruder causes looser stringier proteins align linearly reach end extruder cooled allows reforming chemical bonds ensure keep fibrous texture done shaped strips crumbles colored flavored eventually shipped store one way hand could start something fibrous first place quorn meat substitute made filamentous fungus therefore known “ mycoprotein ” meat substitutes somewhat like muscles made mash-up cells arranged fine fibers though cells called hyphae branch-shaped make quorn hyphae mass-produced fermentation—when harvested apparently look kind like bread dough “ dough ” heated centrifuged recover fibery proteins mixed binding agent flavors extruded process similar plant proteins make even meaty texture stefan lastly got chicken hank ooh stefan ooh woah olivia strange hank

diseases nearly wiped children ’ lives endangered parents acting beliefs scientific evidence support talking crash course philosophy normally talk responsibility talking things philosophy sometimes face obligations philosophers argued epistemic responsibility – responsibility regarding beliefs epistemic responsibility especially interesting area philosophy many sub-disciplines overlap – epistemology brushes philosophy religion bumps ethics philosophers might argue live world could probably use lot epistemic responsibility – least people understand anti-vaxxers climate change deniers conspiracy theorists world full people hold beliefs without evidence – like us – encourage others share beliefs past 200 years philosophers developed pretty compelling responses phenomenon thinkers come useful ways thinking beliefs harm responsibilities go along meanwhile others argued sometimes hold beliefs without proof vaccines global warming moon landing – god w.k clifford lived england mid0800s vaccine existed smallpox even earned share scorn ridicule time clifford mathematician philosopher would probably strong opinions today ’ anti-vaxxers clifford one leading proponents epistemic responsibility time famously bluntly put way “ wrong always everywhere anyone believe anything upon insufficient evidence. ” instead using vaccinations example clifford told story ship owner said suppose guy owned ship knew old decrepit inspected long time ship scheduled make transatlantic voyage owner worried might make overhauling ship would pricey time-consuming time owner talked believing ship seaworthy ship set sail sank hundreds people drowned owner collected insurance money loss one blamed tragedy people would agree shipowner responsible deaths ship ’ passengers clifford went even argued owner would guilty even ship managed make trip safely guilty accepting belief without sufficient evidence whether actually leads harm still done wrong epistemically morally might argue “ right believe whatever want long hurt anyone ” yeah good question clifford argued thing private belief talk beliefs – us lot – causes beliefs spread even never vocalize belief still influences way act way others perceive way belief spread subtly insidiously without word spoken think kinds beliefs lack evidence example sexist beliefs imagine modern day sexist american university people going know actually expressing sexist views going fly sexist ’ beliefs even never overtly stated tend show ways interact women speak matter know know views know views subtly influence others particularly person position authority respect since views always potential harm others w. k. clifford argued epistemic responsibility believe things evidence evidence morally obligated refrain belief basically withhold judgment investigate situation let us head thought bubble explore flash philosophy tuesday teacher tells week pop quiz nice enough even define means pop quiz says quiz know coming advance reason however quiz impossible never study reasoning quiz friday wednesday thursday go quiz would know coming friday since would last possible day friday ’ means thursday either end class wednesday would

religious belief epistemically irresponsible belief god whose existence proven simply “ blind faith ” said blind faith leads person ignore facts arguments causing live unexamined unthoughtful life clifford described “ one long sin mankind. ” unsurprisingly idea met counterarguments let us hear one interlocutors 19th century american philosopher psychologist william james took issue clifford ’ thesis immoral believe something insufficient evidence james acknowledged one beliefs important – belief god – lacked evidence set demonstrate certain beliefs held morally even nothing really point back james recognized would ridiculous say ok believe anything wanted narrowed claim argue adopt belief options nature options basically determine moral defensibility beliefs end holding specifically said options face choosing belief could either live dead forced unforced momentous trivial face live option considering belief could actually see instance maybe never pumpkin spice latte love pumpkin love lattes love spice hypothesize would enjoy pumpkin spice latte live option – imagine believing would like pumpkin spice latte hand probably even entertain possibility would enjoy like dog food spice latte try might imagine accepting option actual belief dead option forced option one whatever made choice choose ‘ stay go ’ good example forced option one wait decide later wait decide stayed thus made choice unforced options opt choosing let pick peanut butter ham cheese always decide neither choice unforced option momentous option one choose stands chance radically changing life better accepting opportunity go international space station example could momentous option french fries burger would trivial – eat eat either way – going make huge difference life james said considering whether believe something sufficient evidence permissible still believe – long live forced momentous option religious belief happens fill criteria first james said believing god live option whole lot people also argued religious belief forced option buy idea agnosticism really thing figured withholding judgment believing – either believe god finally james thought religious belief momentous – possibility greatly improve life concluded justified believing god absence evidence faith alone problem justified believing god absence evidence also justified believing ok vaccinate kids option

believe work thousands thousands scientists dedicated lives studying immunology diseases say vaccinations prevent receiving deadly infections people know nothing science claiming vaccinations autism child autism happen also received vaccine take pick point science work anecdotes random stories random individuals little influence scientifically true partly testimonies never consistent many factors play example someone says eating potatoes obsessed stomach mean potatoes biological mechanism destroys stomach like someone claims vaccinations autism asthma mean scientists conduct studies

rights movement saw ten years ago well would say philosophy must go use legal nonviolent methods gain full citizenship rights negro people country course particular struggle philosophy centered breaking barriers legal segregation would say period basic thrust gaining citizenship rights negroes end humiliation surrounding whole system legal segregation dr. king something peculiar place started kind people attracted mean strong attachment part parishioners montgomery church older people yes would say large older people participated boycott ones using bus bus anybody else montgomery community predominantly church senate easy get vast majority negroes way connected church community addition commitment idea non-violence also thing could white community monopoly tried violence would met violence device open well put another way morally led non-violence felt best moral way deal problem seeking establish society feeling feeling violence certainly much socially destructive creates many social problems solves led non-violence deep moral reasons doubt fact struggle montgomery united states matter non-violence also practically sound would impractical negro turn violence neither instruments techniques violence ten eleven percent total population nation would say one-tenth one percent firepower would totally impractical unwise unrealistic negro think violence well saw beginning montgomery basic reason turned non-violence believed philosophy turned felt morally excellent way deal problem racial injustice country something non-violence made used past tense made useful amongst negroes ghetto negroes north would say anything makes useful southern negroes think true nonviolent movements south problem many years crystallized sense visible south many civil rights activities massive scale north three four years ago would say chance experiment broad scale non-violence northern ghetto feeling non-violence applicable workable northern ghetto south larger job frustrations points much deeper bitterness deeper think south see pockets progress really made strides visible every southern negro knows things today could four five years ago north negro sees retrogress find easy get vision centered target target opposition south consequently made despair men appoint cynicism feeling win simply means got develop mouth massive job organization mobilizing forces resources deal problem ghettos north done south south particularly alabama visible villains jim clark bull connor cattle prods police dogs north visible villains hard get people aroused directed something visible well exactly right saying said harder see target south nonviolent movement aided always whole brutality opponent way north thing legal segregation north south much difficult get people see exactly impossible job hard tedious job times get people aroused apathetic slumbers still feel negroes north motivated motivated south think time goes growing economic deprivation negro community even easier people come deceive something wrong general something wrong particular economic housing situations mean find subtle north subtle becoming much visible anybody see schools segregated north today 1954 supreme court rendered decision declaring segregation unconstitutional anybody look around ghetto see ghetto schools predominantly segregated devoid quality anyone moves major ghetto country see housing conditions people reminded forced live slums many instances often rat-infested vermin feel slums hard see exploitation negro confronting ghetto forced pay less constantly trying make ends meet either job result unemployment job economically unprofitable person make mean think see things coming see people north looking south supported struggles south coming see problems real got organized grapple something hypocritical fact south existed north could point finger civil rights acts passed early 60s could point finger anymore well doubt hypocrisy large segments nation whole question racial equality think best example many senators north west congressmen generally voted civil rights legislation 6 4 even 6 5 voting rights bill refused last year vote civil rights legislation dealt issue applicable north whole housing question seems greatest expression hypocrisy many citizens many senators congressmen nul part dilemma people knew negroes denied guaranteed constitution fact citizens country given rights feel white community said well given well think dilemma much deeper think one period transition honest america honesty impels admit america broad races elements still alive racism still existing american society many areas society northern south thing never single solid determined commitment large segments white camara america whole question racial equality think see vacillation always existed ambivalence always existed so-called white backlash merely new name old phenomenon see white backlash continuation ambivalence vacillation white america whole question racial justice existed since founding nation think thing must see time many people supported us selma birmingham really outraged extremist behavior toward negroes moment committed genuine equality negroes much easier integrate lunch counter guarantee annual income instance get rid poverty negroes poor people much easier integrate bus make genuine integration reality quality education reality schools much easier integrate even public park get rid slums think new era new phase struggle moved struggle decency characterized struggle 10 12 years struggle genuine equality getting resistance never intention go fall people reacting bull connor jim clarke rather acting good faith realization genuine equality think white people country talking non segregationist people devoid thinking devoid racism idea want negro america well depends level talking think make distinction people genuinely absolutely committed white community question racial equality must confess think small minority think vast majority white americans go far kind installment plan equality always looking excuse go far looking excuse negro mean every group came immigrant somehow easily somehow got around fact negroes black part growing grows something else thing anything without de personalizing something use something means end moment make thing de personal eyes fact negro slave country 244 years act willful thing done de negro brought changed treated human fashion led thing occasion negro looked upon person looked upon human status worth human beings thing human beings continue wrong without eventually rationalizing wrong slavery justified morally biologically theoretically scientifically everything else seems white america must see ethnic group slave american soil one thing immigrant groups face thing color became stigma american society made negroes color stigma never overlooked think things absolutely necessary thing america freed slaves nineteen 1863 emancipation proclamation abraham lincoln gave slaves land nothing reality matter fact get started time america giving away millions acres land west midwest meant willingness give white peasants europe economic base yet refused give black peasants africa came involuntarily chains worked free 244 years kind economic base emancipation negro really freedom hung freedom winds rains heaven freedom without food heed land cultivate therefore freedom famine time white americans tell negro lift bootstraps owe look legacy slavery segregation believe ought seek lift bootstraps cruel jest say bootless man ought lift bootstraps many negroes thousands millions left bootless result years oppression result society deliberately made color stigma something worthless degrading apart wanting live better us want raise one 's children better way better negro america know wants convinced almost every negro country scarred system become pathological process battle pathology nobody really knows means negro unless one really experience know battle constant drain feeling nobody nice spite think vast majority negroes country know want people want men want equality period boils able people men conditions lived syndrome deprivation surrounding conditions rather housing economic area schools vicious credit practices face ghetto problems closed doors constant defeats spite think know basically want men

values basis democracy well think see saying would first agree integration mean giving everything afro-american taint speak background think certain unique things within culture certain cultural patterns get process amalgamation really lift whole culture seems integration best opportunity participate beauty diversity think thing got see young people saying must revolution values country jimmy baldwin said one occasion advantage integrated burning house feel need revolution values america values presently exists certainly line values idealistic structure brought nation unfortunately true ideals many values called white middle-class scientist society values need reviewed re-evaluated real sense need changed think young people negro community raising questions raising profound questions total society words saying must restructuring architecture society values concerned would agree quest integration think offer whole nation something three evils nation racism economic exploitation poverty would one militarism think sense real sense three tied inextricably together going get rid one without getting rid stood lincoln memorial day august 63 said dream dream envision could see war asia preventing federal government needless preventing society negroes think done envision must confess period great period hope sure many others across nation many negroes lost hope saw solid decade progress south 1954 mean six four nineteen six three nine years supreme court 's decision march washington meant great deal high moment great watershed moment must confess dream day many points turned nightmare one lose hope keep hoping still faith future analyze many things last years would say last months gone lot souls agonizing moments come see many difficult days ahead old optimism little

mercury fed tuna sandwich mercury filled sandwich check blood levels amazed blood levels thermos exposed monkeys went blood blood mercury levels founded around seven days verse twenty four days ones ate mercury say read study say wow amazing looks like vaccine safer however large difference blood mercury half-life compared brain half-life 2 exposed monkeys indicates blood mercury may good indicator risk adverse events brain particularly conditions rapidly changing blood levels observed vaccinations data present study supported prediction although little accumulation mercury occurs blood time repeated vaccinations accumulation mercury brain instance occur sorry repeated vaccinations accumulation mercury brain occur brain good place mercury okay neurotoxic good thus conclusion regarding safety drawn blood mercury clearance data human infants receiving vaccine may valid given significantly slower half-life blood mercury brain observed mean kid actually heard mention study mentioned first part said hey shows clears blood quicker purposely ignorant purposely evil know man expert humans really want take care okay look institute medicine recent publications direct length maya fokin taining vaccines significant rise children nice diagnosed autism institute medicine reviews safety studies found sufficient evidence render opinion relationship ethyl mercury exposure development disorders children look yes link yes link enough like study okay look approach difficult understand okay love recently published second review appears abandon earlier recommendation well back away american academy pediatrics school approach difficult understand given current limited knowledge toxic oh kinetics developmental neuro city jeremiah saw compound continued injected millions newborns millions newborn say toxic know studies knows toxic know doubled schedule going study mean look journal neuroscience vaccines alter fetal brain development increase caesar susceptibility promote autism spectrum disorders ho bunk journals let us look national institute health pubmed anyone want go know idiots say oh vaccines associated autism look article titled positive association found autism prevalence childhood vaccination uptake across you.s population would value get headline well takes lot motivate would think would enough okay positive statistically significant relationship found higher portion children receiving recommended vaccines higher prevalence autism spectrum disorder neither parental behavior access care affected results since vaccination proportions significantly related disability number pediatricians matted states results suggest mercury removed many vaccines culprits may link vaccines autism culprits may like vaccines autism culprits may link vaccines autism anyone read okay pediatrician read mean value criminal lightened liability study relationships vaccines autism warranted kiddin look journal toxicology increased

okay comparing two found yes causal causal relationships big deal means actually caused okay anaphylaxis acute encephalitis swelling brain hypotonic move anything hyper responsiveness periods inconsolable crying screaming know shot anyone okay get rubella vaccine course acute chronic arthritis women interesting found insufficient evidence say causal presence absence causal relationship enough data study say yeah sure caused except stuff maybe know looking chronic darrell jeff meningitis rash beyond bere paralysis diabetes learning disabilities peripheral neuropathies mean like maybe make us check another analysis dpt chronic nervous system dysfunction nil analysis need new analysis know dbt causes neurologic damage one ones wiping vaccine companies said yes neurologic damage three possible scenarios okay committee posted three possible scenarios acute neurologic illness follow dpt might related chronic nervous system dysfunction go say look supporting know one scenario another okay happening seeing lot big rise neurologic problems one scenario dpt administration might serious acute neurologic illness subsequent chronic nervous system dysfunction children might otherwise experienced either acute neurologic illness chronic nervous dysfunction absence dpt means perfectly healthy kid inject got damage okay like two kids arizona another scenario dpt might trigger immediate proximate nibble still acute neurologic illness subsequent chronic nervous system dysfunction children underlying brain disorder metabolic abnormality something see inject would never gotten problem body defective okay got illness honest-to-goodness okay metabolic defective things third scenario one perfectly healthy kid gets neurologic damage neurotoxins dpt second one defective body could responded well got neurologic illness third one dbt might acute neurologic illness children underlying brain metabolic abnormalities would eventually led chronic nervous system dysfunction even absence acute neurologic illness already messed made apparent okay time time know anything epidemiologic studies case studies different studies made know fact epidemiologic studies ignorant science-based pro-vaccine people use epidemiologic studies problem epidemiologic studies designed find designed break perform new studies specific good book national institute health review mmr vaccine autism executive summary like findings findings unpublished studies shared committees publicly personal communications process sublet mitad publication seem provide additional evidence association measles mumps rubella autism spectrum disorder although findings still need peer-reviewed published subject scrutiny broader scientific community okay ignorant stop anyone want educated let us read paragraph two know doctors stuff read paragraph two although epidemiologic studies support association population level important recognize inherent methodological limitations studies establishing causality highlighted portion bottom furthermore rarity individual autism spectrum disorders difficulty determining exact onset therefore temporal relationship onset vaccination make certain epidemiologic study designs impractical impractical might say well vaccinated unvaccinated would would think would cool okay go starts thinking well know problems recommending see epidemiologic study came conclusion problem saying let studies even designed assess causality want actually makes sense really good scientists mean lam basted destroyed discussion recommendations related specifically measles mumps rubella autism spectrum question committee identified general concerns could adequately appropriately address report include deficiencies available information risks benefits vaccines inadequate discussion ethics providing information regarding risk benefits vaccines role public input vaccine advisory committees inadequate clinical provider information vaccine safety vaccine adverse event reporting system know recommends vaccines know went 23 33 69 called advisory committee immunization practices 97 percent people panels work vaccine industry studies

combined keep day one old baby alive think make sense best doctors world best hospitals world something wrong like well 2013 one 's ever really said stats gotten better came three weeks ago american kids seventy percent likely die adulthood kids rich countries opening sentence new study ranks 20 wealthy countries childhood deaths you.s comes last 20 countries may much money less children healthier dying 70 70 likely die mean makes sense always say doctor journalist investigate things make sense get possible vaccines made us healthy children dying people say well know back use problem maybe food maybe water maybe air okay could talk ensure sure people conference talking problem news talking numbers food sanjay gupta talking water know rachel maddow complaining one talking fact children dying alarming rates supposed advanced greatest country earth right let start program started national institute health study done last year 2017 came one big arguments make determining whether vaccines causing issues see society vax versus vac study feel like took databases sitting national institutes health cdc ran unvaccinated children vaccinated children say health outcomes higher rates cancer vaccinated higher autism higher multiple sclerosis list goes simplest study known man well refused decades guy peter aab doctor head vaccine program third-world countries least head deeply involved vaccinating third world nations decades decided year look back 30 years dtp program diphtheria tetanus pertussis vaccine reason looking numbers saw way ruled vaccine program kids

discovered compared dtp associated fivefold higher mortality unvaccinated currently available evidence suggests dtp vaccine may kill children causes saves diphtheria tetanus pertussis meaning deaths tetanus diphtheria pertussis dying things malaria dysentery things would normally able fight conclusion perhaps vaccine efficacious comes diphtheria tetanus pertussis hurting immune system fight issues fact numbers got worse fivefold got oral polio time got diphtheria dtp ten times rate death ten times rate death murder really accidental murder want remind vaccine used use american discontinued use dtap many lawsuits pharmaceutical industry whole-cell pertussis dtp vaccine switched 90s use vaccine anymore use third world question national institute health showing looked back thirty years would know vaccine killing children concern america giving 72 vaccines 16 different vaccines 72 doses specific children time surveillance system place capture one vaccines destroying immune systems like one apparently combination vaccines health institutions really monitoring vaccines working society question pointed set right front think going alarmed find conflicts interest type

bodies attacking sudden case talk grandma grandpa guy never heard thing one two kids bodies attacking people say well dell could water could air could food could vaccines could combination things sure want say happening immune system confused attacking cells would wise really investigate one product designed alter immune system life take vaccine trying trick body thinking disease really outrageous think somewhere tricking body think disease come fully contact gets confused starts fighting wrong parts body layman 's perspective doctors say well preposterous really preposterous certainly enough logic investigate deeply thoroughly things talking autoimmune disease numbers 1986 got 11 vaccines passed 1986 compensation act went 53 vaccines said 72 doses look time 12.8 chronic illness developmental disabilities 1986 54 percent 2017 yes aunt anecdotal coterminous run exactly right next look health outcomes children yet still want listen news anchors say really vaccines doctors say vaccines question prove know sure vaccines okay well responsible vaccine safety issue begins product airbag fails watched till ought recall millions cars car seat fails recall millions car seats case merck remember merck made vioxx caused heart attacks knew hit fda put drug news heart attacks 65,000 people killed drug settled three billion dollars lawsuit amazed company knowingly murders american citizens american citizens way killed vietnam war amazed company even work america ever happen make childhood vaccines wonderful beautiful company court case emails said inside doctors beginning question patients heart attacks merck put email marketing agents saying worry doctor questions safety vioxx hunt destroy live quote came court internal email company thinks citizens company said makes childhood vaccines hope feel good supposed charge safety happened 1986 vaccine injury compensation act essentially said dtp causing many lawsuits manufacturers saying make money vaccines anymore want put pharmaceutical industry also parents injured children wanted see way could court system would pay easier try sue multi-billion dollar industry go appeals processes government ronald reagan signed act reticent lee really nervous dangers taking liability away company axé products babies consequence sudden overnight incentive conduct safety studies manufacturers fact disincentive 86 act way sue get outside law recognize adverse event report think company say okay well hold second safety studies find adverse event report sued safety studies put market free clear liability right thought think dangerous free liability 78 million american children soon get vaccine put childhood schedule 78 million customers automatically overnight mandating laws know many entrepreneurs create sort product imagine able lobby government force product hands every child america mean cabbage patch dolls would ruled world okay obviously strong incentive develop vaccines become financially viable get sued advertise government 's going force onto people happens 11 vaccines 1986 looks like 2017 way 270 vaccines pipeline heard yet thousands vaccine trials going speak tell future pharmaceutical industry reasons said profitable product pharmaceutical industry sue vioxx sue oxycontin super vaccines even advertise way pharmaceutical industry number one powerful lobby washington today speak spending oil gas two-to-one wrap head around pharmaceutical industry need buying politicians rate 2 one energy going think trying push drug maybe maybe really like product force schedules mandate american population go health human services website find kids something called healthy people 2020 goal 2020 mandatory vaccine program adults money investigate story journalist one question always ask lawyer follow money money go whole push mandate vaccines children flu scare measles outbreaks trying get 2 kids vaccinated vaccinating worth anything 320 million americans turned human atm machines pharmaceutical industry going going deal schedule ends people vaccinate every microbe piece flint fleck planet going test safety hit market charge health human services works 1986 act takes liability away industry puts health human services oversees fda cdc hrsa nih let us talk well done conflicts interest major conflict interest right bat obvious anyone looks problem health human services cdc primary objective stop infectious disease noble objective putting promote vaccines distribute vaccines vaccines way scientific community right thinks stop way stop infectious disease primary goal hand job testing products safety look problem seen backs see exactly happened promote product millions people fact buy 5 billion dollars worth back seems distribute safety test finds oh goodness one really dangerous hurting children publicize terrified primary objective getting use vaccine go ultimate conflict interest gets worse okay fda acef face safety vaccines website says vaccines undergo rigorous extensive testing determine safety effectiveness okay true drugs mean look drugs drug approved lipitor four point eight year safety review period placebo group scientific method achieving safety product injected swallowed double-blind placebo study er placebo one group gets lipitor group gets sugar pill painted like lipitor neither scientist people involved study know one getting end 4.8 years put graph computer find rates cancer rates autoimmune disease know different types questions unmasked scientists everybody finds drug performance safely inert placebo sense went high school science done okay obvious enbrel thing six point six years got saline injection question would assume vaccines going exact process know know worked doctors television show people said vaccines dangerous think well would mean yeah sometimes things like vioxx slipped seeing big lawsuit something outing vaccines certainly going process take look hepatitis b vaccine given first day life hello welcome world gasping first breath going give first sexually transmitted disease called hepatitis b way like aids way contracted sharing needles sexually active prostitutes promising sexual behavior know plan raising 1 day old infant hopefully going long time vaccine even needed look safety review period comes right vaccine insert making days injected children days look good put market product glaxosmithkline merck five days placebo group inert placebo test see know anything put right market day one old babies know many babies fragile human alive remember said top babies died first day life every industrialized nation combined know give babies hepatitis b vaccines day one look polio 48-hour review period great another trick placebo studies placebo group got dtp vaccine deadly deadly vaccine killing ten times amount kids africa approved polio vaccine one group got polio vaccine group got dtp seem amount adverse events risk profile polio looks good put market make stuff goes way literally said heads national institute health cdc hhs missing something somewhere real inert placebo studies done file computer system access believe would like see hemmed hard sort shuffle chairs eventually said going show us use scientific method approve vaccines safety use use placebo based studies said would unethical right unethical believe vaccines fantastic even brand-new one ever come market like hpv going try fight cancer cervical cancer vaccine fantastic even get safety trial group children go placebo group three four years would disservice getting great new product therefore test question science ask whether think good science happened top health agencies united states america admitted robert kennedy jr. 10 people team never done vaccine safety study put market whatever want call unethical know children part one greatest human experiments history man okay process works order vaccine approved go fda group called vaccine related biological products advisory committee 2000 congress investigated verbeck called found overwhelming majority members voting members consultants substantial ties pharmaceutical industry committee members substantial ties pharmaceutical companies given waivers participate committee proceedings types waivers look instance three five fda advisory committee members voted approve rotavirus vaccine 1997 financial ties pharmaceutical companies developing different versions rotavirus vaccine people voting approve rotavirus added childhood schedule development rotavirus vaccine one five voting members ten million dollar contract roto virus vaccine one principal investigator merck grant develop rotavirus vaccine people voe saying yes children need going make billions dollars think greater conflict interest okay gets fda goes sit advisory committee immunization practices fda approved market going put onto childhood schedule officially want sip towei thing think vote mandating millions get vote goes committee million seventy eight million children going forced use product okay immunity liability immunity comes lands schedule free liability never worry included vaccine children program even pays children poor vaccine government 's going make sure get paid every single one product goes door alright investigation cdc grants blanket waivers aesop members regardless conflicts sip reflects system government officials make crucial decisions affecting american children without advice consent governed thing went list systemic lack oversight 97 committee members even filled conflict disclosures part paper took job 58 still unidentified potential conflicts 32 even looked 32 conflicts unresolved basically pharmaceutical industry sitting pseudo board acting like safety voting products children unsafety tested products kids finances break cdc gets 11 point five billion b dollar budget buy four point nine billion dollars vaccines distribute country marketing arm pharmaceutical industry also way 20 patents many childhood vaccines make money every sale vaccine still want cdc charge safety find problem vaccine patent think going tell right got revolving door watched vax know julie gerber dean head cdc time mmr study proves fraud looking mmr autism merck product julie gerber ding oversaw study basically kicked kids study manipulated study committed complete total scientific fraud happened goes work merck president vaccine department 2.5 million dollar salary congratulations job well done julie exonerated merckx products head company ok let us talk vaccine court second know dumping lot people always say well data probe laying data end give text message send bring home look site everything making published studies journals public record ok vaccine injury compensation program court system works judge jury press allowed filings submitted seal must fight hhs wanted think really hit year used sue merck child got seizures died vaccine sue vaccine injury suing secretary health human services suing government united states fight government say child injured vaccine use fight back department justice lawyers think corrupt department justice usually fight citizens country industries manufacturers break laws break rules put us harm 's way situation turned completely head fight prove crazy lying vaccine child injury incredible must fight without discovery allowed ask see safety trials looking allowed ask merck product get made happened none available would available regular court best part prove injury caused vaccine prove injury caused vaccine mean maybe work retail sell cars insurance supposed know science caused happened right eyes child got vaccine stopped talking three days later stopped walking never person upon prove caused vaccine thing accept science find scientific studies show vaccine causes injury supposed done studies health human services ones responsible safety person suing group suing one supposed done safety science never courtroom begin fact like murder trial murderer one forensics unbelievably extreme circumstances still paid 3.7 billion dollars injuries vaccine injury cap 250,000 pain suffering death okay solve ax remember william

0,hi dr. susan ream vice chair department infectious disease cleveland clinic pleasure talk morning vaccines adults grow think going needing vaccines anymore think vaccines kids going next 20 minutes show adults need vaccines population really vaccinated something need work want disclose member scientific advisory boards merck pfizer manufactured vaccines objectives today recognize fact low vaccination rates among adults look cdc adult immunization schedule learn use list recommendations various types immunizations adults get many us grew area vaccines available lots childhood illnesses certainly remember standing line child get oral polio vaccine school sunday afternoon miracle gotten point people necessarily recognize vaccine preventable diseases necessarily know come far vaccines concerned matter fact unfortunately children adults afraid vaccine illness nothing truth know adults know much vaccine indications vaccine preventable diseases know left-hand portion slide see red 2009 level knowledge influenza chickenpox course pretty high slight increase nonetheless knowledge two common diseases surveyed 2010 right-hand side slide look things like shingles pertussis hepatitis b meningitis even hpv adults know lot took surveys year apart knowledge whooping cough pertussis actually went quite bit still low levels bottom slide see 20 adults recognized pneumococcal disease something important importantly vaccine preventable lot go let spend couple minutes talking specifically current vaccination rates know individuals age 19 64 so-called high-risk talk little bit later low vaccination rates pneumococcal disease less 20 even among adults 65 everyone get vaccinated still less 60 saturation far concerned tetanus vaccination matter slice 60s percent new tetanus vaccine includes pertussis vaccine acellular vaccine less 10 particular survey hopefully going time hepatitis speed vaccine force kids young vaccinated born others may risk hepatitis b vaccination racer extraordinaire allele oh look bottom shingles vaccine herpes zoster vaccine fewer 20 people indicated age 16 actually received shingles vaccine busy slide one difficult read would encourage go cdc website type adult vaccination schedule vult adult immunization schedule come schedule basically two parts first side one speak age based immunization schedule looking color coding see getting vaccines age easy graphic representation followed something think internists use even called big indication based vaccination schedule across top page listed various conditions special considerations starting pregnancy immuno compromising conditions hiv infection line vaccine indications getting schedule following line would encourage go page download schedules importantly download two pages notes go along schedule notes get detail rationale new changes think small font tried footnotes would project well slide would encourage take peek done clinic actually post schedules recommendations walls patient rooms time point people waiting sometimes take peek ask us questions ask everybody comes update us immunizations got accurate record let us start talking influenza one vaccine everybody needs every year coverage rates united states low adults 18 years age 45 people getting vaccinated flu data current year ago data 12 13 flu season yet think going look pretty much seniors 65 years age older better rest population terms getting vaccinated 71 seniors got vaccinated influenza 1102 wins season range higher look people diabetes copd heart disease asthma use risk based indication influenza vaccinations anymore know complications may higher among adults know example obese adults higher risk complications influenza well fewer 50 people higher risk actually got vaccinated since 2010 indication universal vaccination every one six months age older new terminology lots choices terms type vaccines adults get iv terminology inactivated influenza vaccine refers killed vaccine traditionally given intramuscular injection li iv live attenuated influenza vaccine name nasal mist new last years several routes administration first la iv given people age two age 49 medical conditions nasal vaccine works easy people afraid needles good choice intra dermal administration new past years given short needle pain much less intramuscular remember skin processing influenza vaccine given people going local reaction intra dermal administration intramuscular high-dose vaccine individuals 65 years age superior antibody level generated high dose vaccine however studies still process see whether rate influenza actually diminishes result higher antibody levels year 2013 quadrivalent vaccine contains two strains two strains b inactivated vaccine trivalent vaccine contains two one b la iv manufactured 13/14 influenza season quadrivalent also injectable quadrivalent available well cdc made preferential recommendation quadrivalent intradermal high-dose call permissive recommendations either one one get think depend provider provider purchased lots new technology time talk today look forward improved influenza vaccines years think go quickly slide talked universal recommendation talked la iv either high dose regular inactivated vaccine fine persons 65 years age older let us move pneumococcal disease pneumococcal disease actually exciting era area major changes epidemiology last decade 15 years see conjugate vaccine introduced pediatric patients saw marked reduction pneumococcal disease peds adults well likely vaccine conjugate vaccine kids reduces carriage throat thus probably reduces transmission way saw improvement pneumococcal rates disease rates adults well children kind unexpected result say pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine use trade name important distinguish one new one become available adults recently pneumovax ppsv23 always indicated adults 65 years age older reduce invasive pneumococcal disease meaning meningitis bacteremic pneumonias bacteremia may help pneumococcal pneumonia something need continue study also recently indications use pneumococcal vaccine adults 65 years age chronic conditions various types common conditions see primary care practices copd various cardiovascular diseases diabetes chronic renal failure new products syndrome chronic liver disease asthma cochlear implants csf leaks various immuno compromising conditions everybody 65 needs get pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine also large group patients ages 19 65 chronic conditions mention splenius either splenectomy functionally splinting well anybody resident long-term care facility smokers also receive polysaccharide vaccine subset patients need get revaccination pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine see indications get another dose five years first dose get one dose age 65 little bit complicated terms gets revaccinated aware individuals get vaccinated age 65 need revaccinated polysaccharide vaccine enter prevnar adults trade name pneumococcal conjugate vaccine vaccine approved fda couple years ago recommended cdc 's acip committee months ago recommendation certain individuals immuno compromising individuals receive polysaccharide vaccine conjugate vaccine probably newest recommendation going talk morning conjugate vaccine works different way obviously polysaccharide vaccine hoped help immunocompromised individuals safe various forms pneumococcal disease immuno compromising conditions include things like chronic renal failure functional anatomic splenius csf leaks immuno compromising conditions like chronic steroid use hiv use biologic agents talking pretty large group adults unfortunately little bit complicated timing really important adult indicated group received pneumococcal vaccine past best give conjugate vaccine first give prevnar first would give way around give polysaccharide vaccine first conjugate work well someone never received pneumococcal vaccine gives conjugate first give polysaccharide vaccine eight weeks later polysaccharide vaccine patient week would never vaccine crohn 's disease biologic modifiers given polysaccharide vaccine hospitalized wait year give conjugate vaccine little bit tricky hope able build things various electronic medical records help help guide far things concerned going move zoster herpes zoster vaccine called zoster vaccine trade name want make clear chickenpox vaccine zoster vaccine important well talk patients older know somebody shingles know people problems post herpetic neuralgia phn shingles main thing stub acts reduce post herpetic neuralgia primary endpoint also reduce shingles know age increases people gets austere risk zoster goes age risk phn also goes age cdc recommends everybody 60 years age older get zoster vaccine little bit discrepancy may heard fda actually approved zoster vaccine everybody 50 years age cdc recommends given 60 enough partly related supply partly related risk illness line aware big question comes oh actually several questions come shingles vaccine one big ones vaccinate somebody immunocompromised evolving part people various chronic medical conditions vaccinated remember live vaccine higher dose chickenpox vaccine contraindications look back adult immunization table disease based table see red box means live vaccine contraindicated example know many women 60 years age pregnant happen would contraindication severe immunodeficiency transplant related types immunosuppression would something would make contraindication one thing news quite bit pertussis whooping cough keep hearing outbreaks various parts country made great strides control pertussis problem couple reasons cdc reinforced recommendation adults get least one vaccine say one recommended right tdap tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis vaccine addition important women childbearing age practice indicated give vaccine every pregnancy ideally twenty seven thirty six weeks gestational age best protection baby one reasons emphasis young old particularly vulnerable whooping cough something talking cocooning strategy mother dad immunized grandma grandpa baby sitters health care workers everyone going around child may vulnerable severe morbidity mortality whooping cough vaccinated well aware new information appears one reasons seeing pertussis children vaccinated inactivated sucks cues acellular pertussis preparation several years looks like wears little bit quickly whole cell vaccine whole cell vaccine dropped adults years ago caused much reaction good news seems like immunizing vaccine think whooping koffice around one final recommendation know kind ish thing practice skilled cared facilities patients skilled nursing facilities know people diabetes vaccinated hepatitis b recommending everyone hepatitis b ages 19 59 years may give others facilities particular diabetes aged 60 years age older summary influence easy adults get every year hep b certain adults including diabetics talk hpv morning often handled pediatricians obgyns recommendations carry adult phase well talked lot pneumococcal disease new recommendations use conjugate vaccine immunocompromised adults shingles vaccine every one sixty years age older tdap booster given everyone one tetanus revaccination given every ten years thanks much look forward talking specialty areas

glyphosate glyphosate ingredient roundup many different herbicides today pesticides glyphosate according studies stephanie sent us think interviewing right yeah one first show glyphosate allows neurotoxins like mercury lead cross deeper brain basically life assay almost ubiquitous eating organic stuff gmo foods right almost like saying opening door saying come oh yeah yeah positive body typically trying keep stuff saying know chemical sprayed know know place absolutely something invites toxins amplifies effect absolutely breaking gut barrier allowing toxins across gut remember gut barrier similar blood-brain barrier opening allowing toxins cross deeper mention creating disruption microbiome good bacteria affecting detox hormones neurotransmitters three-prong destruction occurring mean much damage cellular level kind perfect toxic storm today 's world today could say one things vaccinations could best thing take vaccines take moms amalgam take yo look life safe ingested start putting things together whipping quite cocktail genome reference point even try adapt perfect storm mean know watching know perfect storm three storms come together catastrophic storm occurs right happening know think going difficult ever say vaccines autism well look know could debate cows come home look happening know part perfect storms happening hepatitis b vaccine 200 times amount aluminum consider safe give baby iv difference know difference rejecting iv standards one thing giving two hundred times vaccination mean point amount neurotoxins something already utero getting exposed glyphosate know find mother 's breast milk opening blood-brain barrier allowing neurotoxins cross look statistic possibly things remain 2030 one two kids going autism spectrum seems impossible explain know perfect storm happening way graph charting right graph straight mean know maybe going hit better knows heard statistic even said wait minute sounds good sounds hard ibly think happening perfect storm generation say could see know develop detox protocols hundreds providers know throughout world incorporating somebody watching home right said know know back kids vaccinated right relating saying types actions take try remedy situation know one game changers understand started researching cell membrane many things happen know cell membrane key know think burst lipped really identified life happens membrane know mean everything happens membrane intelligence resides membrane anumita brain member brain membrane right mean understand want people much science know literally nerve system comes membrane right right lies intelligence membrane allows good stuff cell also functioning properly allows toxins come gets compromised think people watching hurt inflammation everything right mean talking inflammation sore shoulder inflammation every membrane becomes inflamed function way bad genes get turned turn fix membrane right first listen lot work detox fix membrane cell detox developed something called five hours fix cell became road map teach practitioners fix cell number two regenerating cell membrane fats key everybody paying attention fats started increasing fats diet even real butter breast fed butter arachidonic acid fat think people would think bad one right well know stabilizes membrane take something like rack tonic acid many parents loading child fish oil forgetting enough arachidonic acid fish oil actually becomes dangerous increasing fats grass-fed meats actually butter really game-changer today happening autistic world even know general population eats healthy taking fish oils actually creating something called omega-3 dominant imagine things wrong like everyone taking probiotic bacteria creating dysbiosis everybody 's taking fish oils thinking great creating something called omega-3 dominance point increase good fats afraid saturated fats help stabilize membrane cholesterol fad people fear would think many times practitioners give drugs try inhibit production absolutely fats know real foods grass-fed foods grass-fed butters fantastic know know fish oil like fish okay get fish oil selective rotate keep people know searching certain ratios diet play role even putting people ketosis key know ketones way product fatma ilysm break make something called ketone change brain heal brain science shows even turn bad genes changing people getting cells burn fat majority energy source called ketosis also really healing property ketone couple things right mom know right want try help kids way one thing get butter grass-fed cat actually meat grass-fed cows get natural sources things like fish oil compared extracted absalom put together help heal regenerate detox forget mean like also like coconut oil medium chain fats olive oils mono fats know get diet e olive oil okay lucky 100 damaging may take bad good fat make bad know adding fats diet sounds like obvious thing small thing really key fixing membrane fixing brain time anything else would give advice co somebody watching saying know right household kind would help well remove ensure five hours number one remove sources okay obviously remove sources brain eat non-gmo food get class eight remove sources life right look cleaning supplies using easy natural days mean know make goodness sake know eating organic know especially things like grains going eat grains sprayed glyphosate greens sprayed unless hundred percent grain way taking grains away another good tip goes fast way regulate cell inflammation control glucose insulin taking grains away actually faster believe even sugar seems take inflammation faster take sugars away process sugar grades big impact things grains gluten leaking across leaky gut driving inflammation autoimmune well think great advice sure people search know online getting deeper things know like said removing things facilitating know problems adding things like know healthy fats know could could make big difference people 's lives know personal know actually even adopted kids home vaccine damaged deal keep mad old story yeah said pain purpose doula tell story goes beyond story believe wife led toxicity even time story going end like mother breast cancer dying beuter cancer hormones got disrupted high lead levels one story another story tragedy family merrily much wife cousin lisa best friends boy girl seven year old twins time tragically died ended seven-year-old adopted whole nother story within story trauma vaccine damaged saw happening dillon yet dillon mean know even first vaccines said certain reactions next round worse literally sat father convinced vaccinate time felt like going send edge asperger 's sensory integration around age four really tipped ended kids age seven trying get help detox ended long got life back literally ended kids come thinking better great things get kids hold brand new baby six weeks old well went two kids know six six week old baby life 's good got two went two kids five six weeks know completely well yet know amazing story really took applied getting life back dylan like second patient met dylan today 's 20 would never know would never know met yeah exactly pain purpose know interesting know heard say one time lot times see immediate reactions vaccines time know boys girls might reaction times might somewhat different times see yeah said twins boy girl yeah wonder many people caught right yeah happened girl yeah seemed fine got teenager started developing sensory integration started developing increase pain appeared like fibromyalgia fatigue symptoms like even increase smell taste sudden life dropped ironically enough told interviewing tv show know told story even like oh gosh forgot started true silly detoxing getting ally told story came point boys testosterone actually amplifying effect neurotoxins like mercury aluminum estrogen protective effect like said autoimmune conditions may think dodged bullet later olivia 's story hits home people watching would end autism spectrum mean clear well one probably one caveat think typical process let us say know girl later things started show seem make take traditional allopathic physician going say well start keeping varying medications try know mask symptoms try make symptoms palatable additional toxins coming medications actually perpetuator making things worse compared know resolving nobody would ever canal vaccines long time ago years ago able aryans today would know loved philosophy olivia said something interview today said know age 7 took tons antibiotics brother right age 7 end home said taken antibiotic since strep throat earaches thought yeah great point know biological children never taken antibiotic ever know never taken drug dillon since got house changed philosophy right live life different philosophy right lived life different phosphate said got goose bumps man imperia would chosen like philosophy changed world changed world know going end autoimmune would reason said well philosophical note think leave thanks much work thanks sharing wisdom us still early welcome

problem years ago heard rotavirus vaccine growing porcine surco virus told worry people eat pork end apparently ok give babies mmm actually much research anything actually available aware far long-term effects infants consuming porcine surco virus things affect dna child 's dna function well know one 's bothered look issue consider children receive 10 vaccinations 1980s age five today get 636 vaccines beginning often utero first day life like united states human brains human immune systems definitely changed worse vaccines playing part epigenetic cysts vaccinologist say well vaccines train immune system epigenetic reprogramming want us look bright side always want paint picture immune system going improved see much medical literature states even vaccines prevent infections considering way improve overall health want give vaccines pregnant women addition animal cells associated genetic material also aluminium see dr. paul offit doctor mentioned beginning says infants tolerate 100,000 vaccines theoretically although never animal model theory well context medical literature astonishing one well published vaccine proponents paul offit key opinion person go-to soundbite american pro vaccine movement could publish website educates doctors worldwide vaccinations website children 's hospital university pennsylvania vaccine education center april 2013 could gone read concerns aluminium pregnancy could totally set ease seeing website say quote website said aluminium considered essential metal quantities fluctuating naturally normal cellular activity found tissues also believed play important role development healthy fetus hmm well pdf webpage april 2013 sent link one world 's knowledgeable aluminium experts usually diplomatic polite wrote back stating something flattering dr. paul offit repeat would think man considers highly educated would read following quote published 2011 dr. kawahara published important article needs read anybody concerns aluminium amongst things article beginning says whilst environmentally abundant aluminium essential life contrary aluminium widely recognized neurotoxin hibbett smore 200 biologically important functions causes various adverse effects plants animals humans goes great detail aluminium researchers know time dr. paul comments need look vaccines pregnancy closely starting aluminium see really body doctor cow hairs article important supports hundred seventy six medical references fact aluminium death factor cells reviews state-of-the-art techniques brought aluminium back forefront alzheimer 's research tells old research said related alzheimer 's flawed picture denotes problems documented found action aluminium body remember aluminium small radius highly positively charged element going attracted negative charges body able travel places really never go one places brain know cross blood-brain barrier crosses cells called macrophages special transport systems shuttle also know aluminium binds phosphate dna rna nucleus remember epigenetic stuff well guess binds phosphates nucleus influences many genes regulates abnormal ways gene function also know binds atp stands adenosine triphosphate may heard important energy molecule body used give know move muscle right run hill need well aluminium binds influences energy metabolism use know people aluminium excess end low energy also enzyme calcium magnesium know enzymes dependent upon certain elements order function properly right conformation need elements well aluminium highly negatively charged particle actually affinity enzymes normal elements supposed working comes pops calcium magnesium right takes essentially inhibits enzymes without enzymes metabolism really work well addition making enzymes useless fact bound keeps body longer makes half-life aluminium even longer see example protein know proteins supposed part separate jobs aluminium comes along cross links essentially works tanning agent coagulates proteins way causes conformational change right shape protein really important shape often determines function conformational changes actually inhibit degradation proteins particular proteases actually even use way body wants use aluminium huge deal comes proper cell function go back remind important development healthy fetus quantities fluctuate naturally normal cellular activity really scrutinize thing aluminium damages cell membranes remember going show another picture minute sorry got ahead cell membrane representation love phospholipids lipids middle phospho outside presence iron lipid membranes damaged antioxidant system presence aluminium pro oxidant reactions happen called oxidation basically like hydrogen peroxide actually toxic cells aluminium comes iron catalyze using certain enzymes problems membrane remember showed earlier cell membranes environment happening membranes everything genes function cell functions cells talk whether grow whether die differentiate turn different cells whether turn cancer look schematic cell membrane actually realistic appearing one saw consider cells around hundred thousand switches called receptors effectors meaning signal comes action okay opens closes various substances outside transmits signals inside telling nucleus consider fact aluminium exposure membranes myelin important nerve function becomes stiff dysfunctional dr. burr stratton wrote two articles really important detailed experimental model showing membranes changed face aluminium dr. kawahara listed several pages biological processes significantly altered low levels aluminium talked three medical references changed lipid phospholipids body change physical properties membrane change membrane fluidity think like kind car wash go flaps go proteins needing move like fluid almost like matrix proteins pop come back migrate important able move around way supposed area stays functional toss aluminium everything changes signals coming altered slide looks like handful going explain everything okay well never mind going explain slide detail da ps stands damage associated molecular patterns basically things cells recognize alarm signals response secrete chemicals called cytokines recruit cells come clean mess deal okay process inflammatory anti-inflammatory side comes dampens called pathogen associated molecular patterns going talk right aluminium comes causes cell damage secretes insides cells alert immune system bring substances came encountered including aluminium stuff leaked cells brings called antigen presenting cell antigen presenting cell starts secrete cytokines call cells cells recruit generations cells either inflame clean mess sometimes inflammation good actually helps clean problems kill bacteria dead flesh remove dead flesh need anti-inflammatory arm come along silence happens aluminium pro-inflammatory response th17 gets set one follicular helper cell system gets set one humoral immunity side antibodies secreted associated allergies also get set well documented established molecular biology th2 system skewed biased exposure aluminium actually basis use vaccines infiltrating cells come phagocytes come unlimited diet aluminium different get cut skin dealt done persistent particles continue stimulate process set oxidative stress bonfire skin system causes massive amounts inflammation cells eat die

whether needle makes difference comes aluminium going step aside explain top part minute thing hear websites like dr. pol office worried aluminium abundant metal earth 's crust eating drinking time baked goods worried mm-hmm well eat aluminium absorb somewhere 0.2 percent 1.5 percent okay inject aluminium absorb hundred percent inject two ways put directly blood vessel one study use injection put right intravenously get happening put blood vessel kind cell damage inflammatory response put blood vessel trick inject muscle vaccines delivered muscles goal vaccine injected intramuscular vaccine put adjuvant particle either virus bacteria set immune reaction hopefully cells remember encountered microbe future remember intramuscular key causing damage talking drinking still good idea need lot become toxic long normal kidney function okay adjuvant injected get cell damaged happens get cell damage cells usually break open mehta 's membranes open contents spill well turns contents inside cells designed inflammatory almost like acid want want take microbe dissolve want happen cells break open inflammation body happen sometimes need antioxidants diet bodies normally going happens cell breaks open atp comes dna comes uric acid comes phago lysosomes break open spill contents highly inflammatory okay calling immune cells helper cells come deal problem come encounter aluminum basically vicious cycle continues go body finally get get top vaccines actually worse others finding gardasil vaccine big problem dendritic cells get activated sometimes shut inflammation continues dose aluminium state anti-inflammatory state injected body injected really important needle muscle key wants argue aluminium asking different routes come body well presumed aluminium safe used food vaccines 70 years tested placebo people follow long term done long continues added vaccine schedule callous disregard many mechanisms cell injury vast medical literature toxicity injected especially america giving babies first dose aluminium pregnancy giving second one day one birth get 250 micrograms shot like start 1200 microgram doses boy presenting today got eight different antigens one day three times row huge aluminium load got time babies 18 months old getting around four point nine grams sorry four thousand nine hundred twenty-five micrograms brought bodies well one really important detail almost always left discussion comes aluminium whether injection ingestion kidney function person taken well know history aluminium dialysis fluids patients get really sick bones get sick brains function properly big problem know worked really aggressively get aluminium dialysis water giving dialysis important normal kidney function got degree kidney dysfunction chances aluminium going excreted hundred percent kidney function well low kidney function turns infants percentage compare using measurements adults premature infants really low kidney clearance know calculations reassure parents everything fine injected aluminium one adult man intravenously got rid reassure parents injecting newborns babies normal kidney function 90 milligrams mls per minute per 1.73 meter squared ways measuring standard consideration greater 90 considered normal well premature baby born around 20 see time goes average call glomerular filtration rate clearance substances kidney need filtration 2 8 day old average around 40 ranges 17 60 actually really low clearance never checked see injecting aluminium babies see even 2 12 years say low level low range 89 average 6 months kids kidney function speed take consideration analyses rarely almost actually never seen taken consideration aluminium analysis actually injected real babies looked see happened afterwards one came year dr. moses injected two month-old human infants three intramuscular one injection three vaccines basically according schedule total twelve hundred micrograms aluminium per usual infant schedule amounts 545 micrograms per kilogram baby weight hmm conclusion study measured urine blood aluminium levels 12 hours injected said reassured find significant post vaccine rise serum aluminium level vaccination preterm infants containing twelve hundred micrograms literature study found also rise blood levels urine levels injection thought well would relieved injected aluminium see rise blood rise urine go wrote doctor asked said aware kidney function babies actually really low would surprised see lot aluminium urine find blood else could gone could go organs bone wrote back said quote really know happens aluminium point time said research needed area okay something called minimal risk level theoretical calculation exceeded according theoretical calculation could neurotoxicity really problem aluminium primarily brain sensitive nervous system sensitive well really interesting paper calculations go read paper see first calculations based rodents eating aluminium way looked one injection study priests mentioned already looked one man got small 0.7 micrograms ok nowhere near baby gets intravenously tagged radio labeled radio labeled aluminium could trace system time see went found said great aluminium disappeared blood two days fifteen percent taken body immediately excreted halloween aluminium body four percent eleven hundred seventy eight days three years also used form aluminium toxic aluminium hydroxide aluminium phosphate used vaccines use aluminium citrate kidneys also normal measurements using theoretical calculation intravenous dose one man low dose normal kidneys rats eating aluminium based say exceed certain dose aluminium every day look theoretical ingestion breast milk vault low levels aluminium breast milk low levels formula higher levels vaccines looked saw well calculating minimal risk line let us see add together goes higher minimal risk line conveniently see spike little bit right well one things breast milk formula aluminum substances eat silicate earth 's crust totally different aluminum phosphate aluminum hydroxide ingesting okay problem analysis looked hepatitis b dtp vaccine left pneumococcal hepatitis another 600 micrograms aluminium even though found spikes three days time went minimum risk level reassuring probably okay vaccines really big problem formula breast milk look comes right back stays line telling babies kidney function high adult man rats tested injecting form using animal studies look whole vaccine schedule essentially telling toxic even small amounts vaccines terrible analysis dr. cohn scientists 2013 looked

hypocritical course difference two things vaccines developed long periods time experts field tested deemed safe go rigorous kind testing regulations safety checks give public definitely trust pretty unregulated private company also create essential oils look website transparent lot things seems longer daniil studies done effects given things like trs detox anyone particular children really know safe least could find information wrong please let know mary laughs company admits work quality standards created like outside regulation one kind watching checking okay little dodgy admit use

symptoms lead diagnosis correlation mean causation completely wrong blame vaccines increase illnesses mentioned post take autism example causal link vaccines autism disproven many many times one paper written suggesting link debunked completely blown apart shown absolute rubbish know many times say correlation equal causation link something mean one thing really interested kind stuff want proof fantastic website called spurious correlations basically shows graphs pump two variables show correlation obviously like insane would would ever causal link example one correlation mean increase you.s
