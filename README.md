# NOTE

The code in the repository is based on an example found here: https://bit.ly/3R16TPW 
It was used as a guide for completing my Final Year Project at the University of Guyana

# How to Run

The notebooks are Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb), VS Code is a lightweight option though you'll need to install all of
necessary extensions for it to work. Anaconda is the more robust option for running the notebook files.

If you can't run the notebooks, reach out to me at richardnero592@gmail.com
